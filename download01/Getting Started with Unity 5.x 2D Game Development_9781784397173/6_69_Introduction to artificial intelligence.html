In fact, due to its complexity, it's one of the hardest parts to program for a video game. A good AI programmer should have knowledge of math (such as graph theory, Bayesian networks, operational research, and so on), physics (such as the motion equations) and psychology (to understand how the player reacts to AI in the game). Whereas the first two are well known, the last one is sometimes neglected, but is just as equally important. In fact, sometimes the most believable behavior of an NPC character is not the most enjoyable for the player. If you are interested in learning more, I wrote an article that you can find on my website at <a class="ulink" href="http://francescosapio.com/" target="_blank">francescosapio.com</a></p><p>However, I hope I haven't scared you by quoting such concepts of mathematics. In fact, in these sections, we won't cover such complicated things, but it is useful to have an idea about the foundations of what we will do, even if we will only create a simple ground to make our tower defense game work. In any case, I invite you to learn more about artificial intelligence in video games, since what you can achieve is really awesome!</p></div>
