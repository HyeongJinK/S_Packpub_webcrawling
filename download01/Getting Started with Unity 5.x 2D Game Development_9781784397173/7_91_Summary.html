In doing so, we have finished the implementation of our tower defense game.</p><p>The Pandas walk towards the player's cake to eat it, the cupcake towers shoot at them, and so Pandas die and they are periodically spawned as well. The player can buy, sell, and upgrade cupcake towers. A main menu is present and the player can either win or lose. So, our game is complete. Or is it not? Can we go even further? Let's find it out in the next chapter.</p></div>
