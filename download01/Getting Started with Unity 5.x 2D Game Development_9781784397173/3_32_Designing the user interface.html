The whole process is pretty straightforward and hassle free. Players expect the same experience, not only with gameplay, but also with other on-screen elements such as the UI. The design of a UI requires considerations of a number of things. For example, the platform that you are designing for has limitations, such as screen size, and the types of interaction that it can afford (does it use touch or a mouse pointer?). But physiological reactions that the interface might give to the player need to be considered, since he or she will be the final consumer. In fact, another thing to keep in mind is that some people read from right to left in their native languages, and the UI should reflect this as well.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that if you are designing for multiple devices, try to keep the experience the same. With many applications being multi-platform, you don't want the user getting used to an experience on a mobile that is presented in one way, and then to log on to the computer version, and it's completely different. Therefore, while you are designing the UI, determine how it will look on each device. Is the home icon too small on a mobile to understand what it is? Is the navigation menu too large for a desktop version? Making sure that the UI is optimized will ensure that users who use your application across multiple devices will have a seamless transition and won't have to try to figure out how to access features all over again.</p><p>Just like our book example, players or users of applications are used to certain conventions and formats. For example, a house icon usually indicates home or the main screen, an e-mail icon usually indicates contact, and an arrow pointing right, usually indicates that it will continue to the next item in the list, or the next question, and so on. Therefore, to improve ease of use and navigation, it is ideal to stick to these or to at least keep these in mind during the design process. In addition to this, how the user navigates through the application is important. If there is only way to get from the home screen to an option, and it's via a whole bunch of screens, the whole experience is going to be tiresome. Therefore, be sure to create navigation maps early on to determine the route for each part of the experience. If a user has to navigate through six screens before they can reach a certain page, then they won't be doing it for very long.</p><p>Loud noises can immediately get people's attention. So can UI elements. Therefore, you want to make you more important elements the focal point. The key here is to have fewer elements, if not only a single element, the focal point to reduce the player from feeling overwhelmed. For example, in a game, you may want the health bar to be the main item of focus. Therefore, place it somewhere where it will be noticed and not in the corner in the player's peripheral view. One way to achieve this is to have the UI elements contrast the environment, ideally within the same color palette so that they stand out, but not draw so much attention that they are distracting.</p><p>A great website to create great color schemes is Adobe Color (<a class="ulink" href="https://color.adobe.com/" target="_blank">https://color.adobe.com/</a>). An example of it can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_03_001.jpg" /></div><p>In saying all of this, don't let the design over take the practicality of the user's experience. For example, you may have a beautiful UI but it makes it really hard to play the game or it causes too much confusion. Particularly during fast-paced gameplay, you don't want the player to have to sift through twenty different on-screen elements to find what they are looking for. You want the level mastery focused on the gameplay rather than understanding the UI. One way to also limit the amount of UI elements present at any one time is to have sliding windows or pop-up windows that have other UI elements present. For example, if your player has the option to unlock many different types of ability but they are only able to use one or two of them at any single moment during gameplay, there is no point in displaying them all. Therefore, having a UI element for them to click that then displays all of the other abilities, which they can swap for the existing ones, is one way to minimize the UI design. Of course, you don't want to have multiple pop-up windows, otherwise it becomes a quest in itself to change settings in-game.</p><p>One thing that a UI can offer is feedback. Feedback is not necessarily a pop-up screen that is displayed in the center of the screen; it can be something as simple as a meter increasing/decreasing, such as a health bar, or a player's avatar changing over time; for example, they begin to age as the player progresses through the game. The next thing about adding feedback is how you are going to alert the player to changes in the UI. In some instances, it is not necessarily to alert the player, it's just a natural part of the process; in others, they need to know that changes have occurred or are occurring. One way to indicate changes to a player is to animate the UI element in question. This can be as simple as a glowing effect; for example, each time the player is attacked their health meter glows or pulsates as it decreases. Another option is to indicate that changes are occurring in the UI with sound; for example, each time the player's currency increases, a soft chime sound plays. Audio can be just as effective as an animation, but also keep in mind that feedback that is based on audio won't always be heard. For example, sometimes, players opt to disable the sound if they are in a public place and do not have headphones, so keep this in mind if you are using sound as the only way to indicate a change in the UI to the player. In addition to the types of feedback, each action needs a reaction, and if the player does something that they are not supposed to do, they need to be notified. So each time that a player provides input, clicks a button, or interacts with the UI, something should happen. How prominent it is is up to you; just make sure that it is clear and not over the top.</p><p>This section gave you an introduction into the issues behind designing a good UI. There are so many other factors to take into account that specific books just about UIs have been written. For instance, one of these is localization, which is so vast that a whole chapter is needed to describe it (you can find a brief introduction to Localization in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What Is beyond the Cake?</em></span>).</p><p>However, before moving on, I just want to point out a technical term about UIs, since it also appears in the official documentation of Unity. Some UIs are not fixed on the screen, but actually have a physical space within the game environment. Some designers call these UIs <span class="emphasis"><em>diegetic</em></span>, as opposed to classical interfaces that are <span class="emphasis"><em>non-diegetic</em></span>. It is a term that has been borrowed from other disciplines, and therefore is not unanimously accepted for UIs. In fact, it might even cause a little confusion. Just to provide you with a bit more of a historical background, the term derives from the word <span class="emphasis"><em>diegesis</em></span>. We can see its definition in the Merriam-Webster dictionary:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"the telling of a story by a narrator who summarizes events in the plot and comments on the conversations, thoughts, etc., of the characters."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>An example of a diegetic interface, or just for simplicity an UI placed within the game word, is the minimap of the game <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Space</em></span> (Visceral Games, former EA Redwood Shores), which we can see in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_03_02.jpg" /></div></div>
