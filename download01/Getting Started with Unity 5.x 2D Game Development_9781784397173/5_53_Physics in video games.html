Imagine if every weapon fired a bullet in the same way, regardless of the firepower. Then what would be the point between having a sniper rifle or a revolver? This is only one aspect of the role that physics plays in games. Physics in games does not just revolve around trajectories and force; it can include gravity, time travel, and fluid dynamics.</p><p>Some great examples of games that use physics include <span class="emphasis"><em>World of Goo</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Portal 1</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mario Galaxy</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Kerbal Space Program.</em></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_05_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Portal 2 - An orange liquid that reduces friction so much to give you a substantial boost</p></div></div><p>Of course, at the other end of the spectrum, games don't always replicate physics in the most accurate way but rather exaggerate it or dismiss it altogether to allow for innovative and unique gameplay. An example of this would include taking a <span class="emphasis"><em>Leap of Faith</em></span> from great heights in <span class="emphasis"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></span>, into conveniently placed stacks of hay (and even water). Some people have even studied how much hay that you would actually need in order to survive such jumps, which you can find here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/06/kotaku-bureau-of-weights-measures-studies-fallout-physics-also-beer/" target="_blank">http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/06/kotaku-bureau-of-weights-measures-studies-fallout-physics-also-beer/</a></p><p>When it comes to adding physics to your own game, you must ask yourself to what extent you want your gaming experience to be real. If you want your game to be 100% identical to reality, then you must also consider things like death. If a character can be shot by a bullet, do they bleed out or can they heal themselves? In some cases, your game may end up more of a simulation than a game itself if the interaction is too real. An example is <span class="strong"><strong>permadeath</strong></span> (where the player must restart the game from the beginning after they have died), which you may or may not want in your game/simulation. All of these factors need to be considered when adding physics into games because both the cause and effect will all contribute to how believable the game is and ultimately how enjoyable it will be.</p></div>
