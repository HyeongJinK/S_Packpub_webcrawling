Then, we wrapped them within a controller and built a finite state machine to define how these animation clips are linked, through transitions. Finally, we wrote a script to trigger the different states of the machine.</p><p>Now that we have seen how to animate our Pandas, it's time to move on to the next chapter, maybe after a coffee break.</p></div>
