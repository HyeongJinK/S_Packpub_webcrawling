So keep in mind the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Increase the readability of your code through documentation (we will see later in <span class="emphasis"><em>Teamwork</em></span> section) for your programmer's colleagues.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make a nice interface in the Inspector (also by using custom inspectors; see later) so that it is easy to use by designers (an example is exposing events, which we are going to explore in the next section).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec111"></a>Exposing events</h3></div></div></div><p>If you are programming a very cool script that needs to interact with other elements in the game, you can actually expose your own event in your scripts.</p><p>In fact, you can add this library to your code:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine.Events; &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you will be able declare and trigger events in the following way:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Float variable just for test. Can be set in the Inspector.</em></span> &#13;
public float myFloat; &#13;
 &#13;
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Declaration of the event class. It has a float as parameter to pass.</em></span> &#13;
[System.Serializable] &#13;
public class OnEveryFrame : UnityEvent&lt;float&gt; { } &#13;

<span class="emphasis"><em>//Function that is called every frame</em></span> &#13;
void Update() { &#13;
 <span class="emphasis"><em> //fire the event at every frame</em></span> &#13;
  OnEveryFrameEvent.Invoke(myFloat); &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>This is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_003.jpg" /></div><p>Cool, isn't' it?</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec112"></a>Sprinkles pooling</h3></div></div></div><p>Instantiating a game object in Unity is a slow operation; as such, every time the cupcake tower shoots, a new sprinkle is instantiated and then removed from the game.</p><p>A much better solution would be to do object pooling, which is an optimization technique (we anticipated something about this in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers</em></span>). The concept is to instantiate a fixed number of sprinkles at the beginning and keep them off-screen. When a cupcake tower shoots a sprinkle, it just takes a sprinkle from this pool and shoots that. When the sprinkle is supposed to be destroyed, instead, it is moved back into the pool off-screen so that it can be picked again by another tower.</p><p>In a scenario where there are many towers shooting, this can dramatically improve the performance of your game, especially if you are targeting a mobile platform.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec113"></a>Saving your data</h3></div></div></div><p>We haven't discussed saving the data for the game (unfortunately we couldn't cover everything in this book). However, Unity offers a class called <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> (official documentation: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html</a>), which is great to save some values between sessions of your game, such as the score.</p><p>If you need to save many things, you should implement your own solution by saving your own file. What format to use for the file is up to you. Unity offers built-in support for XML since many versions, and just recently Unity has also included built-in support for JSON files.</p><p>Lastly, you should also consider saving data to the cloud, such as on an online database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec114"></a>Debugging</h3></div></div></div><p>Bugs are nasty to fix, but you have a very powerful ally: the console. Don't underestimate the value of this tool. This is because it will save you from many situations, and although at the beginning it could seem that what it is logging doesn't make sense, with time you will learn how to interpret those messages and correct bugs fast.</p><p>Another great way to use the console is by inserting debug logs. In Unity, they can be printed with the <code class="literal">Debug</code> class. Here is an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Debug.Log("This is a string that will be printed on the console"); &#13;
</pre><p>Placing this line of code in strategic places can help you identify the bug and eventually correct it.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec80"></a>Remote Logs</h4></div></div></div><p>Unity offers the possibility to use your powerful ally (the console) remotely if you are targeting another platform. For instance, for Android devices, you can read this (which actually allows you to have not only the console by using an ADB connection but also a debugger):</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AttachingMonoDevelopDebuggerToAnAndroidDevice.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AttachingMonoDevelopDebuggerToAnAndroidDevice.html</a></p><p>Otherwise, you can implement your own solution to show console logs or check out code written by other people. For instance, you may want to give this free asset a look:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12294" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12294</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec81"></a>Cleaning the release version</h4></div></div></div><p>However, you should remember to remove these lines of code from the final version; otherwise, they consume computational power that you could've used in another way.</p><p>A great way to deal with debug statements is to create another class that prints a debug message. If you include the <code class="literal">Diagnostics</code> library, you can define a conditional attribute such as the following class:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine; &#13;
using System.Diagnostics; <span class="emphasis"><em>//Needed for the Conditional attribute</em></span> &#13;
 &#13;
public class myDebug : MonoBehaviour { &#13;
 &#13;
  [Conditional("DEBUG_MODE")] <span class="emphasis"><em>// Conditional attribute</em></span> &#13;
  public static void Log(string message) { &#13;
   <span class="emphasis"><em> //Print the message in the console</em></span> &#13;
    UnityEngine.Debug.Log(message); &#13;
  } &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you can use the following line of code, instead of the preceding one:</p><pre class="programlisting">myDebug.Log("Hello World"); &#13;
</pre><p>This line will be compiled only if the <code class="literal">DEBUG_MODE</code> attribute is defined within your game. You can check which attributes are present in your game by navigating through <span class="strong"><strong>Edit | Project Settings | Player</strong></span>. In the following screenshot, you will find where to define such attributes/symbols highlighted, and as you can see, I've also added the <code class="literal">DEBUG_MODE</code> attribute (which you should remove before shipping your game):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_004.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip115"></a>Tip</h3><p>For a very nice implementation of this system, you can take a look at the code in this link: <a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/kimsama/4123043" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/kimsama/4123043</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec115"></a>More about communication between scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>In the last chapter, we saw many ways in which scripts can communicate with each other. However, Unity offers many other ways. One of these is messages to trigger functions. In fact, you can send a message to a game object asking to trigger a certain function if that function exists in any of the scripts attached to that game object.</p><p>However, this is an expensive (from a computational point of view) method to communicate between scripts, and it should be used only when necessary.</p><p>Moreover, Unity offers more than one messaging system, each one of them with their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>In any case, these systems can be used to create your custom message system, which is a great way to broadcast messages to many scripts when certain events happen, for instance, when you need to switch difficulty at runtime and many scripts should be aware of the change (refer the <span class="emphasis"><em>Switching difficulty at runtime</em></span> section, for more information<span class="emphasis"><em>)</em></span>. You can find many implementations online, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Advanced_CSharp_Messenger" target="_blank">http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Advanced_CSharp_Messenger</a>, but I strongly advise you to create your own, since you will definitely learn more in this way. For instance, you can follow this tutorial: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/events-creating-simple-messaging-system" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/events-creating-simple-messaging-system</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec116"></a>Documenting the code</h3></div></div></div><p>When you work in a team, you need to properly comment all of the code you write. There are tools to help you automatically generate documentation, but you need to take the efforts to comment everything!</p><p>It may be worthwhile to also use the summary tag, which I didn't use in creating the tower defense project in order to increase the readability of the code for this book: <a class="ulink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2d6dt3kf.aspx" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2d6dt3kf.aspx</a>.</p><p>In any case, when you write your code, you should always maintain a balance between performance and readability, which often are in contrast. If the documentation is rich and full enough, even the most complicated performance optimization that makes code unreadable can be understood. Keep in mind: maintaining a level of elegance in your code should be your guiding principle when you writing it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec117"></a>Protecting your game</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you have your game, you may want to protect it from piracy and/or game hacks. About this, there is an extensive literature, as well as different opinions about it. In fact, one of the major critique to these systems is that they make hackers' lives more difficult, as well as legitimate players' ones; the game will be eventually cracked, and you will end up with upset players. On the other hand, the opposite school of thought says that the major amount of revenue that is generated from a game happens in the first month from the release date (we are talking about non-online games) and therefore a protection system that lasts on month has done its job.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note116"></a>Note</h3><p>One of the most popular (among both players and hackers) anti-piracy system used for games is Denuvo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.denuvo.com" target="_blank">www.denuvo.com</a>). Although Devuno has received many critiques, it has kept many games from by being immediately cracked and is still giving a hard time for cracking others. You can find a list of games protected with this system (whether they have been cracked yet or not) here on Wikipedia: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denuvo" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denuvo</a>.</p><p>For the most curios of you, Denuvo is an anti-tamper and not a <span class="strong"><strong>Digital Rights Management</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DRM</strong></span>) system (which binds a legitimate copy of the game to an user). An anti-tamper makes harder to reverse engineering a DRM system in order to by-pass it.</p></div><p>However, in case you decide to include some kind of protection for your game, but you don't have time to develop your own systems, you can buy inexpensive and useful security tools from the Asset Store, such as these ones: <span class="emphasis"><em>Anti-Cheat Toolkit</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395" target="_blank">www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395</a>) or <span class="emphasis"><em>PlayerPrefs Elite</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18920" target="_blank">www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18920</a>).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note117"></a>Note</h3><p>For more advanced protection systems (such as the aforementioned Denuvo), of course the price increases, making it hard for Indie game developers to afford one of them. In conclusion, before you spend part of your budget on a protection system, think carefully if it is necessary for your game.</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note118"></a>Note</h3><p>Here is a short, fun, and easy historical overview of DRM systems: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjEbpMgiL7U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjEbpMgiL7U</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec118"></a>Building for more than one platform</h3></div></div></div><p>When you consider shipping your game on different platforms, you should keep in mind the different platforms you are going to target. Do they have touch input? Do they support controllers? Based on this, you need to modify the code in your application so that it can work in more than one platform.</p><p>Unity offers the possibility to insert some assembly directives to compile the code in a certain way. For instance, you may want to compile a small bit of the code in a certain way when the game is built for Android rather than for Windows. Here is the link to the documentation: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html</a>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip119"></a>Tip</h3><p>For fast prototyping on devices, you should consider some emulators (we will see later in the chapter). However, Unity provides for Android devices an application called Unity Remote (you can find it here on the Play Store: <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote</a>), which allows you to test your game directly with your device from the Unity Editor through an USB connection.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec82"></a>Input/output devices</h4></div></div></div><p>What will the player use to play your game and how will it be used during gameplay?

This is very important and can determine the success or not of your game. In order to proper balance your game, you need to do a lot of playtesting (we will see more about this later).</p><p>Imagine that we are playing a co-op game and I have a magical wand, special powers, and an invincibility. You, on the other hand have a flashlight. This clearly isn't balanced unless the flashlight was a compact version of all the stuff I had, which unluckily for you it's not. Now, this isn't just an issue when it comes to two player or even multiplayer games but also single player games where the AI are highly powered and drain all of your resources just to defeat them, if you can at all. The same goes for having limited opportunities to get power ups while other players are clearly not having any issues.</p><p>Balancing games is important for many reasons because it provides an even playing field and gives everyone the opportunity to win, lose, and progress. With every iteration of your game, and every subsequent update (especially if you change something significant), make sure that your game is balanced. For single and co-op games, this will be something that you can iron out with playtesting. For large-scale MMOs, you are able to playtest but there are likely to be unbalanced things that will come to light the longer people play, explore the world, develop and upgrade their character, and progress through the world.</p><p>One of the many ways that you can approach the balance of games is via a cost analysis approach. In this approach, you can begin by adding, removing, and substituting different features in your game. For example, instead of adding a new character, make an existing one more powerful, or replace it with a more powerful version of itself. So, instead of a <span class="emphasis"><em>Special Wizard</em></span>, substitute it with an <span class="emphasis"><em>Epic Wizard</em></span>. Alternatively, you could remove the <span class="emphasis"><em>Special Wizard</em></span> altogether, or add another type, such as an <span class="emphasis"><em>Elemental Wizard</em></span>. In each case, their abilities will change (or be removed) and as a result it will affect the overall dynamics of play, including how other characters will be able to battle against it. Some real-life examples of this are in games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash Royale</em></span>, where adjustments are made on a regular basis in order to balance gameplay.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note120"></a>Note</h3><p>For further reading, check out this link: <a class="ulink" href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance" target="_blank">https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec120"></a>Extending the Unity editor</h3></div></div></div><p>The Unity Editor can actually be extended.

All these scenarios are possible by transforming your game into a multiplayer game, which could be potentially played by many different players over a network.</p><p>Unity offers many built-in functions to for multiplayer games, but they are not as easy as you would expect. But if you have money, there are many third-party plugins to make managing multiplayer games easier.

In fact, in this book, I have provided you with some homework, but often you need to be your own teacher, and force yourself to do homework to improve your skills.</p><p>In doing this, don't forget to learn from those who have preceded us, and have found some methods and techniques, which work great in most cases. In fact, you should learn and develop your own best practices. In the case of Unity, you can start by visiting this link: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BestPracticeGuides.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BestPracticeGuides.html</a>.</p></div></div>
