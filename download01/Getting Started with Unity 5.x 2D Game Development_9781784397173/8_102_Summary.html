From there, we extended the improvements to Unity in general, by providing more areas of game development that we didn't have time to cover in detail, but that need your attention if you wish to improve your own skills.</p><p>During game development, you are often not alone, but you are within a team, and it is important that each part of the team works as if they all were one (like the human body) so to achieve the finest results. As such, some collaboration tools have been highlighted, so that you are free to try them and choose the one that suits your team best.</p><p>Then, we came back to our game, by focusing on optimization and playtesting, which are both wrongly considered as last steps of the game development pipeline, but as we found out, this is not true. The sooner you start iterating on them, the better your game will be. Optimization is needed to run your game efficiently, whereas playtesting is needed to make player's experience smooth.</p><p>We didn't stop there, and we went through what's after the game is completed, and we discussed topics ranging from marketing your game, creating an online presence to publish your game, and hopefully get a revenue out of it. As such, we explored many hints on how to use the most common social media platforms as tools to promote your image and your game by engaging and expand your target audience.</p><p>At the very end, we scratched the surface of localization, just to have a better idea of what's behind that, since we didn't have the time to face it properly, but it was worthy of mention.</p></div>
