But the most important outcome from the rest of the chapter is to understand how to program UI within the framework of Unity.</p><p>First of all, we need to create a Canvas in our scene, and as a consequence, an event system will also be created. You can do it by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> and tweak the options in the Inspector based on your needs. This really depends on your target platform (more on this in the last chapter of this book), and the best way to understand which of these options suit your needs is to test and test and test again.</p><p>The next step is to have a nice background for our interface. We got a really nice blue bar in our package that you can find in the <code class="literal">Graphics/UI</code> folder. In order to place it within our interface, let's create a new image.</p><p>Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span>. We can rename the object <code class="literal">UI_Background</code>. Drag and drop <code class="literal">ui_blue_top_with_text</code> from the project panel into the Sprite variable of the Image component. Since our package is already in proportion with respect to the resolution we decided in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Flat World in Unity</em></span>,Â we can just press the <span class="strong"><strong>Set Native Size</strong></span> button to restore the original ratio. Then, scale the bar and place it as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_03_051.jpg" /></div><p>In the game view, it will look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_03_052.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"></a>Note</h3><p>As for your convenience, the package contains an instance of the UI, which has already placed labels on it. This will allow us to save some time. However, if you want to create your UI, remember to place labels and format them with the right font.</p></div><p>As a result, we have got a place to start developing our UI as we designed it in the previous section.</p></div>
