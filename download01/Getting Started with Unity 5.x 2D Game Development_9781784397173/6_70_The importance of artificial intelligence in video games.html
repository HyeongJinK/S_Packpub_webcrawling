Games like <span class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.simcity.com" target="_blank">www.simcity.com</a>) would cease to exist. Games would become predictable experiences, their replay value would be greatly diminished, and MMOs would become ordinary. It would be the apocalypse of dynamic gameplay, without being too dramatic. Therefore, for any game to provide a dynamic and growing experience, AI is essential.</p><p>Artificial intelligence, or simply AI, allows systems to think and then behave just like humans, <span class="emphasis"><em>or </em></span>animals<span class="emphasis"><em>. </em></span>Over time, these systems can learn from the behavior of its user; for example, if they are progressing too easily, or if they are struggling, then the system is able to make adjustments to the game (in real time) so that the game adapts to the player. This concept refers to <span class="strong"><strong>machine learning</strong></span><span class="emphasis"><em>. </em></span></p><p>AI in computer games refers to the behaviour and decision-making process of game components such as non-player characters, or NPCs for short. In modern games, there is real-time, very dynamic AI that in some cases feels like you're playing against other real players. In this way, well done AI allows you to make fast and intelligent decisions in order to progress through the game and achieve greatness. Some examples of AI in games can range from early arcade games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span>, to enemies in first person shooters, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Battlefield</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Call of Duty</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Alpha Protocol</em></span>; or <span class="emphasis"><em>hordes of orcs</em></span> and beasts in strategy games, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Guild Wars 2</em></span>.</p><p>In a book about AI (<span class="emphasis"><em>Artificial Intelligence for Games</em></span> by Ian Millington and John Funge), which I recommend you to have a look at, we can think of AI as having the following states:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Movement</strong></span>: This refers to AI that involves NPCs making decisions that then produce a type of motion, such as attacking or fleeing the player.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Decision making</strong></span>: As the name suggests, this requires that a decision is made by the NPC about what to do next. For instance, if the enemy sees you, will it attack, run, or call for help?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Strategy</strong></span>: Imagine trying to coordinate a whole team, like in <span class="emphasis"><em>S.W.A.T</em></span> or Tom Clancy's <span class="emphasis"><em>Rainbow Six</em></span>. In these situations, AI does not affect just one or two characters, but the entire team who, in turn, may have his or her own decision making tree, such as what to do when they sight an enemy; do they take them out on their own or do they notify you?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Infrastructure</strong></span>: This refers to how the AI is structured, which will ultimately determine how well it works in a game. This isn't just about creating the write algorithms to make NPCs perform certain actions, it is also about utilizing the computer's resources in an efficient way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Agent-based AI</strong></span>: This refers to the concept of creating autonomous NPCs that take in information from the game data, determine what actions to take, and then carry out those actions.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip91"></a>Tip</h3><p>A great site to check out is Intel's: <a class="ulink" href="http://tinyurl.com/IntelAI" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/IntelAI</a>, which provides a nice explanation and introduction to the use of AI in games.</p></div></div>
