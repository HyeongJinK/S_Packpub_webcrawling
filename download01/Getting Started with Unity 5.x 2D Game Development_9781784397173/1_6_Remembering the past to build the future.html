In fact, you needed to use a range of different methods and tricks to achieve the illusion on 2D. All the 2D objects were actually 3D objects viewed in a particular perspective or with a particular camera, which gave the illusion of a 2D object.</p><p>From Unity 4.6 on, and especially since Unity 5.x, this is not needed any more. There is built-in support for 2D games. So now, there are special components to deal with 2D objects, and the following sections will explore some of them.</p></div>
