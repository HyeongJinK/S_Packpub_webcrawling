Then, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers</em></span>, we implemented the Projectile and Cupcake tower classes. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>, we implemented the health and the sugar of the player, whereas in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone – Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>, we focused on animating our sweet-toothed Panda. Finally, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Secret Ingredient Is a Dash of Physics</em></span>, we explored physics and how we can use it within our game, and in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Through a Sea of Sprinkles – Navigation in Artificial Intelligence</em></span>, we gave the Pandas the possibility of moving along the path towards the sweet cake.</p><p>So, what's left to do is the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Integrate a trading system so the player can buy, sell, and upgrade cupcake towers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a mechanism to place the cupcake towers once they have been bought</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Specify how the player can select a specific cupcake tower</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Set up game over conditions.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keeping track of the progress of the player during gameplay</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implement a spawning system for our Pandas</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a main menu for our game</p></li></ul></div><p>After we have done all of this, we will basically have a functioning game. So, let's get started with the first on the list.</p></div>
