So, before you continue with the next chapter, let's get good at using Prefabs.</p><p>The following two exercises are needed to have the game completed at the end:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Arming the Cupcakes Towers (Part I)</strong></span>:Inside <code class="literal">projectiles_sheet_01</code> in the <code class="literal">Graphics/projectiles</code> folder, there are nine different projectiles; however, we used only one, <code class="literal">Pink_Sprinkle</code>. Create the other eight Prefabs, with meaningful names. Don't forget to attach the projectile script to all of them. Do not worry too much about the values assigned inside the script, such as the damage, since we will see the balance of the game later on in the book. However, do not forget to assign the right <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> value and the proper tag.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Arming the Cupcakes Towers (Part II)</strong></span>: Inside <code class="literal">cupcake_tower_sheet-01</code> in the <code class="literal">Graphics/towers</code> folder, there are three different towers with their respective upgrading levels; however, we only used the sprinkle cupcake tower. Create the other two Prefabs for the chocolate and lemon cupcake towers. Don't forget to attach the cupcake tower script to both of them and assign the respective projectiles and upgrade levels graphic. Again, don't worry much about the values, such as the range radius, because we will see the balance of the game later in the book. However, don't forget to assign the right <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> value.</p><p>The following exercises will help you to improve your skills by familiarizing yourself with best practices:</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Formatting scripts for designers (Part I)</strong></span>: In our scripts, we used many variables. Comments next to them help us to understand their function; however, these comments are hidden to designers. Therefore, it's good practice to add tooltips to show up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. If you want, you can use the text of the comments as parameter for the tooltips.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Formatting scripts for designers (Part II)</strong></span>: Even if our scripts in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> look good, they can be improved if we add some headings before groups of variables. So, assign meaningful headings and reorder the variables to fit in these headings.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Formatting scripts for designers (Part III)</strong></span>: The <code class="literal">direction</code> variable inside the projectile script must be set to public since it is changed from the cupcake tower script. However, it should be visible in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Use attributes to hide it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Formatting scripts for designers (Part IV)</strong></span>: Some variables in our scripts are better to show with a slider rather than a numeric input field, especially those that cannot assume negative numbers. For these, transform their appearance to a slider and don't allow negative values for them.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Best Practices (Part I)</strong></span>: Inside the cupcake tower script there is the <code class="literal">Upgrade Level</code> variable, which is private. However, it might be useful to create a get function to retrieve its value. By following the guidelines in the link shown in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Variables</em></span> section of this chapter, implement the respective get function.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Best Practices (Part II)</strong></span>: Again inside the cupcake tower script, inside the <code class="literal">Upgrade()</code> function, the <code class="literal">GetComponent()</code> function is called to get the <code class="literal">SpriteRenderer</code>. Best practice suggests to call this function only once and store the reference inside a variable. Create a new variable to store the <code class="literal">SpriteRenderer</code> component attached to the cupcake tower game object. Assign its value inside the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function by using the <code class="literal">GetComponent()</code> function. Then, use this variable in the <code class="literal">Upgrade()</code> function to update the graphic of the cupcake tower.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Best Practices (Part III)</strong></span>: We didn't define a tag for the cupcake towers because we don't need to distinguish between them. However, it's good practice to assign a tag to them. This is because it might be needed later on when we would like to extend our game (for example, enemies that try to avoid cupcake towers within their limits). Therefore, create a new cupcake tower tag and assign it to all the cupcake tower Prefabs (there should be three, also counting the one created in the first exercise of this section).</p></li></ol></div></div>
