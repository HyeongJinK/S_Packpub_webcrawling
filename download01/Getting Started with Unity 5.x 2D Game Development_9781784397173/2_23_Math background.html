We don't have time to go through all the math behind this game, since it is required to have a complete toolset for game development. However, this section introduces you to some basic concepts that we will need for the rest of the book. In addition, it also makes some references to the official documentation so that you can learn a bit more about it.</p><p>If you feel confident with some of the following topics, you are free to skip them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Vectors</strong></span>: They are really important in game development, because they are able to describe spaces (both 3D and 2D). They can represent a position or a direction. You can read more about them at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VectorCookbook.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VectorCookbook.html</a> and watch this video: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/vector-maths" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/vector-maths</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Probability</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>: </strong></span>This is very important when we want a sample to emerge from our game, by including uncertainty and chances for the player. A common example is in RTS or MMORPG games, where the amount of damage is often between a range (determined by the character's stat), but the actual and real amount of damage uses random numbers. Another case is when an attack should be critical so to inflict double the damage. At the end of the chapter it is explained how to extract random numbers in Unity. However, consider buying a proper math book about probability; it might be worthwhile.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Radians and Degrees</strong></span>: Angles can have two unit of measurements. Radians are usually used to perform calculations, but Unity has some constants that by a multiplication can convert one to the other representation. You can read more about these at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Deg2Rad.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Deg2Rad.html</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Rad2Deg.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Rad2Deg.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Trigonometry</strong></span>: This is really important, because the sine and the cosine functions are often used to achieve believable behavior, since Mother Nature uses them for our world. Unluckily, there are no shortcuts. Therefore, if you really want to understand them and get into them, you should read any book about trigonometry. However, the most important notion used is that they range the value of their arguments between <code class="literal">-1</code> and <code class="literal">+1</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Quaternions</strong></span>: This is a math entity that's not very intuitive, since it involves the analysis of complex numbers. However, it's not important to know them in detail (except in really specific cases) when programming in Unity. In fact, it's enough to know that Unity uses them to store rotations. Also, there are functions to convert from the Euler representations (the most intuitive of three angles). The reason of this choice is behind the scope of this book, but it's due a numerical instability of the Euler representation. You can learn more about them by watching the following video: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/quaternions" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/quaternions</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Atan2()</strong></span>: This is a function that is really important in game development, because it is able to calculate the angle of a vector. You can read more about this function at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Atan2.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Atan2.html</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div>
