For example, when you are walking, typing, drinking, eating, any kind of movement, do it in slow motion. What you begin to notice is how subtle movements can make animations distinct and give it character. For each animation, such as drinking a glass of water for instance, do it in a different way. Pick up the cup, perhaps with a different grip such as using your whole hand or a few fingers around the handle. As you begin to become more conscious about movement, you should be able to gain some insight into how you might need to adjust an animation in Unity when something doesn't quite feel right. To get a better idea again, search for videos, even books to explore the uses of animation and some of their underpinnings. While this book is in no way a how to on animation, understanding the fundamentals not only help you to improve your own understanding about animations, but also help you to better understand the role of an animator and what it entails. This kind of information will be valuable to you later if you ever work or need to work with an animator.</p></div>
