In doing this, we will explore another big topic: <span class="strong"><strong>gameplay programming</strong></span>. In particular, we will see how data can be exchanged between different parts of a game. Since in our tower defense game there are still many parts to connect, and they can be implemented in thousands of different ways, I tried to choose different techniques in order to give you a different perspective on how things can be implemented within Unity.</p><p>Specifically, in this chapter we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to implement a trading system to allow the player to buy, sell, and upgrade cupcake towers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scripting how the player can place cupcake towers on the map once they are bought</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How game over conditions can be triggered to display a winning or losing screen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keeping track of the progress made by the player during the level</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a spawn system for our Pandas, based on dividing the Pandas into waves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing and implementing a main menu</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to change a scene in Unity</p></li></ul></div><p>As always, at the end of the chapter you can find the <span class="emphasis"><em>Homework</em></span> section, which is full of exercises for you to bring your skills to a higher level. Some of these exercises will challenge you about the concepts learnt in the chapter, and they will guide you in improving our tower defense game.</p><p>But before we go straight into gameplay programming for our game, let's spend some time learning about gameplay programming in general.</p></div>
