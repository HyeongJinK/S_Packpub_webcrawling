Many developers think that publishing only in English should be enough because it is understood by most gamers. However, if you give a look to the marketing and downloading graphs, it's clear that English is just 20% of the market. Therefore, you should definitely take into consideration localizing your game to other audiences.</p><p>But localization is much more than just translating your game and/or adding subtitles in other languages. There are so many things you should keep in consideration. Some of the many reasons are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In some languages, like German, some words are really long and they might be cut off or overflow from your user interface.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Some languages, such as Arabic are written in a different direction, for instance, right to left or up to down. Thus, you may have to adjust the design of your UI to support the visual impact that your interface will have.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In case you have dialogue systems, or just the user interface that uses string concatenation in a certain way within the code, be aware than in other languages, they need to be rewritten if they are not flexible enough! An example would be when you want to place an adjective before the word. In some other languages, it might happen in the opposite direction. For instance, the English sentence the <span class="emphasis"><em>red hat</em></span> becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>il cappello rosso</em></span> in Italian, where <span class="emphasis"><em>rosso</em></span> means red. Thus, the adjective is after the word and not before it, unlike in English. Another (practical) example is the following: you reserve an extra character at the end of your item to add an <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> to make it plural (<span class="emphasis"><em>potion</em></span> can become <span class="emphasis"><em>potions</em></span>). In Italian, you don't need an extra character but change the last one (<span class="emphasis"><em>pozione</em></span> becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>pozioni</em></span> in the plural form). Moreover, in Italian the last character that changes depends on whether the object is female or male (a concept that doesn't exist in English, since objects don't have any sex). Therefore, your solution to reserve a character is not structured enough to support Italian. Imagine applying this to all the other languages, and you quickly realize that it's not so easy to localize you game by just adding a couple of variables.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In some cultures, the role of the <span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> and of the <span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span> is inverted within numbers (For example the number 3,218 can be interpreted as three thousand two hundred eighteen or also as three point two one eight, such as in Italy).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In some cultures, specific concepts might be not well tolerated, and therefore they should be censured or removed. This is typically with violent games or games that contain certain types of adult content.</p></li></ul></div><p>All of these problems should be taken into consideration when you translate because it's not as straightforward as getting the translation of your text. Here is a list of examples, by no means exhaustive:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Translators need to have the context of the game, because in other languages, many shades are lost with direct translation, and in some way, they should be kept when possible</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Biographies of characters are useful in case your collaborators do voice casting for other languages</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Some metaphors or sayings may have no meaning in other languages</p></li></ul></div><p>As such, you should consider localization from the very beginning of your development flow. However, this is often not possible due time and economic constraints. In any case, keep in mind that the sooner you pay attention to localization, the easier it will be in the long run.</p></div>
