In particular, the ability to walk/navigate through the map towards the player's cake to eat it. In fact, as we have already pointed out, <span class="strong"><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>) is at the core of giving life to NPCs, so that they can move around and act within the world. However, this chapter will focus on navigation.</p><p>In particular, we will implement a waypoint system for our Pandas. We will do it twice, so that we can have two different perspectives on the same thing, and we will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each method.</p><p>Here is an outline of the topics that we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The importance of AI in video games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Navigation in video games and an overview of the main techniques</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing a waypoint system as a static list</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing a waypoint system as a dynamic pool of game objects (and display them as icons on the map)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Getting an idea of what's beyond navigation</p></li></ul></div><p>As in all the other chapters of this book, you can practice your skill at the end with the Homework section.
