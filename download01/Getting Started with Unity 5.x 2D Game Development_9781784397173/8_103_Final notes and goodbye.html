Time flew, and I just realized that I filled up a whole book!</p><p>I really want to thank you all, the readers whom I didn't have a chance to meet in person. But when I was writing the words of this book until very late at night, I felt connected to all of you in some way. For me, this has been an amazing travel too (although at sometimes tiring and stressful).</p><p>In case you have illegally downloaded this book but you really liked it, please consider buying it.
