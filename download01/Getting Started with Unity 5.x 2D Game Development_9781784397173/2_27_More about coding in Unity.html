These are topics related with C# more than with Unity, but they are important if you want to become a good game developer. Next, you can find a very brief explanation, but I recommend that you learn them properly from a C# book.</p><p>Finally, there is probability, which is a topic of math, as we discussed previously, and it is essential in game development. However, once you know the basics of probability, you should be able to generate random numbers in Unity.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>Static variables</h3></div></div></div><p>Some classes (or components, in the case of Unity), contain variables, which eventually can be set in the Inspector or changed at runtime. However, the whole class can share a variable among all its instances. Such variables are referred to as static variables and are declared with the <code class="literal">static</code> keyword. A common use is to share a reference to another component, which all the instances of the class should refer to. We will see this better later in the book, when we will use static variables</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Inheritance</h3></div></div></div><p>If different classes share many features in common, we could give them an inheritance structure. This means, to have a parent class that holds the general and common features between these classes, and then they are implemented as children of the parent. A common example to clarify this is imagining the classes Fruit, Apple, and Banana. Fruit is the parent class, which holds all the properties of being a fruit (such as that it is edible), and the children share the same feature of the parent (since both an Apple and a Banana are fruits, and therefore edible). Then, they can implement the specific features of that fruit. For instance, the Apple is red, whereas the Banana is yellow.</p><p>Sometimes, the parent class can also have functions (such as <code class="literal">Eat()</code>) which all the children can give their own implementation. This leads to the difference between the abstract and virtual methods.</p><p>Abstract methods are so abstract that the parent class cannot give an implementation of it, but its children have to. Virtual methods, instead, can be implemented in the parent class, since it offers general functionality, but children can override it to give a better implementation of it.</p><p>We will look at inheritance in more detail, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Trading Cupcakes and the Ultimate Battle for the Cake - Gameplay Programming</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Random numbers in Unity</h3></div></div></div><p>Generating random numbers in Unity is easy since Unity provides the class <code class="literal">Random</code>, which allows us to generate random numbers. The most used function of this class is <code class="literal">Range()</code>, which generates a random number between a min and a max value. Here is an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Generates a random number between 2 and 30</em></span> &#13;
Random.Range(2, 30); &#13;
