<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec55"></a>Physics – basics</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In this section, we will learn some basic notions of physics, to better understand the Physics engine of Unity later on, and overall become better game developers.</p><p>First of all, what is physics? Aristotle (the same guy from the previous chapter) wrote a treatise entitled <span class="emphasis"><em>ta physika</em></span>, which literally means the natural things. From this treatise (although many before Aristotle have written about natural phenomena), physics has become a science. Nowadays, physics investigates matter, its motion both in time and space, through mathematical models. Ultimately, the goal of physics is to describe how the whole universe works. Physics is divided into four big branches:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Classical mechanics</strong></span>: This deals with the motion of objects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Thermodynamics</strong></span>: This deals with the temperatures of bodies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Electromagnetism</strong></span>: This deals with electromagnetic waves/particles</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Quantum mechanics</strong></span>: This deals with the study of subatomic particles</p></li></ul></div><p>You don't need to see these as separate entities but just faces of the same coin, which is the model of the world that physics over the centuries has tried to unravel. Therefore, many topics cross them all, and so the division in not univocal. But, it's a good way for newcomers to physics to get an overview.</p><p>In this chapter, we will deal only with classical mechanics, and in particular with the motion of rigid bodies. However, other branches and sub-branches of physics are also really useful in game development. For instance, we can use light equations, which are implemented in shader, or fluid dynamics to simulate oceans and waves. Even when the evil wizard casts his most terrible fireball, we need to calculate many different physics equations to have a realistic behaviour and look. Imagine just simulating the fire around the ball.</p><p>Most of the time, you don't want to go into that much detail, if you already have a game engine like Unity (or Unreal). In fact, their programmers will take care of this for you. However, sometimes you may have special needs, and you need to write your own shader or code some physics-based behaviours. As such, knowledge of physics is greatly and immensely helpful.</p><p>Of course, this is not a course in physics nor a book dedicated to physics programming (for example, algorithms that can simulate more or less approximately and efficiently some physical behaviours). However, in this chapter, we will consolidate the really basic concepts of physics so that we can have a rough idea of how it all works together. As such, this and the upcoming sections will be dedicated to building a foundational understanding of physics so that we can better grasp the Physics engine behind Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note55"></a>Note</h3><p>I know that some of you might find physics somewhat boring. This may be the case if it awakes some bad memory (or memories) from high school. But my personal opinion is that knowing physics is really important to be a good game developer, especially when you need to program realistic behaviours. With this said, I promise that in this section, I'll try to be as clear as possible and use an informal language instead of the strict mathematical one so that these concepts can be understood by anyone.</p></div><p>Classical mechanics of rigidbodies can be divided into two sub-branches:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Kinematics: Which deals with the study of the motion.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dynamics: Which deals with the causes of the motion.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, once again, they are faces of the same coin. In fact, dynamic equations need kinematic ones, so as to describe and predict the motion of rigidbodies. We will see them in a bit more detail soon, but first let's focus on some basic concepts.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec48"></a>World coordinates and local coordinates</h3></div></div></div><p>As we have already seen in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers,</em></span> there is a difference in using world coordinates and local coordinates. This is also an important concept in physics: which one is your reference frame (or coordinate system)? The question is key in determining also the values of the different physics quantities. Therefore, every time you have a physical quantity, you need to ask yourself in which reference frame are you working.</p><p>In any case, there isn't a frame that is privileged with respect to another (although some physical systems are easier to describe within a frame instead of another). So, by convention, a world frame is defined when we start the description of a physical system. For example, if you are driving your car, what is your velocity? Well, the answer depends on the coordinate system, or reference frame in which I'm describing the car moving. In the car itself, the speed of the car is zero, but rather the world is coming towards the car. Whereas for a pedestrian, the car is moving, and the world is not. An astronaut on the moon will see both the pedestrian moving really fast, along with the whole Earth, and also the car, at two different speeds. All of these descriptions are physically correct. Therefore, all quantities in physics depends on the reference frame.</p><p>In game engines such as Unity and/or Unreal, there is always a defined world frame (when you have the position with all zeros at the center of the world frame) as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_002.jpg" /></div><p>The preceding diagram shows how other frames are described in terms of linear and angular offset from the world frame. Moreover, you can describe a frame in terms of another, which is not the world frame (in the preceding diagram, look at the angular offset of frame <span class="strong"><strong>#3</strong></span>). In Unity, you can consider the world frame as the global coordinates and the different frames as the local coordinates of game objects in the game. Children of game objects will be expressed in terms of the frame of the parent.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec49"></a>Velocity</h3></div></div></div><p>Velocity in physics describes a relation between the space and the time of an object; in other words, how the object changes position with respect to a reference frame as a function of time. When the object is not accelerating, velocity is defined as distance covered in space divided by time.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note56"></a>Note</h3><p>For those of you who are curious, when an object changes its velocity in each instant, and we need to get the velocity in a specific instant, it is possible to retrieve it by using derivatives (this is a topic of calculus, and I won't adventure deeper in this book).</p></div><p>Velocity is a vector, and therefore it has two coordinates in the 2D world (three in the 3D world), which express a direction and an intensity. The intensity of a velocity is also called <span class="strong"><strong>speed</strong></span>. So it's important to not get confused between the two. In fact, speed is a scalar, just a number, acting independently if we are dealing with 2D or 3D games; velocity, instead, does change (from two numbers to three numbers to express respectively the 2D or 3D vector).</p><p>Whenever we use the term velocity, we mean the velocity in the defined world frame (or coordinate). When we use the term relative velocity, we are taking the velocity with respect to another frame. For instance, imagine that there are two cars that are heading against each other, both at 50 Km/h (in the world frame, because when you look at your tachymeter, by convention, that is the velocity with respect to the Earth). For one of the two drivers, the car he is driving is not moving (in fact, when you drive, your steering wheel is not going 50 Km/h away from your hands, but it is always at the same distance from you). However, he will see the other car with the other driver coming at 100 Km/h towards him.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec50"></a>Mass</h3></div></div></div><p>In classical mechanics, every rigid body has a mass, which you can imagine as the amount of matter that forms that body. Thus, it is considered a property of the physical body. Often in spoken language, mass is confused with weight. In fact, mass is measured in kg (kilograms) in the International System of Units, whereas weight is measured in N (newton) in the International System of Units. Therefore, a scale is not measuring your weight, but rather your mass. Weight is a force and depends on the location where you are. Your weight is different on the moon, but your mass is the same.</p><p>Sometimes, mass is also defined as the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a force is applied. In fact, you need much more force to move a truck than your laptop.</p><p>However, it is worthwhile paying attention that, for instance, both the laptop and the truck (in absence of other external forces) are attracted by the gravity of the Earth and that both will fall down and touch the ground at the same time. In fact, when the universal gravitation equation of Newton is applied, the forces applied are different but the resulting gravitational acceleration is the same for both objects (since the mass is simplified from the equations).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"></a>Note</h3><p>For the more curious of you, this was discovered by the famous Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician Galileo Galilei, much before Newton formalized gravitation. There is an anecdote in which Galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. In this way, he proved that Aristotle's idea that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight (at that time intended as mass) was wrong as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_003.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec55"></a>Centre of mass</h4></div></div></div><p>Imagine you need to calculate or predict the trajectory of an arrow. Taking into consideration the whole shape of the arrow and knowing that different forces come into play at each point ends up in a really tricky calculation (although possible). Therefore, the center of mass is an approximation that works pretty well for rigid bodies. It consists of concentrating the whole mass of an object into a single point (which is an abstraction to imagine all of the mass of that body in that single point). Where this point is depends on the shape of the object (since it is weighted among all the points the object is composed of), and this carries enough information about the shape to do really precise calculations. Especially in real-time applications, this becomes critical, since calculations of motion are greatly simplified. In fact, Unity will only do calculations using the center of mass.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_004.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The center of mass is the weight average of all the points in the system, where the weights are the different masses. From the diagram, we can see that center of mass is closer to m1 and m3, since they are bigger (have more mass) than m2.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec51"></a>Kinematics</h3></div></div></div><p>The term kinematics was used for the first time around 1840, as the translation of the French term <span class="emphasis"><em>cinématique</em></span>, which was used by <span class="emphasis"><em>André-Marie Ampère</em></span> (the famous French physicist and one of the founders of classical electromagnetism — so famous that the electric current unit in the International System of Units, the ampere, was named after him). However, the origin of the term derives from the Greek word <span class="emphasis"><em>kinesis</em></span>, which means movement or motion.</p><p>To have a better understanding of what kinematics is in physics, let's refer to Wikipedia:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points (alternatively particles), bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without consideration of the masses of those objects nor the forces that may have caused the motion. Kinematics as a field of study is often referred to as the geometry of motion."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Kinematics takes into consideration just the motion of an object and not the causes of the motion. This gives us some advantages when it comes to game development. First of all, it is cheaper from a computational point of view to take into consideration just the kinematics of an object. Then, we might not want to have a fully realistic object in our scene, and so we can just define its kinematic properties. We will see this in detail later when we will deal with kinematic bodies in Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note58"></a>Note</h3><p>Of course, in our world, a pure kinematic body doesn't exist; all of them are dynamic. Yet, studying just the kinematics of an object gives us insights into its motion.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec52"></a>Dynamics</h3></div></div></div><p>The term dynamic was used in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in the meaning of pertaining to the force producing motion, as opposite to static. Once again, it takes its origin from the French term <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamique</em></span>, although it was introduced by the famous German mathematician and philosopher, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz. However, the origin of this term is again from the Greek word <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamikos</em></span>, which means powerful, and also from <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamis</em></span> (power) and <span class="emphasis"><em>dynasthai</em></span> (to be able to, to have power, and to be strong enough).</p><p>If not already explicitly suggested, every time we deal with something dynamic in physics, we are dealing with forces (which have a certain power to move objects). From Wikipedia we can read:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Dynamics is a branch of applied mathematics (specifically classical mechanics) concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion, as opposed to kinematics, which studies the motion of objects without reference to its causes. Isaac Newton defined the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics, especially his second law of motion."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Therefore, dynamics is built on top of kinematics and gives a better description/prediction of how the body will move. In fact, by taking forces into consideration, mass, gravity, drag, and many other things become really important and relevant.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec53"></a>Force and torque</h3></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
<span class="emphasis"><em>"Forces are those things that allow motion; they are responsible for creating a motion</em></span>."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Every force applies an acceleration to a body, which is calculated with Newton's second law. It is so simple and elegant that it's easy to understand. We can see this law as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_005.jpg" /></div><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> represents the force, which is a vector (so the arrow above the formula), <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span> is the mass, and <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> is the acceleration, which is another vector (so the arrow above its symbol in the formula).</p><p>This means that if you apply a force to an object with mass <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span>, you know that the acceleration is <span class="emphasis"><em>F/m</em></span>. So, just divide the force by the mass of an object and you can calculate how much it will be accelerated. Please note that if we have two objects on which we apply the same force but they have two different masses, the one with the higher mass will have a lower acceleration, because the force is divided by a greater number.</p><p>The concept of force is important because it is the cause of motion, and many Physics engines (including the one of Unity) allow you to specify forces.</p><p>Another important concept is torque, also called moment of force or just moment, which in some way expresses a force that makes an object rotate along an axis instead of moving it. If you think of force like a pull or push, you can imagine torque as a twist.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note59"></a>Note</h3><p>To those of you who know a bit more about the cross-product of vectors, torque is defined as the cross-product between the force vector and the distance vector from the application point of the force. As a result, it tends to produce rotational motion. Therefore, the formula is:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_006.jpg" /></div><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>τ</em></span> (read tau) is the torque, <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> is the force vector, and <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> is the distance vector, also called offset.</p><p>In the the International System of Units, torque is measured in <span class="emphasis"><em>N·m</em></span> (Newton meter).</p></div><p>The formula of torque is a bit more complicated since it involves the cross-product, and one who has just started to deal with physics in video games and uses a graphics engine like Unity doesn't need to know/understand the formula straightaway. However, it is important to understand that this quantity deals with rotations, and applying a torque on a rigid body means that it will rotate along an axis depending on where the torque is applied. Just remember that torque is not a force, although it might seem so due to the way we will deal with it within Unity.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec54"></a>Collisions</h3></div></div></div><p>In classical mechanics, there are different kinds of collisions between rigid bodies that may happen. They are divided into two categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Elastic collisions, in which all the kinetic energy is conserved.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Inelastic collisions, in which part of the kinetic energy is transformed into another form of energy.</p></li></ul></div><p>To go through this chapter, it's not important to understand them well, but it is important to understand that the type of collision may change the behaviour of what happens after the collision. Imagine two balls: one rolling towards the second, which is not moving. At a certain point, the first one will collide with the second. Depending on which kind of collision happens, the result may differ. In one scenario, both the balls will roll in the same direction and they will be as if they were attached. In another scenario, the first one stops and the second one starts to roll. In a third scenario they roll at different velocities and directions after the collision.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_007.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The three possible after-collision scenarios</p></div></div><p>If you want to learn more, a web page that explains the basic concepts of different collisions in a quite simple way is <a class="ulink" href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html</a>. However, it is intended for those who already have a clear knowledge of the basic concepts and formulae of physics.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note60"></a>Note</h3><p>The website itself, <a class="ulink" href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu</a>, is a good source for quick references to the main concepts of physics. However, a minimum of prerequisites are needed to fully understand what's on it. The best way to start is always with a physics book, which may be boring, but mastering those concepts is a great advantage.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"></a>Rigid body</h3></div></div></div><p>A rigid body, as the name suggests, is a body that translates and rotates all together. So for instance, a Christmas ball, a television, or a flying disk are rigid bodies, because all their parts move together. A laptop is not, because its lid can rotate, as well as a door if you consider the frame too as a part of the whole. But, these kinds of objects can be described with two different rigid bodies, such as the door-frame and the door itself, which may constrain each other (in this case with a Hinge). Water, air, toothpaste, or a dress are not considered rigid bodies, because all their parts don't move together.</p><p>Most of the objects in your game will be rigidbodies (I'm writing it attached because this is the way Unity will refer to them), or they can be approximated to rigidbodies, so knowing them well is key to learning physics in Unity. In fact, most of the 2D Physics engine of unity is focused on rigid bodies (as we will see soon), and therefore this chapter is about them.</p><p>Simulating clothes, liquids, and other physical entities that are not rigidbodies is generally harder, although possible. But often they are used in 3D games, and we won't deal these aspects in this chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note61"></a>Note</h3><p>For the most curious of you, here is a more precise definition:
 A <span class="strong"><strong>rigid body</strong></span> is the idealization of a solid body, where deformation is neglected. Therefore, the distance between any two points within the rigid body remains constant over time, independently of the forces that will apply on the rigid body.</p><p>Of course, in our world such objects don't exist. In fact they are idealizations, but they approximate the behaviour of solid objects pretty well (unless the speed of an object is near the speed of light).</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec56"></a>Friction – linear and angular drag</h3></div></div></div><p>If a kid were to ask me, "what is friction?" I would reply, "friction is the thing without which all things wouldn't stop moving". Even if this is not a formal definition, it helps to understand what friction is. It comes into play when you consider the dynamics of an object, because friction generates a force that opposes to the motion of the physical body. There are many types of frictions and they depend on different factors. For instance, air drag depends on the velocity of an object, whereas dry friction depends on the normal force (which depends on the surface, position of an object, its weight, and therefore also its mass).</p><p>In games, except for specific needs, you don't need all these kinds of frictions and drags. For instance, in Unity you can control just the linear and the angular drag. The first one opposes the motion of an object along a trajectory (or better, the trajectory of the center of mass of the object; otherwise it would be too complicated to do in real time) and the angular to the rotation of an object. So, in Unity, an object that has both nonzero values for linear and angular drag will eventually stop moving and rotating (in the absence of other forces).</p></div></div>
