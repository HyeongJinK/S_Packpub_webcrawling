However, at the end of this chapter we will continue our tower defense game from where we left it in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone – Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>. Therefore, if you want to keep developing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tower Defense</em></span> game, you need to have done all the other steps in the previous chapters.</p><p>For those of you who are newcomers to physics, a great deal of patience is required, but once you master these concepts, a world of new possibilities for your own games will open. So don't give up!</p></div>
