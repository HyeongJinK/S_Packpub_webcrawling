Usually, the game provides information, status, or stats of the game and the player interacts with the game with input through the UI.</p><p>This chapter will explain why UIs play such an important role in games and about the different things that we need to take into consideration when we design and/or implement UIs. Of course, this chapter will focus on the Unity framework to build UIs, and explains how to use it.</p><p>In the last part of the chapter, we will see how to start with UI programming from a practical point of view by implementing two important game play elements within the UI of our game. However, we will see more about UI programming in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Secret Ingredient Is a Dash of Physics</em></span>, where we will polish the game and implement the whole gameplay based on the elements built in the previous chapters.</p><p>Lastly, you should definitely consider buying a book that is specifically about UI. Before writing this book, I wrote another book year: <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity UI Cookbook</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt publishing</em></span>. It has a perfect set of recipes ready to use. There you will find all the concepts mentioned here and much more, such as different tips and tricks. You can find it at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-ui-cookbook" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-ui-cookbook</a>.</p><p>Therefore, in this chapter, we will learn how the UIs are designed and how to implement them in Unity:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing UIs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understanding the Unity framework to build UIs by looking in detail at each of its components</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Manipulating and placing UI elements</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing the UI for our tower defense game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing a health bar within our game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing a sugar meter within our game</p></li></ul></div><p>Like all the other chapters of this book, you will find the <span class="emphasis"><em>Homework</em></span> section at the end. It has a range of different exercises for you to do to improve your skills and implement a range of different functionalities into your game. So, let's get ready to learn a lot about UIs.</p></div>
