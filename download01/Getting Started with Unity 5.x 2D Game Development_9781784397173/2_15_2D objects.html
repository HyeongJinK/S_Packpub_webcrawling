However, we didn't mention how to import them into the scene.</p><p>The easiest way to bring your Sprites into the scene is to drag and drop them from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene view</strong></span>. Unity will automatically create a new game object with the same name of the Sprite along with a Sprite Renderer attached. We have already covered this component in the previous chapter. Since we will not use Sorting Layers (as we decided in the previous chapter), we don't need to change any settings when dragging a new Sprite into the scene.</p><p>Another way to add Sprites to the scene is by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then <span class="strong"><strong>2D Object | Sprite</strong></span>. However, in the Sprite Renderer, you need to specify which Sprite to use.</p><p>Let's bring the <code class="literal">Pink_Sprinkle</code> Sprite into our scene (you can find it in the <code class="literal">Graphics/projectiles</code> folder within the <code class="literal">projectiles_sheet_01</code> file). It appears like this in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_001.jpg" /></div><p>Since Sprites are also GameObjects, you can have access to their <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> properties, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_002.jpg" /></div><p>This means that you can change their position along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis and the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis, as well as the scale and the rotation. Remember that the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis is used to determine the depth, as we discussed in the previous chapter.</p><p>By using the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> parameter, it is possible to flip the Sprite. However, keep in mind that this will also flip its children. As we saw in the previous chapter, from Unity 5.3 to flip a Sprite it is preferable to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Flip</strong></span> variable on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>You can create an empty game object by navigating to the top bar menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject | Create Empty</strong></span>. Alternatively, on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>, then select <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span>. Creating an empty game object is a very useful when we need to create containers of other game objects, or if we want to build our game object from scratch.</p></div></div>
