In the following sections, we will go through a number of considerations, both with your team and final product, to ensure that the final part of this process is as smooth as possible.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec136"></a>Crowdfunding campaigns</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a number of different platforms for crowdfunding campaigns and each has its own features. However, the fundamental thing about them all is that they are there to provide a place for you to gather a following and importantly the much-needed funds or you to bring your creation to light. Different crowdfunding platforms operate for different reasons. For example, some are about causes (nature, human rights, or poverty), certain types of products (clothing, music), creative (products or virtual goods), and personal (medical treatments). Your game may meet criteria on more than one, specifically for creative projects, so it is recommended that you spend some time to see where your game is likely to reach those who will be the most interested in it.</p><p>Crowdfunding platforms work by the developer (or creator of any product or idea) presenting their idea, what they need the funding for, how it will be allocated, and what's in it for the backers who will be the ones that ultimately will give you money. In general, backers for your product (in this case, game) will be offered by you, with varying levels of backing opportunities to choose from. For example, if a backer contributes $1 then they are able to have their name listed in the credits on the game's website, or even in-game. If they give you $50, then they are able to get a signed copy of your game, $800 will get them two copies and a handwritten thank-you note, and so on. Be careful when you're setting the amounts for each level. Too much and you won't get backers; too little and you will ruin your budget. One last thing to consider is that in some cases, the crowdfunding platform will not only take a certain percentage from the total amount of funds that you raise, but will also add a fee to your backer's contributions.</p><p>Therefore, before you decide on a crowdfunding platform make sure that it will be the right one for you and for the funds that you are wanting to raise.</p><p>One of the most important things is to keep the risks of your project (both if it is funded and isn't) in mind. There are many risks that can occur, especially when you do get funded that the funds are managed properly and for what they were intended for. You want to have a budget that has been planned well and takes into account likely events that may occur (delays, unexpected costs for hardware, and additional help).</p><p>We have barely scratched the surface of what it means to develop and run a crowdfunding platform, but it is not a task for the faint-hearted. A great deal of thought is required when you're determining the levels of rewards for your backers and you must their cost into consideration and whether or not that will impact your budget. For example, digital downloads of your games will definitely be more cost-effective than burning them to a disc, and housing them in a beautifully decorated case, and then shipping them where they need to go. You can either include the cost of postage in the amount that backers are required to pay or ask it to be paid separately. In any event, crowdfunding campaigns require a lot of time and effort to be run successfully. In addition, they are not always a sure way to get funding, so keep this in mind when you're planning your game and its future.</p><p>Here is a list of crowdfunding sites to check out:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fig: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fig.co" target="_blank">www.fig.co</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Kickstarter: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">www.kickstarter.com</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Indiegogo: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.indiegogo.com" target="_blank">www.indiegogo.com</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>RocketHub: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rockethub.com" target="_blank">www.rockethub.com</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>GoFundMe: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gofundme.com" target="_blank">www.gofundme.com</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Razoo: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.razoo.com" target="_blank">www.razoo.com</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>CrowdRise: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.crowdrise.com" target="_blank">www.crowdrise.com</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec137"></a>Building in Unity</h3></div></div></div><p>The first thing to do is to actually compile the game. Otherwise, you won't be able to put it anywhere!</p><p>To build a game in Unity, you need to navigate in the top bar menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>File | Build Settings…</strong></span>. There, you have the following screen, where you can choose the platform you want to target (and the scenes you want to include):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_034.jpg" /></div><p>If you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings…</strong></span> button, you will go into specific options for your build. Here you can find more information about it: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html</a>.</p><p>Once you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span>, Unity will actually build the game and you can take a breath (and a break). But here, it's just the beginning of the second stage, in which you actually need to publish and market the game!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec138"></a>Clearing the air</h3></div></div></div><p>You're getting excited, you're almost at the finished line, but it is imperative at this point to ensure that everyone, and I mean everyone who is involved, is aware of what will happen next. More importantly, make sure that everyone has been accounted for. For example, how the profits/royalties will be divided, their responsibilities post game launch, and so forth. Of course, this would have been outlined in a contract early on in the project, which they would have signed, but we are all guilty of agreeing to terms and conditions without having actually read them. It might even be worthwhile at this stage to remind everyone to revisit their contract.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec139"></a>Accepting terms and conditions</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that your team are all good to go, you need to make sure that what you're about to put out there for the world to enjoy also abides by the terms and conditions of the platform that you will be targeting. For example, if you are planning to release for Android devices, ensure that you have met their terms and conditions; the same goes for Apple's App Store and any others that you are intending to publish on.</p></div></div>
