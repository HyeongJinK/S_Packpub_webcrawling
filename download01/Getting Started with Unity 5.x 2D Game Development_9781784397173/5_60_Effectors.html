In this case, while the hero is within this room, gravity should be contrasted by a (magical) force.

The box doesn't sink at the same velocity as it falls; moreover, it might float.

Effectors are some components that affect the behaviour of rigidbodies in certain region of the game world. They are really different from each other, because they do different things, although the core concept is the same: they affect one or more rigidbodies that come into the region that they control.</p><p>Effectors use collision detection to know which are the rigidbodies within their region, and therefore, as we already mentioned before, the rigidbodies need to have a collider. Otherwise, they won't be affected by the effector.</p><p>Moreover, the effectors themselves need their own collider to work. This, in order to be used by the effector they should have the <span class="strong"><strong>Used By Effector</strong></span> property set to true. Otherwise, the effector will not affect any rigidbody. If the collider of the effector should be set to be the trigger or not depends both on the kind of effector and on what are you trying to achieve, although there is a default way to set it (in fact, Unity gives you a warning in case you are using the effector in an unusual way).</p><p>We will see this case by case, and here is a summary table with the effectors, saying whether the collider should use <span class="strong"><strong>is Trigger</strong></span> or not:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; ">

Once again, remember that you can learn how to add layers in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>BakingÂ Cupcake Towers

So, in this variable, you can specify one of them through the use of a drop-down menu.</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's see each one of them in detail to better understand how they work.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec66"></a>Constant Force 2D</h3></div></div></div><p>This is not a proper effector, because instead of acting in an area or region, it is directly applied onto a rigidbody. So it needs to be attached to the same game object that has the rigidbody component.</p><p>Here is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_043.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note81"></a>Note</h3><p>Out of curiosity, for this component, there is a 3D counterpart: <span class="strong"><strong>Constant Force</strong></span>.</p></div><p>As the name suggests, it applies a constant force to the rigidbody. Usually this is used in testing to easily apply a force from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, but it can also be used in the normal gameplay if we need an object that is always under the control of a constant force (so that it will keep pushing). Of course, it's value can be changed through script to make it a non-constant force, but in that case it is preferable to apply the force directly with a function in the script. The component should be used only for constant forces or forces that don't change over time (the force can change, but for long periods of time it remains constant).</p><p>Moreover, this component also can be used to apply a torque on the rigidbody.</p><p>Here are the three variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Force</strong></span>: The constant force to apply to the rigidbody.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Relative Force</strong></span>: The constant force to apply to the rigidbody expressed with respect to the rigidbody coordinates</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Torque</strong></span>: The constant torque to apply to the rigidbody</p></li></ul></div><p>Here is an example of usage that is not testing. Suppose you are doing a game where different objects are affected by different gravitational forces. So for instance, brown boxes will follow on the ground as usual, but green boxes will follow on the right because as per your game design they are supposed to do so. The reason could be an experimental serum invented to change gravity for things that are green. In this scenario, the green boxes cannot be affected by normal gravity, so you can place on them a rigidbody and set <span class="strong"><strong>Gravity Scale</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code>. In this way, it won't be affected by normal gravity. Then, place on it the <span class="strong"><strong>Constant 2D</strong></span> force component and set your gravity. Moreover, if all the objects have different <span class="strong"><strong>Constant 2D</strong></span> forces, you can change their gravity force in real time, maybe after the invention of another serum, which changes the gravity on the left instead of the right.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec67"></a>Area Effector 2D</h3></div></div></div><p>This component defines an area within which a force is applied to all the rigidbodies inside the area.

Suppose that there is a special device which is able to push the magnetic shoes of the main character to contrast gravity. So, in the area just above this device, you can place an area effector, specifying a force that goes upwards. Please note that if the intensity of the force is less than the gravity, then your character will have a big jump, but eventually she will fall down. Whereas with a greater value, even without a jump she starts to levitate upwardsÂ until either an obstacle or the end of the area effector is met.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec68"></a>Buoyancy Effector 2D</h3></div></div></div><p>This component is used to simulate a fluid, and so it can potentially make rigidbodies floating.

This means that only the relative positions between the rigidbody and the point are taken into consideration to determine the direction of the force, which lies on both. Instead, in <span class="strong"><strong>Inverse Linear</strong></span>, the force changes its intensity based on the distance between the rigidbody and the point. For double the distance, half intensity of the force.

The <span class="strong"><strong>Inverse Linear</strong></span> mode will halve the force by doubling the distance. Finally, theÂ <span class="strong"><strong>Inversed Squared</strong></span>Â mode (which is the most physically realistic, since both the gravitation and the electromagnetic forces have this behaviour) will have a quarter of the force it would have half way closer to the point effector.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Drag</strong></span>: This is the linear drag to apply within the region of the effector.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Angular Drag</strong></span>: This is the angular drag to apply within the region of the effector.</p></li></ul></div><p>Here is an example of its usage.

This has been added recently in Unity, and thanks to it, it is possible to rotate the platform effector so as to have platforms that are inclined, or walls that can be crossed one way. For instance, you can use it also for magical portals that can be crossed one way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use One Way</strong></span>: If checked, the platform will collide only in one direction.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use One Way Grouping</strong></span>: This ensures that all contacts disabled by the one-way behaviour act on all colliders.

Imagine a puzzle game where some portals can be crossed only in one direction. As such, we can place a platform effector and set its <span class="strong"><strong>Rotational Offset</strong></span> so as to have the colliding part only on one side of the portal.

In other words, you can imagine this as a conveyor belt, which transports rigidbodies along the direction of the force, as far as they are touching the surface.</p><p>This is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_054.jpg" /></div><p>It is possible to have access to the options of theÂ <span class="strong"><strong>Surface Effector 2D</strong></span> through two foldouts, and you can find the parameter that you can set here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span>: The speed that the tangential force should maintain. In other words, it's the speed of the conveyor belt.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Speed Variation</strong></span>: The maximum variation of the speed, so as to not have always a constant speed, especially if you have many of these effectors. The random variation ranges from zero to the value in <span class="strong"><strong>Speed Variation</strong></span>. Therefore, a positive value brings a random increment, whereas a negative value brings a random decrement.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Speed Scale</strong></span>: This allows you to scale the tangential force that is applied when the effector tries to accelerate the contacting rigidbodies to the specified speed along the surface. If it is set to <code class="literal">0</code>, then no force is actually applied, and it is like that the component is disabled. On the other hand, if it is set toÂ <code class="literal">1</code>, means that the full force is applied. A useful way to think of this parameter is to think about how fast the rigidbody, which is in contact with the surface, is then accelerated to meet the specified speed; lower values means it will require more time, whereas higher values means it will reach the speed much quicker. However, you should be careful to use the full force, since a rigidbody might face other forces, leading the rigidbody to an undesired motion.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use Contact Force</strong></span>: If true, a contact force will be used. Although it is more physically realistic, it may impress a torque to the rigidbody contacting the surface. As such, in video games where realism depends on the design, you can choose to enable it, since the default is disabled. An easy way to imagine this is that you are jumping on a real conveyor belt. The contact force along with the tangential force of the conveyor belt will make your legs move forward, but your chest will stay behind due to inertia, which may result in you falling. That means your body has started to rotate due a torque as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_05_055.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>In this example, when you jump on the conveyor belt, your legs are brought forward by the tangential force of the belt. Your chest, instead, stays behind due to inertia, leading to an applied torque on your body, and therefore you will fall. In Unity, it is possible to disable the contact force, so as to ensure that a torque is not applied to rigidbodies that enter in contact with the conveyor belt.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use Friction</strong></span>: If true, there will be friction on the surface</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use Bounce</strong></span>: If true, there will be bounce on the surface</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, the natural example of usage is when in your game a conveyor belt is used. But let's try to find out another example. Suppose that the protagonist of your game has a special glove that when it touches a metal wall, it is able to contrast gravity by creating a magnetic field. You can place a surface effector vertically, and apply a force upwardsÂ as far as the player is touching that wall.</p></div></div>
