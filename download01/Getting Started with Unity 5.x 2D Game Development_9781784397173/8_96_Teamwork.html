<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec94"></a>Teamwork</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>They say it takes a village to raise a child, well, it can take a team to build a game, and a team that works well together can achieve incredible things. However, choosing the right people, dealing with conflict and working on a daily basis together isn't always straightforward. Next, we will look at a few ideas about the roles in a game development team, considerations that need to be made, and a few other things that will get you all on your way.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec125"></a>It is not just about you, it is about working in a team</h3></div></div></div><p>A good team is like any good relationship; you need to have communication, consideration, and understanding, and most importantly you must acknowledge the other person. There is no <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> in a team, but too often people get caught up in the <span class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>. In such cases, neglecting others within the team can be for many reasons, from ego, skillset (or lack of), impatience, financial gain and so on. Of course, this is not to say that such traits are negative, but in the wrong amount (just like anything), they are a sure way to end up in a disaster.</p><p>Another issue when it comes to teams is the amount of time that you have known the others. This is not bad thing, nor can it always be a good one. The idea, especially if you're going into business with each other is to keep it professional. You have a product that you need to deliver, deadlines that need to be met, and potentially stakeholders who are involved in your project. You must be able to separate business and friendship. The dynamics will change, and you need to avoid making it personal.</p><p>A game development team will consist of different roles, and how big your team is determines how those roles are carried out. In a perfect world, you will have a team member for each role, but in most cases you will have to double up on responsibilities. In saying this, a typical team is likely to consist of the following members:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The project manager</strong></span>: Who sets milestones for the team and makes sure that they are achieved. But it is not just time management; the project manager should also encourage and motivate the team and members who fall behind deadlines. They help to boost team morale and keep the project running smoothly and, more importantly, on time.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The producer</strong></span>: Who will be the person who deals with the business side of the things. They are responsible for maintaining budgets, schedules, and marketing strategies. They differ from the project manager in the sense that they are more about logistics and the technical details than managing the group's functioning.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The social media strategist</strong></span>: Who is someone who is dedicated to all social media and marketing aspects of your game. Typically, the producer is also responsible for this, but in some cases, depending on the extent of social media that you will want, having someone dedicated to promoting you game can help free up time for budgets and the financial aspect of your group's producer.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The designer</strong></span>: Who will be the one who ties all the elements together to create the overall experience. They ensure that what is created complements the story; they decide how it is revealed to the player and ultimately how the player interacts with its flow.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The artist</strong></span>: Who is responsible for creating the look of the game, from concept art of characters, assets, and levels all the way to their models and textures. It is ideal to have more than one artist if you are able to, especially if your game is large. Art takes time, especially if you want your game to be aesthetically magical.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The programmer</strong></span>: Who is like the arm to the hand of the project; without them, you are likely to struggle to make your wonderful ideas come to life. In saying all of this, if you are unlucky to not have a Programmer in your team (or not enough for all the functionalities that you may want to develop), many game engines offer visual scripting that allows you to link commands together to create actions. A great example of this is Blueprints in Unreal Engine (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.unrealengine.com" target="_blank">www.unrealengine.com</a>), as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_15.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Unreal Engine, Blueprints visual scripting (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints" target="_blank">https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints</a>)</p></div></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The sound designer/composer</strong></span>: Who makes your game sound great. The sound designer ensures that every action has some sort of audio feedback. Audio in a game includes sound effects and background music. Sound designers contribute to the atmosphere by making it sound alive. Even the subtlest effects, such as when a player nears some dark and dangerous room, can arouse all kinds of emotions.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The quality assurance (QA) tester</strong></span>: Who is the person (or people) dedicated to making sure that the game works. This can range from friends, family and professional gamers and QA testers. Ideally, you will want people who are not involved in the creation of your project to be QA testers, because even though you will be testing it yourself, it is easy to look past aspects of your game that may impact the overall gameplay experience.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The writer</strong></span>: Who<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>is usually responsible developing the story of the game. Elements of the story can include the overall plot, the characters, setting, and other narrative elements such as dialogue and narrative pathways such as alternate endings. In essence, the writer is responsible for ensuring that the story not only entices and captivates leaving them wanting for more but also to set the atmosphere and enhance the overall game experiences. In addition, the writer must also ensure that the story makes sense, follows a logical progression and is explanative. Lastly, one thing to keep in mind is that writing for games requires a different approach than movies or reading text because it is interactive.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec94"></a>Sharing a common vision</h4></div></div></div><p>When you're working in a team, it is important to have a common goal and shared interest. While it goes without saying, morale is key when it comes to working on team projects. There will be difficult moments in the project, late nights, and points where stress levels will rise, but having the support of others can improve the way that everyone is able to cope through it all. There will be moments when you are busy, not able to, or just overloaded with work that inhibits your ability to get it done. Of course, if you've been lazy, that is an entirely different situation, but you should always communicate any difficulty with the other team members, and as soon as possible. To really illustrate this point, consider the poetic notion of the Butterfly Effect: <span class="emphasis"><em>Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?</em></span> Small (unresolved) problems in the beginning become bigger problems later.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec95"></a>Managing expectations</h4></div></div></div><p>Having a common vision is not always the same as having the same expectations. For example, you and your team might want to make a high selling and popular application, but the amount of time and effort that will be given from each team member can vary. Therefore, it is important to establish expectations too, early on, for a number of reasons.</p><p>In addition to expectations, be sure to take the time to plan the development of your game properly. You don't want to over-plan what you intend to do, if you have little time or your game contains necessary components. Along the same lines, the same can be said for under-planning, where you decide on the design of the game but not allow yourself enough time to complete it in. You will get to a point where your team will begin to cut back on sections, in order to meet the goals. In the end, you might end up with something equivalent to a demo version of your game without the exciting full version to keep players interested in your work, or worse, you won't have a completed game at all.</p><p>Lastly, never assume anything. Assumptions are likely to result in disasters later on. For example, you look at the wonderfully planned Gantt chart of things to do, and at this stage your artists should be modeling assets, but in reality they aren't; or at least one of them isn't because they thought that the other artist was. Having a regular meetings and a good project manager and producer will likely avoid this situation from occurring, but always keep up to date with what others are up to.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec96"></a>Collaboration and communication are key</h4></div></div></div><p>The worst thing that can happen within a group is to stop talking. Maybe things have hit a lull and people become busy, maybe something happened in a member's personal life, in any case, things happen that may draw our attention elsewhere; it's life after all. However, this is no reason for teams to stop talking. If communication breaks down, find out why and do something about it early on. Perhaps the issue is something small and can be dealt with easily. In other cases, it can be damaging to a project's success, such as work not being completed because a team member is too embarrassed to admit that they are unable to complete a task or is simply too busy, but fails to notify anyone until the last minute. One way to avoid such problems is to make it easy to communicate within the group and to communicate often<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span></p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec97"></a>Ways to communicate</h4></div></div></div><p>While it is obvious, there are a few relatively simple ways to keep in touch by using the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>E-mail: </strong></span>The electronic snail mail is great for keeping a thread for conversations, but it can become quite difficult to manage. In these situations, it would ideal to schedule a regular (for example, weekly or monthly) progress update. Give it a deadline and a template. For example, a list of things that they need to cover such as currently working on, problems, and future work. In this way, you're able to keep up-to-date with how everyone is going, and so is everyone else. To make the whole process a bit easier to manage, there are functions such as tagging and filtering in most (if not all) e-mail software. In these instances, e-mails relating to specified criteria, such as e-mail address or subject are then directed to a specific folder and/or given a tag to make it easier to retrieve later on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></span>: You are likely to have the phone numbers of your other team members, albeit personal or business numbers. Therefore, phone messaging services like WhatsApp are great ways to keep in touch and make calls regardless of where they are in the world.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Social media groups and chats such as Facebook</strong></span>. With Facebook, you can keep communication lines open in a number of ways. You can create a message group or a private group. The difference between the two is minimal, in that they function in much the same way, you can upload documents and discuss. However, a group functions much the same way as a Facebook page. So if you upload an image, it creates a separate post, as opposed to within a chat, where it would just be added as the next part of dialogue in the conversation.
The advantages of creating a Facebook group is that it is easier to manage in terms of finding certain items, and keeping conversations more specific to a post (or topic).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Skype/Google Hangouts, and so on: </strong></span>Save time in typing something, and give someone a call. Never underestimate the power of a voice/video call. While sometimes, especially if you're working over distance, it is important to maintain contact that is beyond text communication. It adds a more personal level to your work relationship, and you get a better sense of the other person, than trying to read between the lines.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec126"></a>Version control</h3></div></div></div><p>An effective solution for artists to share files, such as textures and meshes, between them, is by using a cloud storage service (such as Google Drive or Dropbox, which we will discuss later). However, when it comes to programmers and developers, sharing files is a different situation. During the development of a game, programmers tend to work collaboratively with their code and script files. As a result, there are some important needs that should be taken into consideration:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Programmers work together on the same source code. This may involve (but is not limited to) collaborating on different areas within a project, as well as the same file(s). As a result, without having some sort of file control, it can become quite messy with no way to keep track of what has been modified.</p></li><li><p>The general nature of programming in a project will involve utilizing a range of different techniques and trying varying solutions to a range of problems that will be the best for the project. Therefore, if large changes are made or changes that are not necessarily the right solution, programmers need to have a way to go back to a previous version.</p></li><li><p>Reusing all or part of code from other sources, like libraries and source-files, where it's relevant can help to save a lot of time later on. By doing this, it is possible to save time for parts of the project that have similar elements to existing projects leaving more time for more complicated parts.</p></li></ol></div><p>By having some kind of version control in place, coders are able to utilize a file-system that not only identifies and tracks file changes, but allows programmers to reverse them. In addition, version control can also help to facilitate programmers to reuse and integrate code form external sources and/or projects. These features, and more, are supported by a piece of version control software.</p><p>Git is a free and open source program for version control. You can download it by visiting the Git home page here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.git-scm.com" target="_blank">www.git-scm.com</a>. Once installed and properly configured, it can be used to apply version control to your files, thus being an incredible asset to your workflow.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip125"></a>Tip</h3><p>There are some visual tools to manage Git in an easier way. One of the most complete is SourceTree (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com" target="_blank">www.sourcetreeapp.com</a>) by Atlassian. However, if you are a newcomer, probably you'll find it easier to use GitKraken (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gitkraken.com" target="_blank">www.gitkraken.com</a>) by Axosoft.</p><p>Moreover, if you want to learn Git, here there is a quick and nice interactive tutorial: <a class="ulink" href="https://try.github.io" target="_blank">https://try.github.io</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec127"></a>Make a GDD and stick to it</h3></div></div></div><p>When starting out, everyone will have an idea, concept, or something to add to the overall development of the game. At this stage, this is fantastic because it will give you lots to mull over when it comes to refining your game and provide you with an array of different choices to make.</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>game design document</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GDD</strong></span>)<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>is a neat way to have a current version of what your game is and will be. Think of the GDD as a manual that defines your aesthetic, audio, naming conventions, story, characters, and other bits and pieces of your game. It is a point of a reference, a game bible if you will. The structure of a GDD varies, and there is no right or wrong way to do it, as it will all depend on what your game is. However, there are some sections that define the substance of your game. For example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What is your game about? Think of this like an elevator pitch. Keep it short, sharp, and to the point. You don't want to go into too many specifics but enough to give the overall gist of your game. For example,<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>Sugar mountain, Panda invasion is a 2D real-time tower defense game where the player must defeat Pandas with various edible projectiles.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Who is your game aimed towards? Children, adults, perhaps both? Ideally, this is where you consider the demographics that you want to engage your game with.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Where will your game be featured / what devices? Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, all come with different challenges and require different considerations, so keep this in mind and defined early on to minimize headaches later on down the track.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Art</strong></span>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mood boards that define the aesthetic style that you're wanting to achieve. These can be general or specific for a character or level. That help to guide the art direction when it comes to creating concept art.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Concept art includes anything that defines the current state of the game. Of course, previous art can be kept in the GDD, but it is ideal to move it to an appendix, or separate section to maintain the relevancy of the document.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI/GUI/HUD all relates to how the interactive elements will look, and basically how anything else that isn't in the game will appear. For example, if you have a HUD (heads-up display), how will it appear in-game. How much for the screen will it take up, and how will it work with the current aesthetic style?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Characters will need to be illustrated in order to provide an idea about their appearance, which will then be modeled (or drawn in the case of 2D) and animated. Drawing characters in various poses, environments and situations will help to illustrate more about the character's personality and overall appearance.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Assets that will populate your game environment that will then be created (drawn or modeled) later on.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The background music that will set the atmosphere for the game. It can be as simple as music that provides an ambient soundtrack to exploring environments or act as audio cues when the player is approaching some significant part of the level.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Sound effects that not only provide a source of feedback for actions such as when an object makes contact with a surface but also when an event occurs such as the player winning or losing.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Story</strong></span>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Character biographies will include information that relates to each character from their general information (age and appearance), background story, personality and their relationships with other characters within the game. Depending on your type of game it will be general or extremely detailed (as with role-playing games).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The general plot of your game will provide everyone with what the game is about. Like character biographies, the level of detail will depend on the type of game. For instance, you might not even have a story if it's a game like <span class="emphasis"><em>Sudoku</em></span> (unless of course your solutions unlock doors to free a princess).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Narrative flow will explain how the narrative is revealed as the game progresses. Think of it like a map that indicates when and how parts of the narrative is revealed to the player and how each part of the game relates to the narrative. For example, having a player cross through an underground cave is not going to save the princess who is stuck in the castle on the other side of the map, unless of course the cave has a secret passage to get you there. Just like gameplay, your narrative needs to relate to what you are doing in the game, and vice versa.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Technical</strong></span>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pipeline overview will briefly explain the software that is going to be used to build the game (game engines, third-party plugins, and so on) and how to connect them together. Moreover, it establishes a connection between the art and the software, and how these can communicate (such as, how the graphics should be packed to be used in the software/game).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Technical design will explain how the different parts of your game are connected and establish conventions. Moreover, it contains how interfaces should be implemented so in order to maintain consistency within the project, and how to encapsulate the work in tasks (which can be done by different people) and how to integrate them together. Often the technical design is in a technical design document, separate from the game design, since it only used by programmers.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>System limitations will explain which are the limitations of the technology used, to other members of the team who are not programmers (in fact, more detailed limitations are in the technical design document). Like the pipeline overview, this document provides a bridge between programmers, designers and artists.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Game flow</strong></span>: It explains, in brief, how the game will play out. From one level/cut-scene/and so on, to the next. Similar to the narrative flow, game flow discusses what the player will be doing within the game as they progress through the narrative. For example, they will go to part A of the map, kill 20 dragons and then discover the magical elixir, cue cut-scene revealing the truth about his father, then the player is transported to a magical island to explore the family archives. By doing this, you begin to see the holes in your gameplay and/or story and are able to make sure that it not only makes sense but it progresses at pace that the player will enjoy; that is the game is neither too fast nor boring and confusing.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Timeline</strong></span>: It refers to the time that it takes your game from start to finish and all the progress milestones and deadlines to ensure that your game will reach the release date:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Milestones are like the stepping stones to progress your project further. These are generally when the game reaches a significant point, such as art assets completed, cool function implemented, first working prototype, and so on. Milestones can be as frequent or infrequent as you want, but they are one way to keep on top of what everyone is up to, to ensure that work is delivered within a timeframe to reach a ranger of different project targets.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Deadlines can be as daunting as they sound, because if it's an important one, it can ruin a project and end up costing (albeit money and time).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Important dates are well important. They are the days where everyone will either need to be present, on site (if you have a physical location), online (if you have a virtual location), or present in any other shape or form. These dates can be for a range of different reasons from stakeholder, client, and even potential employer meetings. Members of a team should take these meetings seriously, arrive on time, and be prepared. Meeting notes should also be taken, in order to keep a log of what happens.</p></li></ul></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec128"></a>Keeping it tidy with project management tools</h3></div></div></div><p>No one likes a cluttered workspace; even an organized chaos has its limits when you need that one document. The same goes for when you are developing games that are likely to have a lot of files. Therefore, we must find ways to not only manage the files, but also the team members so that we all know where the files are but a way to communicate with others about them. There are many programs out there for team and file management, some of the most popular and useful ones are discussed next.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec98"></a>Slack</h4></div></div></div><p>Slack (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.slack.com" target="_blank">www.slack.com</a>) is one of the most effective team management tools. It keeps all your conversations, topics, to-do lists, notes, and many other bits and pieces from your project all in the one place.</p><p>Some of these features are explained here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Channels keep topics separated and the discussion focused. Think of them like rooms that have a specific topic of discussion. For example, you may have an art channel that focuses directly on the art of your project. It also provides a place for other team members to request or check on the progress of certain items. Channels can be as broad or as narrow as you want them to be.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The app makes Slack a much easier app to manage on the go. It allows you to receive real-time updates when members of your group upload and/or post anything. In addition, it allows you to also interact with Slack whenever and wherever. For example, you get a great idea or you might see something that is useful to a concept that you're developing, with the Slack application, all you have to do is post or snap your idea and submit it to the channel. You can think of channels like groups.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Slack's App Directory allow you to integrate other applications (some of which we will explore later) into Slack to make it the ultimate project management software. You can find the App Directory at <a class="ulink" href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">https://slack.com/apps</a>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_016.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Slack tutorial video (<a class="ulink" href="https://slack.com/is" target="_blank">https://slack.com/is</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec99"></a>HacknPlan</h4></div></div></div><p>Similar to Slack, HacknPlan (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hacknplan.com" target="_blank">www.hacknplan.com</a>) is another team management software. However, it is more directed towards game development. For example, you are able to provide timelines to work towards, assign points or value to each task, which can then be used to determine the payment of a particular part of the game and/or contribution from the creator. It allows you to have, at a glance, a relatively detailed overview of project in its most current state. If you have a look at the following screenshot, you can see that there are a number of different boards, each indicating a different part of the production pipeline, from things that have yet to commence in <span class="strong"><strong>Planned</strong></span> to things that have been finishing in <span class="strong"><strong>Completed</strong></span>. I recommend that you try it out because it is one of my favorite tools!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_017.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Press Kit (<a class="ulink" href="http://hacknplan.com/press/#!" target="_blank">http://hacknplan.com/press/#!</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec100"></a>Drive</h4></div></div></div><p>Google Drive (<a class="ulink" href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com</a>), along with all of its program suite, is quite versatile and useful as a communal resource. Not only does it offer programs that are like those from other well-known commercial products, but also it has sharing capabilities that make the whole process much easier. You can easily create and share documents, files and folders with as many or as few people as you want either via a private link or through permission. There are many ways you can control access to files (from editing to read-only); it will all come down to the purpose of sharing them in the first place.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_018.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Google Drive</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip126"></a>Tip</h3><p>Some alternatives to Drive in terms of files and document creation are Apache OpenOffice (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_blank">www.openoffice.org</a>) and ONLYOFFICE (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.onlyoffice.com" target="_blank">www.onlyoffice.com</a>).</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec101"></a>Dropbox</h4></div></div></div><p>Like Google Drive, except with the addition of other software, Dropbox (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">www.dropbox.com</a>) provides a versatile tool for managing project files. It allows you to upload files, create folders, and share them and the files within them. As a result, it is a nice alternative to Drive in terms of sharing files. In addition, for documents such as Word files, it allows you to edit them in real time along with other team members, while showing you what edits are being or were made.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_019.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Dropbox Press Kit (<a class="ulink" href="http://tinyurl.com/DropboxPressKitScreenshot" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/DropboxPressKitScreenshot</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec102"></a>Trello</h4></div></div></div><p>Trello (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">www.trello.com</a>) is somewhat like a virtual pin board for task management. It allows you to create a board, where all your tasks are kept. Each board features different panels that feature tasks. Of course, these are ordered as you prefer, depending on what kind of process you are intending to use Trello for. For example, developing a pipeline style Trello board may feature different areas such as art, design, programming, and audio; all of these are then assigned tasks specific to their area. For example, the art section may feature tasks such as concepts for main menu or concept art of the princess tower, and so on. Each task can then also be assigned to specific people, or be left open for anyone in the group to engage with. Once a task is completed, it could be moved to another section, which of course, is appropriately named finished or simply left and moved to the bottom of the list. How you use Trello is ultimately up to you, but it definitely helps to keep the process streamlined.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_20.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Trello Tour (<a class="ulink" href="https://trello.com/tour" target="_blank">https://trello.com/tour</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec103"></a>Redbooth</h4></div></div></div><p>Another option, which is somewhat a mixture of Trello and Dropbox is Redbooth (<a class="ulink" href="https://redbooth.com" target="_blank">https://redbooth.com</a>), which is also known as Teambox. Redbooth allows users to share files, assign tasks to team members, and send direct messages. Like a number of other applications that we have looked at here, it also alerts you whenever the status of a project is updated.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_021.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Redbooth (<a class="ulink" href="https://redbooth.com/?ref=teambox#!/dash" target="_blank">https://redbooth.com/?ref=teambox#!/dash</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec104"></a>GitHub</h4></div></div></div><p>Earlier, we talked about Version Control. However, you still need a place to keep your repositories. GitHub (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">www.github.com</a>) offers hosting for Git repositories. It is free for public repositories, which means that everybody can see what you upload (this choice was made to encourage open source software). Otherwise, it offers paid hosting plans for your repositories.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_22.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by GitHub</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec105"></a>BitBucket</h4></div></div></div><p>Bitbucket (<a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org</a>) is a service very similar to GitHub to host your Git repositories. Here you can have private repositories for free, but the limitation is on the number of users. Up to five users is free (which is perfect for small teams); otherwise, you need to switch to a paid plan.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_023.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Bitbucket</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec106"></a>Calendar</h4></div></div></div><p>Another intuitive piece of software (or even hardware) to have is a calendar, but more importantly a calendar that is shared among your group. It is important to set deadlines, but to ensure that everyone sticks to them, use a communal calendar; it will send notifications to everyone when upcoming events, meetings, and milestones are approaching.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_024.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Google Calendar (<a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec107"></a>Pinterest</h4></div></div></div><p>A great way to communicate the aesthetic part of your idea(s) is mood boards. Pinterest (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">www.pinterest.com</a>) is an absolutely fantastic tool for this. Not only can you create different boards to pin images to, but also they can be shared among team members and be made private.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_025.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Pinterest</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec108"></a>Hootsuite</h4></div></div></div><p>One simple way to manage a number of social media channels in the one place would have to be Hootsuite (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hootsuite.com" target="_blank">www.hootsuite.com</a>). It allows you to schedule posts on various platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to name a few, we will see later) so that you can worry about other important things with your application.</p><p>In addition, it also allows you to view, at a glance, how each post has been interacted with, such as Likes, Tweets, and Favorites.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_026.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Hootsuite (<a class="ulink" href="http://signupnow.hootsuite.com" target="_blank">http://signupnow.hootsuite.com</a>)</p></div></div></div></div></div>
