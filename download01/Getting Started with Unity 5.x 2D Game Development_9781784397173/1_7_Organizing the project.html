In this section, we propose one method, which we will use during the development of the project in this book.</p><p>The key idea is to organize the different assets by type (and not, as in other methods, by their position within the level).</p><p>First of all, let's understand how Unity organizes assets. All of them are placed inside a folder named <code class="literal">Assets</code>, which can be found also inside the <code class="literal">Project</code> folder. Therefore, all our assets should be contained in this folder or subfolder. In order to create a new folder, right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>panel and then <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span>. As a result, a new folder is created within the folder you clicked. Since we don't have any folders, it will be a subfolder of the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> one. We have the option to rename it as we want. If you miss this, you can just select it and then click on it again (but not too fast, otherwise Unity will consider this as a double-click and it will open the folder), as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_006.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note6"></a>Note</h3><p>It is important to note that Unity will ignore the following categories, in order to avoid importing system files:</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Hidden folders and files</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Folder and files that starts with <code class="literal">~</code> and with <code class="literal">.</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Folders and files named <code class="literal">cvs</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Files which have a <code class="literal">.tmp</code> extension</p></li></ul></div></div><p>We need to create the following folders (you should only create the ones in bold, since we will not use the other ones):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fonts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Graphics</strong></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span> (we will see them in more detail in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04"> Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone - Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>
)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Music and sounds</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Other assets (to store, for instance, <code class="literal">.txt</code> assets)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Physical materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> (we will see what they are in the next chapter)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scripts</strong></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note7"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are planning to create a 3D game, the folders will be different and they will include other kind of assets, such as 3D models and textures.</p></div><p>At the end, we should see the following in our <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel (I'll add the <code class="literal">Animation</code> folder in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone - Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>, when we will see animations, but feel free to add it immediately if you like):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_007.jpg" /></div><p>There is something else to know about the folders in your projects. If you create folders with some specific names, Unity will treat them in a special way. We are not going to use them; however, it's worth giving them a quick look:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Editor</code> (or a subfolder within it): This contains editor scripts rather than runtime scripts. These are designed to implement new functionality in Unity during the development of your games, and will not be included in the published game. As a result, you cannot use any of the scripts inside this folder within your <code class="literal">Scene</code>. Furthermore, it's possible to use more than one <code class="literal">Editor</code> folder in your project (even if this affects the execution order).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Editor Default Resources</code>: This contains resources that can be loaded on-demand by editor scripts by using the <code class="literal">EditorGUIUtility.Load()</code> function.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Resources</code> (or a subfolder within it): This contains all the assets that can be loaded on demand from a script by using the <code class="literal">Resources.Load()</code> function. In fact, you may need to load an asset that is not present in the scene yet. As with the <code class="literal">Editor</code> folder, you can have as many as you want in your project.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Plugins</code>: This contains native DLLs, written in C/C++, which can access third-party libraries, system calls, and other functions that Unity doesn't provide directly. As the name suggests, it is used to implement or import plugins.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">StreamingAssets</code>: This contains assets that will not be included in your main game file, but that can be streamed from a script.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">WebPlayerTemplates</code>: This contains custom host pages to use when the target platform is the <code class="literal">WebPlayer</code>. Scripts in this folder will not be compiled.</p></li></ul></div><p>Coming back to our folder, we need to import the package that we have downloaded. This can be done in a number of different ways, but the easiest way is to drag and drop the folder of the package within our <code class="literal">Graphics</code> folder.</p><p>If you need to select an asset to use, in the bottom-left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, there is a slider that allows you to increase the size of the icons in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. This function is useful when there are a lot of assets and we need to find the right one without knowing the name, or when exploring new packages we don't know yet. The slider is highlighted in the following screenshot for your convenience:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_008.jpg" /></div></div>
