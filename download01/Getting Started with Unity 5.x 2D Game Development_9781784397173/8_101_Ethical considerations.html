They can be used as weapons to hurt people. Unfortunately, this ethical aspect of games is often forgotten. As such, I want to quote Jesse Schell, who wrote in his book (<span class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Game Design: a book of lenses</em></span>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"If you are designing a game that involves strangers talking each other, you must take responsibility for what that might lead to. This is one of the rare cases where your choices in game design could cause lives to be saved or lost. You might think there is a one in a million chance of something dangerous happening in your game, but if that is true, and your game is so successful that five million people play it, that dangerous thing will happen five times."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>You, as a game developer, have certain responsibilities in doing everything you could to make this never happen. If you are not willing to take such responsibilities, probably it's better not to make any game.</p><p>In my personal opinion, which is also shared by Jesse Schell as you can read from his book, you have the potential to do something good, and use video games as a tool to enhance human life. You should be inspired by questions like, Is the game I'm developing doing something good? and Can my game in some way improve the life of its players? Of course, these are not questions that game companies care about, but you as game developer should, and answer them inside you. Then, try to make your game a better game for people.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note135"></a>Note</h3><p>The same argument, but explained in more detail, can be found in a dedicated chapter of Jesse Schell's book.</p></div><p>Please, in your own way, make this world a better place!</p></div>
