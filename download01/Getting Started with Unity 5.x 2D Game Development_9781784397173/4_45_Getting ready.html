Therefore, be sure to have the Sprite Sheet imported as <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> and to set <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span>. In fact, you should have all single frames in a different sprite. Remember to rename them so that you will be less confused later on. The same applies if you are using your own graphics.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_04_001.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>An evil panda is looking forward to eat your cake</p></div></div></div>
