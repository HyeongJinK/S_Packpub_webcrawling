We also learned how to place 2D objects, order them with the Z-Buffering method, as well as how to set up tags and layers in Unity. Then, we created a couple of scripts, and learned along the way how to code complex behaviors with just a few lines. In fact, we explored how Unity handles scripts, their main functions and attributes, and the general execution order.</p><p>However, we will improve the scripts written in this chapter later on in the book, to improve the gameplay. In fact, the goal of this chapter was to get used to scripts, and to write down the main logic. Therefore, improving and tweaking is left for later.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will dive into the UI world, and integrate it into our game.</p></div>
