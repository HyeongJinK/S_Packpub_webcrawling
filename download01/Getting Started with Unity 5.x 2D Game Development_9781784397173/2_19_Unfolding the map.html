<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec23"></a>Unfolding the map</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We are finally ready to place the 2D map in our scene.</p><p>In the previous chapter, we have set the resolution to 16:9. Therefore, the maps that we will find in our packages are ready to use.</p><p>Let's start by dragging the <code class="literal">sugar_mountain_map</code> Sprite from the <code class="literal">Graphics/maps</code> folder into our scene. We need to place it in (0,0,0). Please note that the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axis is set to zero.</p><p>It is a perfect map for what we need. For example, on the left side, there is the beginning of the path that the sweet-tooth pandas will follow. At the end of the path, there is the Sugar castle that the player needs to protect. Furthermore, there is enough space at the top to implement our user interface in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player - the User Interface</em></span>.</p><p>The next step is to modify the camera settings. What we want to do is to fit the entire map in the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> view. To achieve this, just modify the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> properties to <code class="literal">22.5</code> as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_005.jpg" /></div><p>As a result, our map will be perfectly centered in the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> view. This is what we should see in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view with the camera selected:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_006.jpg" /></div><p>Now, let's bring in one of the cupcake tower we sliced in the previous chapter; for instance, the <code class="literal">ChocolateChip_Cupcake_Tower_2</code>. If we drag it to the beginning of the path, we have the following problem:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_007.jpg" /></div><p>Or also at the bottom of the map:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_008.jpg" /></div><p>In fact, the cupcake tower is not supposed to be on the rock, but behind it, due to the perspective. Since we are working in a 2D world, we need to create a perspective. Luckily, our package contains an overlay of our map. It also contains all the assets that should be in the foreground, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_009.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"></a>Note</h3><p>Please note that usually, all the assets are on different levels so we can customize their positions. However, in the package they are pre-placed as for your convenience, so we don't lose time to learn amazing things!</p></div><p>So, let's add also this overlay to the scene. It is called <code class="literal">sugar_mountain_map_overlay</code> and can be found inside the <code class="literal">Graphics/maps</code> folder. Again, remember to set its <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> positions to zero. After we have done this, we don't see any difference, and the cupcake tower still hovers over the rock. In fact, we have decided from the previous section, that all of the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis values should be assigned to the different game elements. If you remember, the value for the map overlay is <code class="literal">-9</code>.</p><p>Once you have set the map overlay <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis value, our cupcakes should behave as we wished:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_010.jpg" /></div><p>It behaves in the right way here, as well:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_011.jpg" /></div><p>The map is finally ready. One last touch; we should parent the map overlay to the map itself. Therefore, if we need to change the map, they will move and scale together.</p><p>Before we continue our journey, remember to delete the cupcake tower, since we only needed it for testing purposes.</p></div>
