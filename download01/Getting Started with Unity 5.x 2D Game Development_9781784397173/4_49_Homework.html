However, before we go to the next chapter, I invite you to give a look to these exercises to improve your skills:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Becoming an animation designer</strong></span>: Think of five games that you play, and select a part of each game such as the tutorial level, fighting a boss, walking through a forest, or even the main menu. Now, write down a list of animations that each of them have. Next, remove some animations, or even add some and think how it would alter the experience. Does it improve it, or does it change the atmosphere entirely? Could you make a relatively happy atmosphere really dark by changing some of the animations, and vice versa? By doing this, you will begin to understand the importance that animations play on not only providing life to your game, but also emotion and setting the atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Drawing an animation (Part I)</strong></span>: Imagine that you need to create an animation; you can do this simply in a graphics program. Begin by blocking out the arm; you can use a square for the hand, a rectangle for the forearm, and a longer rectangle for the upper arm. Now, move each one so that it performs a swing animation. It would be ideal to set it up like the Sprite Sheets that we have used so far. Then, import them inside Unity and test it out.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Drawing an animation (Part II)</strong></span>: Now, add details to your animation, or other body parts such as legs. Moreover, feel free to add some special effects, like the Hit animation of the panda. Once you have you animation ready, try to create a second and a third one. Then, import them all, set them up, and build an Animator controller to see how they are animated. Furthermore, you can polish your animations in order to improve the transitions between them.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part I)</strong></span>: As we have scripted, when the panda is hit, it keeps moving forward. However, the panda should be a little stunned. Only when the animation finishes, the panda should continue its advance towards the player's cake. Fix this problem with any technique you come up, so you can modify the <span class="strong"><strong>Panda Script</strong></span> or create Machine State Behaviours.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part II)</strong></span>: If you have done the previous exercise and found a solution to the fix, it's time to make your code a bit more robust. Add a Boolean value in the <span class="strong"><strong>Panda Script</strong></span> and stop the panda from moving when it is hit, but only if the Boolean is set to true. In this way, we can expose this variable in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> and give more possibilities of which kind of panda the player has to face (continued in the next chapter).</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>State Machine Behaviour as a listener</strong></span>: We have implemented the <span class="strong"><strong>Panda Script</strong></span> in such a way that triggers are set in the Animator controller to change animations. Now, remove both the Hit and Die triggers from the <span class="strong"><strong>Panda Script</strong></span> and implement other Machine State Behaviours that retrieve the value of panda's health and respectively trigger the Hit animation when health is decreased from the last time or the Die animation if it is below zero.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Explore the Animation window</strong></span>: Even if we didn't deal with the animation window, you can try to explore it, maybe by following the link to the official documentation provided. Then, try to make some animations for our sprinkles so that they can rotate while they are flying towards an evil Panda. Maybe you can also create a collision animation. Wrap these animations within an Animator controller and modify the Projectile script if needed.</p></li></ol></div></div>
