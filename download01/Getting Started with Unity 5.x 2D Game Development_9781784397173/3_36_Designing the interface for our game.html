You can do this on paper or on the computer; it depends on how you feel most comfortable.</p><p>In tower defense games, the UI often provides the way to interact with the game. Through the UI it is possible to build towers, sell them, or upgrade them. Furthermore, the UI is also used to visualize stats such as money and lives.</p><p>Here is a preliminary sketch for designing the UI for our cupcakes tower defense game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_03_049.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, a number of key components have been mapped out. These are primarily around the player's interaction, as well as the way that their opponents, the pandas, will move and be targeted on the map. For example, areas where players can place towers are roughly indicated, and the direction that the player can head in is also displayed. The UI elements, such as health, points, and tower upgrades, are also included.</p><p>Of course, at this stage, it is all about experimenting with what feels better from an interactive point of view and what looks better. By <span class="emphasis"><em>feels better</em></span>, it is not directly referring to the aesthetics but also the layout of the UI. Too many UI elements in one place can make the screen feel overwhelming, especially if they aren't explained properly. Now, this is not to say that you cannot have a lot of UI elements. In some instances, games (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>MMORPG</em></span>s) can have a large amount of UI elements, but they need to be placed in a way that is meaningful and logical. There is no sense in having a purchase tower button on one side, then an upgrade button on the other side. The simplest way to consider UI is based on routine. If first you buy a tower and then upgrade it, then you need to follow that process in the UI.</p><p>As you can see, we have placed all of the key components at the top of the screen. That way, the focus is on the map. The health is indicated with large hearts, the score is indicated with large text, and the cupcake towers are in the center of the screen. However, what is missing is some labels about what is what, such as the score and buy options for the towers. In the following screenshot, you can see the final version, where these, as well as few UI adjustments, have been made:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_03_050.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, the lives became a health bar, since it does make more sense for a strategy game (whereas for a platform, maybe lives could have suited better). Since we are targeting an occidental audience, we started to place the important elements on the left. (I apologize to readers who read from right to left, but for learning purposes I had to pick one choice. On the other hand, if you are reading this book, that means your understanding of English and languages that read from left to right is high enough to justify this interface we are developing).</p><p>Furthermore, the amount of sugar is the currency with which the player can upgrade and buy new towers. It is another important resource, and therefore has been placed below the health bar.</p><p>Next, you can find a section of the UI where the player is able to buy a tower from the three available. The following box, instead, is specific to a single tower, and it appears when the player selects a tower. It allows the player to sell and upgrade the cupcake tower.</p><p>Finally, on the right, there is the level name, which is information that the player will want to take into consideration, but not as often as health and sugar.</p><p>With this said, we have a UI design for our game, so let's start to implement it in the next sections.</p></div>
