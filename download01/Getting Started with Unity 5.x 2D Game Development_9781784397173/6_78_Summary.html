We went through an overview about navigation and some common techniques used.</p><p>Then, we built our navigation system for our game, based on waypoints. In particular, we have implemented two types of waypoint systems for our game, to learn different ways of achieving the same results.</p><p>Finally, we had another general overview about AI in games.</p><p>In the next chapter we will finish our game!
