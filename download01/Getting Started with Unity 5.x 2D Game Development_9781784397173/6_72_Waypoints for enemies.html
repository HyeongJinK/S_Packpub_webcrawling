They can contain logic to actually lead the character to specific places that change over time, such as next to the player. For instance, in a shooting game, enemies want to get closer to the player to shoot him/her. Waypoints can also perform part of the decision-making process. For example, imagine a tower defense level where the path of the enemies splits in two. In this case, the waypoints can be used to decide which direction a particular enemy should take (we will see this in the last chapter of this book). The advantages of waypoints are that, in some cases, they can be more efficient than implementing a complete pathfinding algorithm.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note94"></a>Note</h3><p>In more complex implementations, waypoints can be connected in different ways and these connections can also be created automatically by letting the waypoints find each other. Furthermore, they can also contain other information, such as which is the closest waypoint to the player. Here, the enemy can ask or query the waypoints where to head towards in order to find the player without running a complete pathfinding algorithm on the map itself.</p></div><p>At the moment, we don't need to implement a particular logic behind the waypoints. However, they are a useful tool since they allow us to move enemies around the map easily, and they are modular enough so to be able to create other levels of our game without many problems.</p><p>In this section, we will learn how to create waypoints. In particular, we will see two ways to implement them.</p></div>
