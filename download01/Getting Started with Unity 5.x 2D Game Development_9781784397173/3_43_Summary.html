Then, in the first part of the chapter, we saw in detail how the Unity UI system works. In particular, we analyzed every component of the Unity framework and learned their use and functionality. In addition, a section explained some special components present in the framework, but that we won't need for this book.</p><p>You can find more about UI designing and programming (although with a major focus on gamification), including also how to use Illustrator to create your own graphic, in <span class="emphasis"><em>Gamification with Unity 5.x</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Lauren S. Ferro</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt publishing</em></span>. You can find the book here: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/gamification-unity-5x" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/gamification-unity-5x</a>.</p><p>In the second part, we started to create the UI for the tower defense game. In particular, we implemented the logic for a health bar as well as for a sugar meter. However, we will implement more in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Secret Ingredient Is a Dash of Physics</em></span>.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are not going to be alone anymore. In fact, we will finally meet the terrible sweet-tooth pandas we have so anticipated.</p></div>
