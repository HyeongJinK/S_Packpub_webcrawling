If you go in to the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Behavior Mode</strong></span> settings, you can change the <span class="strong"><strong>Mode</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_009.jpg" /></div><p>Coming back to our main interface, let's see the main differences between 2D and 3D mode. The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view is set by default to <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span>, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_010.jpg" /></div><p>This allows us to have the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view locked on to the <span class="emphasis"><em>xy</em></span> plane.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"></a>Note</h3><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axis is used to determine which object should be rendered first. This decides which objects are in the foreground and which ones are in the background.</p></div><p>Then, every time we create a new scene, the default camera that comes with it is always set in <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> mode. Furthermore, its position is set to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">-10</code>), whereas in 3D mode, it is set to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>, <code class="literal">-10</code>). You can also check this by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and seeing its properties in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_011.jpg" /></div><p>Other differences are the options to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span> or the default objects that don't have real-time directional lights. There are also changes in the <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span> settings (you can access them from <span class="strong"><strong>Window/Lighting</strong></span>). In particular, the <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox</strong></span> is disabled for new scenes and <span class="strong"><strong>Precomputed Realtime GI</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Baked GI</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Auto-Building</strong></span> are set to off. In addition, the <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Source</strong></span> comes with a dark grey color.</p><p>In the following screenshot, you can see the default <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span> settings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_01_012.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note9"></a>Note</h3><p>The RGB code of the color of the <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Source</strong></span> that is set by default in the 2D mode is (<code class="literal">54</code>, <code class="literal">58</code>, <code class="literal">66</code>).</p></div><p>However, the most important difference is how Unity imports new 2D assets, but we are going to see this in detail in the following sections.</p></div>
