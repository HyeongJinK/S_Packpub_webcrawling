Some of these sections have already been anticipated in previous chapters. In order to have these sections explained in detail, and by also showing the code, we would have required much more time and space, which we unfortunately don't have. Therefore, you need to consider these sections as exercises. In fact, this is the only chapter in which the <span class="emphasis"><em>Homework</em></span> section is not present (although there are some explicit exercises). Please, feel free to expand and implement what captures your interest most. After all, nothing can teach you better than experience, and trial and error!</p><p>Later in the chapter, we will discover what's beyond the cake. In fact, game development is not limited to the game itself; there are many things built around that you should consider. These things may include, teamwork, playtesting, marketing, and localization! Of course, this is not a book about video game marketing, but it provides some ground to start to go beyond the mere game!</p><p>Finally, I have to say that you should congratulate yourself since you have reached this far! In fact, not only have you finished a <span class="emphasis"><em>Tower Defense</em></span> game and learnt a lot about Unity, but also you are still here, standing for the last chapter! So, to keep yourself motivated, go and grab a slice of cake before continuing to read this last chapter.</p></div>
