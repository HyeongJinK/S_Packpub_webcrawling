During this process we have understood what Sprites are, how to import them, and use the Sprite Editor in different ways. Furthermore, we have explored Unity when it is set in 2D and seen an introduction to 2D game development. Finally, we have learned how to set up scenes with the right screen resolution for our target platform.</p><p>I think that we have covered a lot in this chapter and now it's time to take a break. Go grab a coffee or even a cupcake before moving on to the next chapter, where we will learn about 2D game scripting.</p></div>
