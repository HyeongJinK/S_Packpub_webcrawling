Then, we went through the Physics engine of Unity, which is divided into some components. Rigidbodies and colliders describe the properties of physical objects in the game, whereas joints and effectors affect how they react with each other in the environment.</p><p>Finally, we saw how to deal with physics and took what we needed for our <span class="emphasis"><em>Tower Defense</em></span> game, so as to implement the collision between a sprinkle and a Panda (and call the right functions to update the Panda's health and animations).</p></div>
