<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"></a>Layers and tags</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>If you already have in mind what are you going to do, it's good to set everything up at the beginning. In particular, Unity has some labels that can be given to game objects. These are layers and tags. Unity uses these two properties to discriminate amongst certain kinds of game objects.</p><p>By default, some of them are already defined, but we need a few more for our project. From the toolbar menu, we can access the layers and tags settings by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tags and Layers</strong></span>. As a result, the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> should now look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_012.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>In this menu, we also have the possibility to change the sorting layers for rendering 2D objects. However, as mentioned earlier, we will use Z-Buffering to achieve the same effect.</p></div><p>Let's expand the <span class="strong"><strong>Tags</strong></span> menu, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_013.jpg" /></div><p>To add a new tag, just press on the + button in the bottom-right corner. We need to add two tags, respectively <code class="literal">Enemy</code> and <code class="literal">
<span class="strong"><strong>Projectile</strong></span></code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_02_014.jpg" /></div><p>In fact, we will need these two tags later on in the development of this game. In fact, when a cupcake tower searches for surrounding objects, it needs to discriminate between enemies and projectiles.</p></div>
