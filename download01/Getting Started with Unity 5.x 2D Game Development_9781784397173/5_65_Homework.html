However, we can facilitate the process by creating warnings in the code. For both our Panda and the sprinkles, create within their scripts a check, when the game object is initialized, to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component, if missing, and set it to be <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span>. Additionally, you can print a warning message (See <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What Is beyond the Cake?</em></span>, for more about debugging messages).</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Passion for acceleration</strong></span>: In the chapter, we saw how we could implement motion equations for our <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span> rigidbodies. In particular, the chapter shown an implementation of the velocity equation. Now, try to implement the acceleration equation for a <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span> rigidbody.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joint Master</strong></span>: For each one of the joints that Unity offers, think about a possible usage and example (possibly different from the ones already presented in the chapter). Then, sketch the physical system on paper, and determine which are the rigidbodies and where the anchor points are. Finally, reproduce what you have imagined within Unity, and tweak all the settings until it works as you have decided.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>Effector Master</strong></span>: For each one of the effectors that Unity offers, think about a possible usage and example (possibly different from the ones already presented in the chapter). Then, sketch how the effector should work on paper, and determine how the different rigidbodies would interact with it. Finally, reproduce what you have imagined within Unity, and tweak all the settings until it works as you have decided.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part III)</strong></span>: If you also completed the second part of this exercise back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone - Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>, some pandas will be stunned, others not, depending on the Boolean value. Instead of exposing this Boolean within the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, add this property to the <code class="literal">Projectile</code> class, so that if the Panda is stunned or not depends on which kind of projectile the Panda was hit with (we will see this later in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Through a Sea of Sprinkles – Navigation in Artificial Intelligence</em></span>
).</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part IV)</strong></span>: After you have done part three of this exercise, if the poor panda is under attack with too many sprinkles, it might not move anymore because it is always in a stunned state. As a result, it won't able to avoid the sprinkles either. So as to avoid this, we need to modify the Panda script such that if another sprinkle hits the Panda while it is stunned, it detracts the health from the Panda; but doesn't trigger from the beginning the hit animation and/or the stun period.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part V)</strong></span>: Now that you have also completed the third part of this exercise, let's improve the whole system of stunning a Panda. Add to each projectile, a variable that indicates the chance of this projectile to stunning a Panda. Finally, trigger the stunning phase of the Panda probabilistically based on the previous variable.</p><p>Finally, if you are into challenges, here is one for you:</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>The frozen conveyor belt (Part I)</strong></span>: Imagine a conveyor belt that is made of a big piece of ice and scrolls quite fast. Think and describe what would happen when a box is dropped onto it. Keep in mind that the friction on the ice is really low, and that there is inertia to consider. What if, instead of a box, there was a sphere? The solution is available at the end of the book.</p></li><li><p><span class="strong"><strong>The frozen conveyor belt (Part II)</strong></span>: Once you have done Part I, reproduce the frozen conveyor belt within the Physics engine of Unity, and try it out with boxes and spheres.</p></li></ol></div></div>
