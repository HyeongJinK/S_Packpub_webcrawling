This is all relates to the atmosphere. Creating the right mood requires a number of different things, it's not just about how it looks but what it sounds like; it also has a way of communicating something to the player. Unfortunately, we cannot yet tap into touch (although there is a lot of research going on haptic interfaces), taste, or smell (with the exception of the Nosulus, a prototype device created by Ubisoft; it can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nosulusrift.ubisoft.com" target="_blank">http://nosulusrift.ubisoft.com</a>). Therefore, how they look and sound is imperative to the atmosphere!</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec123"></a>Visuals</h3></div></div></div><p>Games don't necessarily have to look amazing to be immersive, but they need to provide a visual environment that makes sense.

Although there is not a unique interpretation of colors, you could stick with a convention throughout all of your game.</p><p>A great tool for developing color schemes (as we covered back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>) is with Adobe Color CC, which you can find at <a class="ulink" href="https://color.adobe.com" target="_blank">https://color.adobe.com</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_006.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note121"></a>Note</h3><p>Did you know that the concept of colors relating to our emotions originated from a man named Robert Plutchik<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> who created the first color wheel of emotions in 1980?</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec4"></a>Homework</h5></div></div></div><p>Look at some games. Do they have a particular color dominant over others? If so, what would happen if you change the color to something that is opposite? For example, if it's mostly blues, what would happen if you changed it to reds or yellows? Make a list of what objects are affected by the dominant color. And why or why not? If they are/aren't, how would it affect the atmosphere if you changed them?</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec85"></a>Lighting</h4></div></div></div><p>When you walk into a room full of light, you might feel fresh, energized, and positive. Imagine, on the other hand, walking into a dark room without any light to gauge what is inside, or how big it is; it may feel a bit daunting. This may be the same room, but two different lighting conditions provide two very different atmospheres. Pairing it with other sensory cues such as sounds can make it all the more terrifying or uplifting. Of course, these are your stereotypic environments; a well-lit room doesn't always mean that nothing nasty will jump out just like a dark room means that it's full of enemies. These are some things to consider, especially for 3D environments when it comes to understanding how to communicate a sense of danger or peace.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec5"></a>Lights in Unity</h5></div></div></div><p>Unity implements different kinds of lights, which can be placed within our scenes. We didn't cover them, because they are strongly related to 3D games, although you may use them also for UIs (and therefore also in 2D games).</p><p>As mentioned in the preceding section, you need to consider lights in your scene as an art expression so as to create an atmosphere. Surprisingly, good-looking scenes don't have realistic lights at all. As many things in game development, there is a trade off with performances, since usually lights are expensive, especially if computed in real time. In fact, one of the most used techniques is to "<span class="emphasis"><em>bake</em></span>" the lights, which means to pre-calculate them. Of course, this method has many limitations, and that's why there are intermediate solutions as well. A good level designer should be able to place the right kind and number of lights in the scene to enhance the look without overloading the CPU and GPU, leading to a drop of the frame rate.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Divine Unity Shrine, Shadowood Productions, Example of use of lights in Unity</p></div></div><p>We won't go any further in the details, but you can read more about them at the following links:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/lighting-overview" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/lighting-overview</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-lighting-and-rendering" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-lighting-and-rendering</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec6"></a>Homework</h5></div></div></div><p>Think of a particular part of a game that you might like. It can be inside or outside, but it has to be a single location. Now, try and find similar locations within other games. For example, let's choose a laboratory facility; compare one found in a game such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Portal</em></span> to one from <span class="emphasis"><em>Half-Life</em></span>. Keep going until you found at least five other examples and then pay attention to the lighting in each scene. Are they similar or dissimilar? Do they convey the same meaning or something different? For games that you haven't played before, watch online play through to get a sense of the environment.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec86"></a>Environment</h4></div></div></div><p>Is your game set miles below earth in a secluded dungeon, a faraway castle, enchanted forest, or perhaps inside a foreign utopian world with mountains and glorious landscapes? How you convey your environment can add to your atmosphere. For example, creating a desert may not necessarily be a large plane of sand. There is vegetation (even if very few), animals, and in some cases wreckage. However, a desert on Mars is going to be very different from a desert in Egypt, or one in Australia. The same goes for mountains, waterfalls, hills, frozen lands, forests, and beneath the Earth's surface</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Open-World demo collection of Unreal Engine: An example of a detailed forest</p></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_009.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by Alto's Adventure (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.altosadventure.com" target="_blank">www.altosadventure.com</a>): A minimalist environment, but it provides a great feel of the atmosphere that surrounds the scene</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec7"></a>Homework</h5></div></div></div><p>Similar to what we did with lighting, we can do with the environment. For example, look at many different types of forests. Are they dense or sparse? Do they have tracks to guide the player or not? Are they occupied by wildlife or are they empty? Pay attention to how they are structured and consider why they are like this. It will give you some ideas how to go about designing your own environments, what works or doesn't work, and it maybe even some inspiration to try alternative approaches to the same environment.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec87"></a>Special effects</h4></div></div></div><p>A spell isn't much of anything without some magical effects behind it, just like a magician would look a little crazy if nothing happened when he or she moved their hands or wand. Special effects add that something special to action. It also provides the player with a bit of feedback when they do something. For example, when they fire a deadly spell, you will expect at least something pretty grand will happen. Even subtle effects, such as when you heal yourself, can go a long way in creating a more immersive experience.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec8"></a>Particle systems</h5></div></div></div><p>Unity offers a great built-in particle system that can be used to create atmospheres in the scene. Here is a list of different types of particle effects that you could implement into you game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fireworks</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Rain</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Snow</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fireflies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Embers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dust</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Bubbles</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Smoke</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Leaves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fireworks</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, these are just a few suggestions, and in reality, anything can become a particle effect. Who knows, maybe Pandas could be made like that, given the right context.</p><p>Keep in mind that particle systems aren't usually computationally cheap additions to your game, but they are for sure a way to enhance the visual aspect of your game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_010.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by the Fireworks Showcase Video for Unity 5.5: Fireworks made in Unity by using particle systems</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note122"></a>Note</h3><p>It's worthwhile to mention that from Unity 5.5 a new light module has been implemented. As a result, the particles of a particle system can now cast light, with the opportunity to create amazing effects. As such, I suggest you to watch these three videos taken from the showcase of the beta version of Unity 5.5 illustrating the new features of particle systems:</p><p>Fireworks: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzmNo2fxWA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAzmNo2fxWA</a></p><p>Embers: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=copE2b_XfTc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=copE2b_XfTc</a></p><p>Trails: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQpgaP-r_lc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQpgaP-r_lc</a></p></div><p>Here you can find the official documentation about particle systems: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ParticleSystems.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ParticleSystems.html</a>.</p><p>Whereas, here is an introductory tutorial that can help you to get started (although it is for a previous version of Unity, many of the concepts apply to the new version of Unity as well): <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/particle-system" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/particle-system</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec9"></a>Post processing</h5></div></div></div><p>Post processing effects can greatly enhance the visual look of your game at a relatively cheap cost (from a computational point of view). Here is an example taken from the official documentation of Unity; it shows the difference between a scene without post processing and the same with it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_011.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_012.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Images by the official documentation of Unity</p></div></div><p>You can even program your own post processing effect.

In any case, the full documentation for post processing in Unity can be found here:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ImageEffects.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ImageEffects.html</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec10"></a>Other visual effects</h5></div></div></div><p>Unity offers other rendering effects that can be placed in the 3D world. These include Line and Trail renders to draw lines or trails. Imaging a shooting star in the most romantic scene of your game. It needs to have a trail or else it's just a point moving in the sky. Another example could be in an RTS with characters leaving a small trail, which increases the visual looking of your game although it is not realistic.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note123"></a>Note</h3><p>It's worthwhile to point out that these visual effects have been largely improved in Unity 5.5, so if you are working with previous versions, you might find them really different.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/image_08_013.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image by the official documentation of Unity: An example of the Trail Render component of Unity in action</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip124"></a>Tip</h3><p>Some of these effects are really expensive from a computational point of view. By knowing how to program in a <span class="strong"><strong>Graphic Library</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GL</strong></span>), it's possible to re-implement simpler versions (so without all of the features they have) of these effects within Unity in such a way they are highly optimized to reduce the performance overhead.</p></div><p>Other effects include Halos, Lens flares, and Projectors. Halos can be used to highlight objects in your scene, or just to simulate some really fine dust. Lens flares can simulate the effect of the sun on a camera. Projectors can be used to create relatively low-cost shadows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784397173/graphics/B03794_08_14.jpg" /></div><p>Image by Battlefield 3 (DICE, 2011): An example of flare lenses used in video games</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec124"></a>Audio</h3></div></div></div><p>Audio can move us, bring us to tears, motivate, excite, and sometimes terrify us. In some cases, it can help to place us <span class="emphasis"><em>in </em></span>an environment. The power of music is something that can really add a nice special touch if done right. At the same time as it being incredibly amazing, it can be incredibly annoying. The pace, intensity, and even instrument can all create a different mood.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec88"></a>Music</h4></div></div></div><p>Music can serve a specific purpose such as being used as background music. It can provide a level of ambience and drama to an experience that visuals alone cannot provide. Depending on the part of the game, the music is likely to change. We can think of such an example in real life, the music we would use to meditate is likely to be quite different from the music when we are lifting weights in a gym.</p><p>In saying that, background music tends to remain consistent and continues to play throughout an entire level. Whereas, gameplay tends to be dynamic and music can also reflect this. For example, a beautifully created piece of background music with strings playing softly; as soon as a dragon appears, the mood is likely to change and so is the music. Some more examples may include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Opening/closing credits, sequences, and cut-scenes.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A character encountering combat.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Being chased.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>When a character enters a dangerous area.

The use of sound can range from setting the atmosphere, indicating feedback, acknowledging an action, providing sound effects to various items (such as weapons), to indicating an event has occurred.</p><p>Using sounds are not just limited to background music. When we do things, anything, we make a noise, and gameplay is no exception. When a character knocks something over, it should make a noise, when they walk, open a door, draw a weapon, they should all make some sort of sound. Some sound effects that you may use in your game include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Spells being cast</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Ricochet</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Bullets whizzing by</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Splashing in water</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Cable/robes breaking when cut</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Doors creaking</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Glass shattering</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Footsteps</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Flying down a zip line</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec90"></a>Eliciting emotions</h4></div></div></div><p>In some instances, you'd want to elicit a certain emotion from a player such as when a character dies or when the player is triumphant. Just like movies, when we want to increase the emotion with a particular aspect of the game, albeit during a cut-scene or gameplay, music can do this. Think of some moments during gameplay when you have been moved in both a negative and positive way. Here is a list of some moments when you may want to elicit the player's emotion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Introduction of a new character(s)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Death/Birth of a character</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Sadness/Happiness</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Anger/Happiness</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Victory/Defeat</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dramatic</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creepy</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Romantic/Envy</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tension</p></li></ul></div><p>These are just some of the many emotions that your game can evoke.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec91"></a>Homework</h4></div></div></div><p>A great exercise to do before you start to decide what sounds to add into your own game is to play a range of different games and make note of what sounds they use. Do this for background music and sound effects. You might be surprised about the amount of different sounds that each game has. Also take note of how the music in levels transition, do the sounds effects also change?</p><p>Keep in mind that you don't just have to play games; watching movies and even TV series can also be useful to see the types of noises that are made, when, and if they add any kind of element (scare, represents happiness) within the scene/movie.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec92"></a>Audio in Unity</h4></div></div></div><p>Audio is another extensive topic in Unity, which from Unity 5.x has greatly improved. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to have dedicated a whole chapter on how to handle audio in Unity. However, the foundational concept is that there is a component that works as listeners. There should be only one (active) listener per each scene, otherwise Unity gives you a warning about, and it is good practice to keep in that way. Then, there is another component that works as an audio source, which can produce a sound or play some music. Moreover, audio sources can be set to act in 3D, which means that they can be placed in the environment so as to have a spatial sound (the closer the player from the audio source, the higher the volume of the audio source will be).</p><p>In the official website, there is a series of video tutorials on how to use audio in Unity, which can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec93"></a>External audio systems</h4></div></div></div><p>In case you are aiming high and the built-in audio system of Unity is not enough for your game, there are pieces of third-party software you can integrate into Unity.</p><p>One of the most used is called FMOD (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fmod.org" target="_blank">www.fmod.org</a>), which is a complete solution to integrate spatial sounds in your game.</p><p>Another similar tool, which is less used due to its high price but offers many features, is Wwise (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise" target="_blank">https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise</a>). You probably have seen its logo in some games you play.</p><p>Both FMOD and Wwise are really powerful tools, but in order to appreciate their features, you should see them in action.
