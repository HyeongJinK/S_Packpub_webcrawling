Of course, it deals with building and developing the game, but for instance, does it include programming artificial intelligence? Or UIs? Or database connections? Or animation machines? Therefore, the definition depends on the context. However, it is interesting to note how the definition changes again, when you seek a job position. As a rule of thumb, based only on experience, the bigger and larger the company is, the better the gameplay programmer job position will be. In fact, in small companies, teams can be resource limited and therefore having a gameplay programmer means that he/she will do everything, whereas in larger teams where there are AI, UI, and animation programmers, the gameplay programmer is likely to be more a coordinator of all such roles, and therefore it is a higher position.</p><p>I would like to close this section with a quote from a blog of a game developer (Ask a Game Dev at <a class="ulink" href="http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/72792621882/roles-in-the-industry-the-gameplay-programmer" target="_blank">http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/72792621882/roles-in-the-industry-the-gameplay-programmer</a>), who describes what it feels like to be a gameplay programmer:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"As you can see, being a gameplay programmer is about solving problems even moreso than the designer - you have to really figure out all of the bits of the problem and solve them all. But you also have much more in-depth knowledge of how the entire system works. You get to create those systems. You get to be the first to see something awesome happen."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Now, it's time to go into the specifics and get our tower defense game done!</p></div>
