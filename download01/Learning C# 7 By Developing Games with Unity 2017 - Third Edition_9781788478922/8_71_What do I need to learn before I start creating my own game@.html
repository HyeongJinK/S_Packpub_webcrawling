In fact, we can create a fun game just using text. The best advice for your first game is to not complicate it and use what we have learned so far to create a simple game. It doesn't matter whether it works perfectly; it's just an experience. We will have plenty of time to develop all the skills necessary to create a full game from start to finish. For now, just explore.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec47"></a>The concept</h3></div></div></div><p>Before opening any software, we need to think about the game that we want to create (this process can take a few minutes or can take a few days) until we have a clear picture in our mind about the game that we would like to create. This is the part where we usually don't think about any technical aspects of what we would need in order to create that idea, because we can veto a great idea simply because we don't know how to create it yet. For the purpose of this chapter, our concept will be inspired by a very popular platform game.</p><p>The concept of our first game is a 2D platform where the character will go from left to right, avoiding obstacles and enemies, and collecting coins, and to complete it he needs to arrive at the final position.</p><p>This is the concept for the game. Now we can imagine it as we want. It can be an easy game or a hard one, the level can be short or long, it can have multiple obstacles and enemies, or just one obstacle repeated throughout the level. Use your imagination to create the level as you please:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/da92420c-bc4a-4d06-8598-05a3304376ec.jpg" /></div><p>This is the game level that I envision, neither extremely easy nor extremely hard, a balanced challenge. So, the idea is for the character to jump on the platforms and avoid falling down the holes. It will have some coins to collect in the harder positions and three <span>checkpoints</span>.</p></div></div>
