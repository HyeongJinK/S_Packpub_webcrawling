Since variable names can be only one word, begin the first word with a lowercase and then just capitalize the first letter of every additional word. This greatly helps create descriptive names that the viewer is still able to read. There's a term for this, it's called <span class="strong"><strong>camel casing</strong></span>.</p><p>I have already mentioned that for public variables, Unity's <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> will separate each word and capitalize the first word. Go ahead! Add the previous statement to theÂ <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> and see what Unity does with it in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel.</p></div>
