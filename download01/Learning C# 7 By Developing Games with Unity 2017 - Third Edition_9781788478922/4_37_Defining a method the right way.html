Depending on who you talk to, some will say, "We have to declare a method," others will say, "We have to define a method," or even, "We have to implement a method." Which is correct? In C#, it doesn't make any difference. Use whichever term helps you learn more easily. I like to say I'm defining a method's code block, nothing like declaring a simple variable on a one-line statement.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec36"></a>The minimum requirements for defining a method</h3></div></div></div><p>There are three minimum requirements for defining a method:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The type of information, or data, that a method will return to the place from where it was called</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The name of the method should be followed by a pair of parentheses</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A pair of curly braces should be present to contain the code block:</li></ul></div><p> </p><pre class="programlisting">returnDataType  NameOfTheMethod ( ) 
{ 
 
} </pre><p>At this point, we already know that when we create a new script, there are two methods that always appear by default, <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code>. We can see that the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> methods have the three minimum requirements for a method:</p><p> </p><pre class="programlisting">void Start () 
{ 
 
}

void Update ()
{

} </pre><p>Here's what we have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Our first requirement is the type of data that the method will return to the place in the code that called this method. This method isn't returning any value, so instead of specifying an actual type of data, the <code class="literal">void</code> keyword is used. This informs Unity that nothing is being returned from the method.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The second requirement is the method name, which is <code class="literal">Start()</code>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The last requirement is the curly brackets, <code class="literal">{ }</code>. They contain the code that defines what the method is going to do.</li></ul></div><p>This example fulfills the bare minimum requirements for a method. However, as you can see, there's no code in the code block, so when <code class="literal">Start()</code> is called by Unity, it doesn't do anything at all. Yet, it's a method. Normally, if we aren't going to use a method by adding code to a skeleton method created by Unity, we can simply remove it from our script. It's normally best to remove unused code after the script has been written.</p><p>Here's what we know about this bare-minimum method definition as far as Unity is concerned:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">There's no public modifier, which means that this method is private by default. Therefore, this method cannot be called from other scripts.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">There's no code in the code block. Therefore, this method doesn't do anything. So, it can be removed if we want to remove it.</li></ul></div><p>Most of the code that we are going to write will be inside of these two methods <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code>, but we need to keep in mind that we are able to create our own methods, allowing us to expand our capabilities even more, as we are going to explore in a moment.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note23"></a>Note</h3><p>Methods that do not return any data use the <code class="literal">void</code> keyword instead of <code class="literal">datatype</code>.</p></div></div></div>
