During production, at some point, you will definitely need help from other developers. Unity has a very dedicated community of developers who are always keen to help each other.</p><p>When we encounter some hurdles, why not ask others? In most cases, there is someone like you out there with similar issues that have been resolved. A good place to talk about issues in your project is in the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Forums</code></strong>. Go ahead and create a forum account now! Don't be shy; say "hello" to others! Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Forums</code></strong> are also the perfect place to read announcements about upcoming updates.</p><p>Use Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Forums</code></strong> to read about others' work, share your work, and connect with other developers at <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.unity3d.com/" target="_blank"><span>http://forum.unity3d.com/</span></a>.</p><p>Use Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Answers</code></strong> to ask specific questions about issues that you have encountered. Remember to be very specific, try to describe the problem in detail, and don't ask general questions. For example, don't ask, "Why is my <code class="literal">GameObject</code> not moving?" Instead, ask specifically, "<code class="literal">GameObject</code> not moving when adding a rigid body force" and then describe the details. Posting your code under the question is also a very good idea.</p></div></div>
