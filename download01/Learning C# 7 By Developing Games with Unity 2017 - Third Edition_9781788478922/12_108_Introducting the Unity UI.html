It is like a separate layer where we can add images, animation, or text that through code are linked to what is happening inside the game, although it is also possible to create a full game by only using this component. With this in mind, we can see already that a lot of things are possible to create usingÂ Unity UI, but for now let's focus on the principles and learn how to create the basic interfaces, making sure that everything we do is functional before adding more features.</p></div>
