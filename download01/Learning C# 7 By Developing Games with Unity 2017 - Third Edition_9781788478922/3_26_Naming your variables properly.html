It won't change the way that the code runs, but it will help us to stay organized and, by using best practices, we are avoiding errors and saving time trying to find the piece of code that isn't working. Always use meaningful names to store your variables. If you don't do that, six months down the line, you will be lost. I'm going to exaggerate here a bit to make a point. Let's say you will name a variable as shown in this code:</p><pre class="programlisting">public bool areRoadConditionsPerfect = true; </pre><p>That's a descriptive name. In other words, you know what it means by just reading the variable. So 10 years from now, when you look at that name, you'll know exactly what I meant in the previous comment. Now suppose that instead of <code class="literal">areRoadConditionsPerfect</code>, you had named this variable as shown in the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">public bool perfect = true; </pre><p>Sure, you know what perfect is, but would you know that it refers to perfect road conditions? I know that right now you'll understand it because you just wrote it, but six months down the line, after writing hundreds of other scripts for all sorts of different projects, you'll look at this word and wonder what you meant. You'll have to read several lines of code you wrote to try to figure it out.</p><p>You may look at the code and wonder who in their right mind would write such terrible code. So, take your time to write descriptive code that even a stranger can look at and know what you mean. Believe me, in six months or probably less time, you will be that stranger.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>Using meaningful names for variables and methods is helpful not only for you but also for any other game developer who will be reading your code. Whether or not you work in a team, you should always write easy-to-read code.</p></div></div>
