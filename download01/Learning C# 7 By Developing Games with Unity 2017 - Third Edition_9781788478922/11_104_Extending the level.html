To avoid this, we will simply generate the next piece of the level every time the player leaves one level piece behind. We will also destroy the <span class="emphasis"><em>old</em></span> and already used piece of level to keep things clean.</p><p>We will use the <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter</code> method to recognize when the player reaches the <code class="literal">ExitTrigger</code> of a certain level piece:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/c4f0fa3b-3547-4e44-9aaf-8f3f0833e816.png" /></div><p>First things first, we need to make sure that our level generator contains the functionality needed to extend the level. Let's add the <code class="literal">Remove OldestPiece void</code> method to the level generator.</p><p>With your coding experience, you should easily understand line by line what we are doing in this method. If you don't, just remember that this method will remove the oldest <code class="literal">levelPiece</code> from the level.</p><p>We are getting closer to a working endless level. The last piece of the puzzle is calling the <code class="literal">AddPiece</code> and <code class="literal">RemoveOldestPiece</code> methods when the <code class="literal">Player</code> game object enters the trigger.</p><p>Let's write one more component that we will add to the <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code> game object in every <code class="literal">LevelPiecePrefab</code>. Create a new C# script and call it <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/91c80457-ec3b-4c7c-a6af-5ede2ba11598.png" /></div><p>The <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D</code> method is called automatically by Unity whenever <code class="literal">RigidBody2D</code> enters the 2D collider. If you look closely at the <code class="literal">Player</code> game object, you will see that one of its components is a <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code>. Where is our trigger then? We actually have a game object called <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code> as a child of <code class="literal">LevelPieceBasic</code>. In theory, we have all the parts needed for the <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D</code> method to be called on the <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code>.</p><p>Add the <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code> component to the <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code> game object and click <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in Unity.</p><p>What should happen? After you press <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> to start the game, our character <span>will</span> start running through the level. As soon as he enters the <code class="literal">LeaveTrigger</code> game object, we will call the <code class="literal">AddPiece</code> method to extend the level and the <code class="literal">RemoveOldestPiece</code> method to clean up the oldest piece in the level.</p><p>Please note that you can observe level generation only in the scene view. Why? Because the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> we are using to render what is happening is in a static position right now. We will add a smart script to the camera very soon to make it follow the <code class="literal">Player</code> game object:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Download <code class="literal">CameraFollow.unitypackage</code> from the Packt hub and import it to your project</li><li>Add the <code class="literal">CameraFollow</code> component to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> game object</li><li>Drag the <code class="literal">Player</code> game object into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Target</code></strong> slot in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera Follow </code></strong>component, as shown in this screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/2729805f-e8d4-4070-86da-427d1080bff6.png" /></div></div>
