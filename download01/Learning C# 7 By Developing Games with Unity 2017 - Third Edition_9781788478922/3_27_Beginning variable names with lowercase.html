There are some other guides in the C# documentation as well, but we don't need to worry about them at this stage. Component names (class names) begin with an uppercase letter. For example, it's easy to know that <code class="literal">Transform</code> is a class and <code class="literal">transform</code> is a variable.</p><p>There are, of course, exceptions to this general rule, and every programmer has a preferred way of using lowercase, uppercase, and perhaps an underscore to begin a variable name. In the end, you will have to decide upon a naming convention that you like. If you read the Unity forums, you will notice that there are some heated debates on naming variables. In this book, I will show you my preferred way, but you can use whatever is more comfortable for you.</p></div>
