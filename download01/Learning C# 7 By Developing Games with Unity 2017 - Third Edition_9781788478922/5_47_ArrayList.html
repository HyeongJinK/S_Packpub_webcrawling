We also know how to declare a new list and add, remove, and retrieve elements. Moreover, you have learned that the data stored in <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> must be of the same type across all elements. Let's throw a little curveball.</p><p><code class="literal">ArrayList</code> is basically <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> without a specified type of data. This means that we can store whatever objects we want. Storing elements of different types is also possible. <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> is very flexible.</p><p>Take a look at the following example to understand what <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> can look like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/41cdb7cb-5148-4c61-97ac-8e211955be90.png" /></div><p>You have probably noticed that <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> also supports all common operations, such as <code class="literal">.Add()</code>. Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>12</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>15</code></strong> add different elements into the array. The first two are of the <code class="literal">integer</code> type, the third is a <code class="literal">string</code> type, and the last one is a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. All mixed types of elements in one variable!</p><p>When using <code class="literal">ArrayList</code>, you might need to check what type of element is under a specific index to know how to treat it in code. Unity provides a very useful function that you can use on virtually any type of object. Its <code class="literal">GetType()</code> method returns the type of the object, not the value. We are using it in lines <strong class="userinput"><code>18</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>19</code></strong> to print the types of the second and third elements.</p><p>Go ahead, write the preceding code, and clickÂ <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>. You should get the following output in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/5f2a383a-672b-4705-acf4-f87f56f56671.png" /></div></div>
