Editing the values by code means that the values are dynamic, they can be changed at any time, they can be updated at the start of the script, or at any other time. If we choose to edit the variables in the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel, we are assuming that the values will remain the same throughout the game.</p><p>Let's create a new script and test this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/5671b5b2-8833-47c8-98e1-ecb51c4e5d91.png" /></div><p>We have created a few variables, one for the minimum speed, max speed and average speed. The idea now is to calculate the average speed, this means that this value will be dynamic while the other two will be static. So on <code class="literal">void Update()</code>, we'll write a simple line of code to calculate the average speed, <code class="literal">averageSpeed = (minSpeed + maxSpeed) / 2;</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/2af4ab10-dfb4-48f4-bfbb-7b64eee4442b.png" /></div><p>Now we assign this script to the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> camera to test it (drag and drop the script over the camera <code class="literal">GameObject</code>). By doing this, we are now able to edit the min and max values on the Unity <code class="literal">Inspector</code> panel, we can do this before clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button or at any time after that, but remember that this (updating the values in the middle of the game) is only available to do on the Unity program for test proposes:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/71d613fe-20b5-48db-a26b-bb1b2bd821d3.png" /></div><p>As we can see, the value for the average speed will be zero until we click <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/b3ff6c81-098c-4f89-984c-4f64286d471e.png" /></div><p>After clicking the play button, the average speed value starts working and we can test this by assigning different values for the min and max speed.</p><p>The variables are displayed in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel with the values set by default in the code. Remember that from now on, the value in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel will override the value in the code, so if you decide to change your code a little, the value in <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> will stay as it was initially.</p></div>
