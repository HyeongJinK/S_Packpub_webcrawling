If we press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>, we can see that it is a simple heart sprite that bounces up and down.</code></strong></p><p>At this moment, nothing will happen if the character touches the heart, so the next thing that we need to do is code our <span class="strong"><strong>Health</strong></span> prefab. Collectables generally have the same principles; they need to be collected, and if we think about it, Health Points<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>behave just like the <span class="strong"><strong>Coins</strong></span>. For that reason, we can start by duplicating the Collectable script and rename it <code class="literal">HealthPoint</code>. Remember to change the <span>name</span> in the public class (see the following image); otherwise it won't work and it will give an error when you try to play the game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/e6606c10-27f6-4781-a80c-a7ac1785ce6d.png" /></div><p>In this script, we are going to update some lines of code that tell the player it has collected a health point:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/85629bda-6bbd-4e84-8cd8-d4350871b1fd.png" /></div><p>Instead of connecting this script to the <code class="literal">GameManager</code>, like we had with the <span class="strong"><strong>Coin</strong></span>,<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>we <span>connect</span> it directly to the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>. Now we need to open the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code> script, and on the variables part we are going to create a new variable called <code class="literal">healthPoints</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/dfe62442-55b0-4ba9-8791-24b166e16b61.png" /></div><p>Then write the following code just before the last bracket:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/7a3fd717-5ade-4c36-ad3b-ceaed5685665.png" /></div><p>As we can see, the principles that we have used to create a collectable coin are very similar to the <span class="strong"><strong>Health Point</strong></span>, but instead of assigning it to the <code class="literal">GameManager</code>, we have assigned it to the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>.</p><p>Now that our character knows when he collects a Health Point, in the next chapter, we will <span>define</span> how many points he starts the game with and give him a few enemies or obstacles that can take those <span class="strong"><strong>Health Points</strong></span> away.</p></div>
