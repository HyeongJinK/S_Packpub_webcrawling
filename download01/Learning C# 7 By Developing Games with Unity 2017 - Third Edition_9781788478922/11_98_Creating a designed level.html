<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch11lvl1sec95"></a>Creating a designed level</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now let's start creating our level. Open Unity with the project that we started on Let's Make a Game! From Idea to Development or if you prefer, you can import the Unity package for this chapter that already contains all the necessary files to create the level.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the sketch that we have done. The first thing that we will be doing is setting up the floor:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/da92420c-bc4a-4d06-8598-05a3304376ec.jpg" /></div><p>As we can see in the preceding image, the floor has a few empty spaces, and that is what we will be replicating in our game. We already have one object in the <code class="literal">Game Editor</code> that calls <code class="literal">Floor</code>, but it is just a small fragment of the whole floor that we need, so it will be necessary to extend it. First, we need to change <strong class="userinput"><code>Draw Mode</code></strong> from <strong class="userinput"><code>Simple</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Tiled</code></strong>, as we can see here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/37f708f4-eca6-446d-93af-5645f4c62085.jpg" /></div><p>By doing that, we can see that a warning appears, saying that the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> used is not generated with <strong class="userinput"><code>Full Rect</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/faf40090-c5fa-426e-9a3e-201c91f7cb2e.png" /></div><p>This appears because we did not set the <code class="literal">Sprite</code> image to be tilled and although it is still possible to use that feature, it might not appear correctly. In order to turn our <code class="literal">Sprite</code> tilable, we need to go to <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite </code></strong>| <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> and change <strong class="userinput"><code>Mesh Type</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Full Rect</code></strong> and then click <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/aeefa656-1d5a-45fd-b4d3-653726b0148e.png" /></div><p>Now the warning is gone and we can change the floor width. For the width size, we have given the value <code class="literal">20</code>, and this piece of floor will represent the first piece that we have sketched. By doing that, we can see that the <strong class="userinput"><code>Box Collider</code></strong> does not follow the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> width, so we also need to change that value:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/e582f1fb-c810-410a-9000-fad931c78617.jpg" /></div><p>To fix that, we simply need to set the <strong class="userinput"><code>X Size</code></strong> of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Box Collider</code></strong> to be the same as our <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong>, that in this case is <code class="literal">20</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/201c2c1d-9e51-4661-98a6-6ceba6a1f9aa.png" /></div><p>Now that we know how to successfully create a floor with any dimensions we want, we can simply duplicate the <code class="literal">floor</code> object, move it forward, change the dimensions, and repeat the process until we have completed the level:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/c147dfc1-da7b-4545-9ed1-779f4e1e2207.png" /></div><p>So, to create a designed level this is all we need to do for the floor, we choose their size and their position, to make the jumps easier or more difficult. The same process will be applied to the collectibles, obstacles, and enemies of the game, later on we will create them and add them to this level.</p><p>Now let's move on to the more complex way of creating a level, by generating chunks of the level that will appear randomly.</p></div>
