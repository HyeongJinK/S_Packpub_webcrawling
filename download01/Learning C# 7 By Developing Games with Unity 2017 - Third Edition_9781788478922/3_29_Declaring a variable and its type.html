What does that mean? Well, before Unity can use a variable, we have to tell Unity about it first. Okay then, what are we supposed to tell Unity about the variable?</p><p>There are only three absolute requirements to declare a variable and they are
as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">We have to specify the type of data that a variable can store</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We have to provide a name for the variable</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We have to end the declaration statement with a semicolon</li></ul></div><p>The following is the syntax we use to declare a variable:</p><pre class="programlisting">typeOfData nameOfTheVariable; </pre><p>Let's use one of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> variables as an example; the following is how we declare a variable with the bare minimum requirements:</p><pre class="programlisting">int number1; </pre><p>This is what we have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #1</strong></span> is the type of data that <code class="literal">number1</code> can store, which in this case is an <code class="literal">int</code>, meaning an integer</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #2</strong></span> is a name, which is <code class="literal">number1</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #3</strong></span> is the semicolon at the end</li></ul></div><p>The second requirement of naming a variable has already been discussed. The third requirement of ending a statement with a semicolon has also been discussed. The first requirement of specifying the type of data will be covered next.</p><p>The following is what we know about this bare minimum declaration as far as Unity is concerned:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">There's no public modifier, which means it's private by default</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It won't appear in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel or be accessible from other scripts</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The value stored in <code class="literal">number1</code> defaults to zero</li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>The most common built-in variable types</h3></div></div></div><p>This section shows only the most common built-in types of data that C# provides for us and that the variables can store.</p><p>Only the basic types are presented here so that you understand the concept of a variable being able to store only the type of the data that you specify. Custom types of data, which you will create later, will be discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07"><span>Chapter 7</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Object,</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Container with Variables and Methods</em></span>.</p><p>The following chart shows the most common built-in types of data you will use
in Unity:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/01ce516b-d2e5-4a14-b7fc-4ad90d068a4d.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>There are a few more built-in types of data that aren't shown in the preceding chart. However, once you understand the most common types, you'll have no problem looking up the other built-in types if you ever need to use them. You can also create your own classes and store their instances in variables.</p></div><p>We know the minimum requirements to declare a variable. However, we can add more information to a declaration to save time and coding. In the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>, we've already seen some examples of assigning values when the variable is being declared, and now we'll see some more examples.</p></div></div>
