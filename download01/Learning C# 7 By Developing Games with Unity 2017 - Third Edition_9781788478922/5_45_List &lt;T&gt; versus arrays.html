There isn't a general rule for this. Arrays and <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> can serve the same purpose. You can find a lot of additional information online to convince you to use one or the other.</p><p>Arrays are generally faster. For what we are doing at this stage, we don't need to worry about processing speeds. Some time from now, however, you might need a bit more speed if your game slows down, so this is good to remember.</p><p><code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> offers great flexibility. You don't need to know the size of the list during declaration. There is a massive list of <span class="emphasis"><em>out-of-the-box</em></span> operations that you can use with <code class="literal">List</code>, so it is my recommendation. Array is faster, <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> is more flexible.</p></div>
