All the component properties shown in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel are member variables in the component's class. Member variables can be shown in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel or accessed by other scripts when the variable is declared public. The type of data that a variable can store is specified when it's declared. Finally, you learned that variable scope determines where it is allowed to be used.</p><p>Now that you've learned about variables, you're ready to learn the details of the C# methods that will use the variables we create, which is the topic of the next chapter.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
