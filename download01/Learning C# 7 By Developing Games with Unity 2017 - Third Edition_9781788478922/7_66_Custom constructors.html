In simple words, the default constructor creates an instance without taking any parameters. All C# objects that are not using custom constructors will be using an implicit constructor.</p><p>Another great tactic is to write your own constructors. Why? It will have you typing a lot of code, it's fun to do, and it makes code much easier to read.</p><p>Custom constructors should be written within the code block of the class. Have a look at the example first and then we'll go through the actual syntax. A custom public constructor for the <code class="literal">Person</code> class could look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/f886c509-dc72-4e15-aa0a-c79c0beb1c55.png" /></div><p>As you can see, it's nothing scary. A custom constructor is a public method that takes some parameters. The generic syntax for the public constructor will always start with the <code class="literal">public</code> keyword followed by a class name. Inside the brackets, we can write any parameters we want.</p><p>I try to keep my code consistent and I have a simple naming rule for constructor parameters. I always use a lowercase <span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span> followed by the parameter name. This way, I avoid confusion inside the constructor body. So, the <code class="literal">firstName</code> parameter is called <code class="literal">pFirstName</code> and the <code class="literal">lastName</code> parameter is called <code class="literal">pLastName</code>. Feel free to set your own rule for this. However, this one is quite common. I saw it being used by another developer and adopted it.</p><p>Let's try to implement it now. Add the two constructors to the <code class="literal">Person</code> method:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/7e64849c-d3d8-4af9-beee-97ce16da5838.png" /></div><p>You are probably wondering why we are adding an empty constructor at all. It's simply to keep a bit of flexibility if we want to instantiate the object without any data. This way, we will also stop any errors coming up inside the <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code> class, as we are using an implicit constructor there.</p><p>Let's focus on the constructor within lines <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>19</code></strong>. As you can see, there's nothing scary. It is exactly what you would expect to see, right? We are taking two string parameters, naming them according to the <span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span> rule, and assigning them to the variables within this object.</p></div>
