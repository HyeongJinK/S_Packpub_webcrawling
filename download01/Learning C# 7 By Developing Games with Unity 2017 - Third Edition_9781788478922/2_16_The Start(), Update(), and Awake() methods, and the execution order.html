<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec22"></a>The Start(), Update(), and Awake() methods, and the execution order</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The <code class="literal">Start()</code>, <code class="literal">Update()</code>, and <code class="literal">Awake()</code> methods are called automatically. The <code class="literal">Start()</code> method is called on the frame when the script is enabled. For most of our components, this will be when you press the <strong class="userinput"><code>Start</code></strong> button in Unity.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method is called just before the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method. That gives a very convenient place to set up code if you have any. The <code class="literal">Update()</code> method is very specific. It's called on every frame if the component is enabled. It's very useful for observing user keyboard actions, for example. As you can see in our script, in Line <strong class="userinput"><code>16 </code></strong>we are checking on every frame to find out whether the user has pressed the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span> key.</p><p>Let's create a new C# script and call it <code class="literal">LearningMethods</code>. As you can see, the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> methods are added automatically when you create a new script. To test them all, all that we need to do is add the <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method and a few other useful lines to print something on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/c5ebbe0c-d1e2-465d-a7a6-5f80cee0a331.png" /></div><p>As you already know, our three methods should be called in a very specific order. Add the <code class="literal">LearningMethods</code> component to some <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the Unity scene and press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>. Then stop after two seconds. Keep an eye on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> tab:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/101f7b06-d5bc-4df9-99ec-25d1fecc1a74.png" /></div><p>Wow! A lot of stuff on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> tab? Why? Scroll up to the very top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> list. We can observe that Unity has printed the <strong class="userinput"><code>Debug:Log</code></strong> information from our <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method, followed by the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method. Then the madness starts. Unity prints tons of messages from the <code class="literal">Update()</code> method. We know why! <code class="literal">Update()</code> is called on every frame, so Unity will execute the lines of code within <code class="literal">Update()</code> forever, for every frame it renders.</p><p>You can, of course, print other information to <strong class="userinput"><code>Console–</code></strong>not just messages. Replace line <strong class="userinput"><code>18</code></strong> with this line:</p><pre class="programlisting">Debug.Log(Time.time); </pre><p>Press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in Unity. You will notice that the time, in seconds, is printed, after you have pressed the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button. It's fun, isn't it? Maybe not. Don't worry, we will get into much more interesting programming after we cover dot syntax.</p></div>
