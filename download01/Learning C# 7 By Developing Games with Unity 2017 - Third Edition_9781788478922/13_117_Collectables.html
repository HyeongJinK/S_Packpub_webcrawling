In our game, we will add collectable coins scattered in the level's pieces for the player to collect. Before <span>we</span> start working on it, we need to plan what we are going to do, so this is our simple plan:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Our collectables–let's call them coins from now on–will be collected on contact with the player game object</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will write the <code class="literal">Collectable</code> class to manage coin behavior</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">For every coin collected, we will count and increment the number of collected coins on the UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The count of total collected coins will restart with a new game
</li></ul></div></div>
