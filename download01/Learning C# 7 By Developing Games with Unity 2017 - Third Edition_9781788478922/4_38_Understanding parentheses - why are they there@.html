That's one of the reasons a method is created in the first place so that we don't have to write the same code over and over. Remember the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers()</code> example method? We have mentioned that a method can take some input parameters. Why is this useful?</p><p>A script may need to add two numbers several times, but they probably won't always be the same two numbers. We can have possibly hundreds of different combinations of <span class="emphasis"><em>two numbers</em></span> to add together. This means that we need to let the method know which two numbers need to be added together at the moment when we call the method. Let's write a code example to make sure you fully understand it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/b7fb75e6-7e60-434c-b315-172e73c60bad.png" /></div><p>Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>7</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>8</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>9</code></strong> should be quite clear to you as simple declarations of variables.</p><p>Let's take a look at the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method. It's a <code class="literal">void</code> function. Again, this means the function does something but does not return any data. Inside the parentheses, our method takes two variables: <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code>.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>25</code></strong> contains the declaration and assignment of the local variable that we will be printing on line <strong class="userinput"><code>26</code></strong>.</p><p>So, <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> is written the universal way. We can reuse this function as many times as we want, passing different parameters.</p><p>Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>15</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>17</code></strong> call our function three times, each time passing different parameters to the function. Let's test whether it works! Go ahead, add the <code class="literal">LearningReusableMethods</code> component to any <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the Unity scene, and clickÂ <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>.</p><p>As this script executes, the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method is called three times, on lines <strong class="userinput"><code>15</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>17</code></strong>. The method's code block adds two numbers and displays the result in the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> tab:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/10eb9607-b277-4ee6-a5bd-55e5da822cde.png" /></div><p>As expected! The console will print out the values. There's a special name for information between the parentheses of a method definition, such as line <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong>: the code is called <span class="strong"><strong>method parameters</strong></span>.</p></div>
