A level is simply the environment that a player is placed in virtually. You are probably a gamer yourself, so I don't really need to explain this much. However, I want to talk about one
thing: we need to make a decision on how we want the level to look and behave to keep the player engaged.</p><p>A level can be either randomly generated during the game (for example, in <span class="emphasis"><em>Run)</em></span>, or have a static, designed by level designer layout (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Bros</em></span>.).</p><p>There are pros and cons to both level types. A designed level can be customized very easily and is easier to develop in general, plus we have full control of the character journey, where he starts, what he needs to do, and where he needs to arrive. This allows us to carefully choose where to place the traps, enemies, or platforms, deciding what should be happening in each part of the game.</p><p>If we choose the generating-during-gameplay approach, the level can be endless and random every time the player sees it. The player will always be challenged by different level layouts.</p><p>For this example we will be doing a designed level first, that way we can create our own unique levels and choose the difficulty for them and then we will create a generated level so we can play it infinitely.</p><p>Let's analyze how a generated level works. We will break it down into a few features of a level, which are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A level is made up of level chunks. Each chunk is simply a part of the level.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Each level chunk will be predesigned.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The level will be generated by randomly placing the chunks one by one.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A chunk will be placed in the front of the Player game object and destroyed behind the Player game object.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Level chunks will be placed seamlessly next to each other so that the player has a feeling of continuous gameplay:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/4f632232-a33d-4c32-9767-3295d3eac314.jpg" /></div><p>Individual level chunks in the preceding illustration are represented by rectangles with black edges. The section marked in the center of the image is the viewport visible to the player through Unity's camera.</p><p>So, in simple words, the player is traveling from left to right. At a later stage, we will make the camera follow the player. When the player game object enters the trigger (the green rectangle), the oldest chunk on the left-hand side will be destroyed (to preserve memory and optimal performance); at the same time, we will instantiate a new chunk in front of the player.</p><p>Great! So, this approach gives us an endless level that generates itself, and technically the player can play forever.</p></div>
