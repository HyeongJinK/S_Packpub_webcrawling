We can store specific data inside the object in its variables, and we can also write some more useful methods. OOP is a very neat and flexible concept. There is nothing stopping us from using our encapsulated object and passing it as a parameter to the other method. Let's write the following code as an example, where the class name is <code class="literal">Person</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/7e64849c-d3d8-4af9-beee-97ce16da5838.png" /></div><p>I removed most of the variables from the <code class="literal">Person</code> class to make this example clearer. If you are writing this example in the same Unity Project as the previous example, you will get some errors in the <code class="literal">Family</code> class we were using before. I recommend starting this example, in a new Unity Project and the class here is <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/fd9c4e97-2378-4bca-81ca-36ef9a3b40f3.png" /></div><p>Yes, lots of new code to analyze, awesome! What we are trying to do here is create two instances of the <code class="literal">Person</code> object. We'll cross–reference them by assigning a public member spouse, and then call the method within the object class itself. Let's analyze this step by step, as we do not want to get you confused.</p><p>Let's talk about the <code class="literal">Person</code> class first. You most certainly understand what an object is and that we can hold variables in them. However, I want to talk about the <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method inside the class itself. As you can see, this is a <code class="literal">return</code> type method that returns a <code class="literal">bool</code> value and takes one parameter. Notice the type of the parameter. The <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method takes another instance of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>13</code></strong> of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class checks whether there is any value stored in the spouse variable.</p><p>The easiest way to check whether there is any value assigned to the variable is by comparing the variable to <code class="literal">null</code>. If the variable isn't <code class="literal">null</code>, it means there is something assigned to the variable.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">null</code> keyword is a literal that represents a null reference, one that does not refer to any object. It is the default value of reference–type variables.</p></div><p>So, if spouse isn't assigned, it means our instance isn't married and we are returning <code class="literal">false</code> in line <strong class="userinput"><code>27</code></strong>. Let's talk about the <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code> class. It must be pretty obvious to you what is going on there. We are creating two instances of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class and assigning the values. Notice lines <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong>. We are assigning <code class="literal">woman.spouse</code> to a <code class="literal">man</code> object and <code class="literal">man.spouse</code> to a <code class="literal">woman</code> object. I asked you to do it this way to demonstrate that you can easily reference objects, inside other objects even if both of them are the same type.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>26</code></strong> is where the main logic happens. We are calling the <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method on the <code class="literal">man</code> instance and passing the <code class="literal">woman</code> object. Yet again, this is to demonstrate how flexible objects are. The condition in line <strong class="userinput"><code>26</code></strong> will be true if two <code class="literal">Person</code> type objects are married. If so, a suitable message is printed out in the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panel.</p><p>Go ahead and play with the code. Try to add some more methods or variables to the <code class="literal">Person</code> class. Why not add an <code class="literal">age</code> public member again and write a method to return the total number of years? The sky is the limit! The best you can do is write a lot of code. Learning by experience is the fastest way to become a decent programmer. Fingers crossed!</p></div>
