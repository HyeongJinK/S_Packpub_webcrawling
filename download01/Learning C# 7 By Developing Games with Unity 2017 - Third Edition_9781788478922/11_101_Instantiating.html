What does it mean? Instantiating simply means creating a copy of the object. Yet again, I encourage you to go back to theÂ <strong class="userinput"><code>Scripting Reference</code></strong> and read about <code class="literal">Instantiate</code>.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>36</code></strong> is where we are using Instantiate:</p><pre class="programlisting">LevelPiece piece = (LevelPiece)Instantiate(levelPrefabs[randomIndex]); </pre><p>In this line, we are creating a copy of one of the <code class="literal">levelPrefabs</code> elements stored under the <code class="literal">randomIndex</code> value. We assign the instantiated object straight away to the local piece variable. So basically, this is the line that creates an exact copy of the prefab and places it in the scene.</p><p>When instantiating a game object, we are creating a copy of the object. Unity, however, doesn't copy its parent assignment, so the instantiated object will be created on top of the hierarchy. To correct this, we set the parent to the piece object using the <code class="literal">transform.SetParent</code> function on line <strong class="userinput"><code>37</code></strong>.</p><p>Great! We know how to create a copy of a game object and assign a parent to it. The next step is to position the newly created level piece at the right place in our level. Let's try to understand the rest of the <code class="literal">AddPiece</code> function line by line.</p></div>
