For instance, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> and look at the Inspector panel. One of the components is the camera. Without that component, it will cease being a camera. It would still be a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in your scene, just no longer a functioning camera.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec29"></a>Variables become component properties</h3></div></div></div><p>When we refer to components, we are basically referring to the available functions of a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, for example, the human body has many functions, such as talking, moving, and observing. Now let's say that we want the human body to move faster. What is the function linked to that action? Movement. So in order to make our body move faster, we would need to create a script that had access to the movement component and then we would use that to make the body move faster. Just like in real life, different <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> can also have different components, for example, the camera component can only be accessed from a camera. There are plenty of components that already exist that were created by Unity's programmers, but we can also write our own components. This means that all the properties that we see in <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> are just variables of some type. They simply store data that will be used by some method.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"></a>Unity changes script and variable names slightly</h3></div></div></div><p>When we create a script, one of the first things that we need to do is give a name to the script and it's always good practice to use a name that identifies the content of the script. For example, if we are creating a script that is used to control the player movement, ideally that would be the name of the script. The best practice is to write <code class="literal">playerMovement</code>, where the first word is uncapitalized and the second one is capitalized. This is the standard way Unity developers name scripts and variables. Now let's say that we created a script named <code class="literal">playerMovement</code>. After assigning that script to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, we'll see that in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel we would see that Unity adds a space to separate the words of the name, Player Movement. Unity does this modification to variable names too where, for example, a variable named <code class="literal">number1</code> is shown as <strong class="userinput"><code>Number 1</code></strong> and <code class="literal">number2</code> as <strong class="userinput"><code>Number 2</code></strong>. Unity capitalizes the first letter as well. These changes improve readability in <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>.</p></div></div>
