The first step will be to divide the game into parts that we can work on independently.</p><p>Some of these parts will be as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Level creation</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The main character's appearance</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Player controls</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The game loop–Start, Game Over, Restart</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Collecting stuff</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Obstacles that kill the player</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The graphical user <span>interface</span></li></ul></div><p>Depending on our ideas for the game's design, this may vary, but the process will probably be the same. For our example, we need to create the level where the gameplay will happen, the character's or characters appearance and animation, where the player starts and finishes the level, the win and lose conditions, collectible objects, obstacles, enemies that kill the player, the user interface, menus, and checkpoints. There are probably other parts of the game that we will add at a later stage. In fact, this list isn't complete at all, and we will keep updating it whenever a new idea pops up.</p><p>Based on this list of the game's core components, we can have some idea about the game. Take a look at this quick sketch. It will give you a much better idea about how this game will <span>work</span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/85870629-35a0-414a-8fd1-b0a8e2e7f6e3.jpg" /></div><p>For now, we don't need to spend a lot of time drawing. At this stage, all we need to understand is the basic game mechanics. As we can see, our character will be running from left to right, jumping on the platforms, and collecting coins. The main difficulty of this level will be avoiding falling off the platforms. I hope you have an idea now. Yet again, we are making a simple game, but you will learn a lot while developing it.</p></div>
