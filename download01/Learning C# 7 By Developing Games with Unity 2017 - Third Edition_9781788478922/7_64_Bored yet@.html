We are learning a lot about theory, going through examples, and it isn't exciting at all. I promised fun and we will get there,but  I must make sure that you understand the fundamentals of OOP. This knowledge will help us design a cool–looking game that is coded using clean practices. Code can be good and bad, and it can be written in a way that is easily understood by other developers or it might be unmanageable and messy.</p><p>By learning how to organize your code, you absorb and use good practices that will help you to be a top developer who is proud of their code.
