We will create a lot of scripts, prefabs, and possibly some assets too.</p><p>The <span>main</span> mechanics of the game will be as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The movement of the playable character (run forward, backward, and jump)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Checkpoints</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Collectable coins</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Obstacles (we could animate some of them)</li></ul></div><p>In most cases, when you have your own idea for a game, you will have a vision in your mind. You will know what sort of feel and gameplay you want to achieve. However, you won't know the tiny parts of the game and how they will work together to create the game you want. This is why planning is so important. Developing the game starts in your head, and then you have to create the documentation for your ideaâ€“even if the game is as simple as <span class="emphasis"><em>Jake on the mysterious planet</em></span>. Don't be scared! You may not have to document the complete idea first, but trust me! It's worthwhile to have as much as you can written down.</p><p>There aren't any golden rules for game idea documentation. You should aim to write down as much as you want for two main reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">There might be someone else you wish to share your idea with to gather feedback.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When you write down your idea, you will have tons of new ideas on how to achieve it. Lots of things will pop up in your brain to indicate what could be a good way to do things.</li></ul></div><p>I know what I am saying is very generic, and I am not able to tell you exactly what to do. Your idea is your idea and only you can be successful with it. What I can do, however, is show you how I approach planning.</p></div>
