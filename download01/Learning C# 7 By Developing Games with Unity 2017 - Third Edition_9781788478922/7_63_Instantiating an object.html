The next step would be creating an instance of the object of that class. In C#, we use the <code class="literal">new</code> keyword to instantiate the object.</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">new ObjectType(); </pre><p>So, we are using the <code class="literal">new</code> keyword followed by an <code class="literal">ObjectType</code>, and then we have the opening and closing brackets. <code class="literal">ObjectType</code> is just your class name (we discussed this before).</p><p>Each time you instantiate an object of any class, Unity will create some space in the memory to store that object. The issue in the preceding syntax is that we are not assigning that freshly created object anywhere. Therefore, we won't be able to access its data.</p><p>The best way is to assign this object to a variable:</p><pre class="programlisting">ObjectType myObjectInstance = new ObjectType(); </pre><p>This way, we can access and change any variables inside our <code class="literal">myObjectInstance</code> object using the dot syntax. Again, let's learn from examples; OOP might seem a bit confusing at the start, but I promise you will master it by the time you've finished the whole book:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/236e169d-a7b1-493c-9265-e31dcc0b6619.png" /></div><p>Please write the preceding code. We are using the <code class="literal">Person</code> class we spoke about a bit earlier; make sure you have the <code class="literal">Person</code> class in your project too. In lines <strong class="userinput"><code>7</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>9</code></strong>, we are declaring a public member variable of type <code class="literal">Person</code>.</p><p>In line <strong class="userinput"><code>14</code></strong>, we are instantiating a new object of type <code class="literal">Person</code> and assigning it to a public member named <code class="literal">father</code>. In lines <strong class="userinput"><code>15</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>19</code></strong>, we are assigning various bits of data to the <code class="literal">father</code> variable. Please notice the syntax. To access the variables inside our object, we write the name of the instance variable followed by the dot and the name of the public variable. You can only access public variables and methods this way. Private variables are not accessible from other classes. In the same way, we have instantiated and assigned <code class="literal">mother</code> and <code class="literal">son</code> objects.</p><p>In line <strong class="userinput"><code>39</code></strong>, we are printing a quick message composed from the data stored inside the <code class="literal">father</code>, <code class="literal">mother</code>, and <code class="literal">son</code> objects. Press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in Unity and your <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> output should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/f5272d8a-29f7-438d-9075-e5bf5003fd29.png" /></div><p>Go ahead and experiment with the code, change it, and play with it!</p></div>
