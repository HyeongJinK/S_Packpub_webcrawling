A new window will pop up and this is where we can select the platform that we want:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/a861ca41-b46d-4d6f-9099-db5067c84526.png" /></div><p>Before clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong> button, we need to add the scenes that will appear in the game. To do this, we can simply drag and drop them into the empty area on top, or click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Open Scenes</code></strong> button to add the current scene that we are working on. Once we have done that, we can select the options available on the left. For <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></span> platforms, we can export it right away, as there is no need for any additional content, but for <span class="strong"><strong>Android</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span> we need to take a few things into consideration first.</p><p>For Android, we need to download <code class="literal">SDK</code> and <code class="literal">JDK</code> otherwise we can't export. To do this, we need to go to <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Unity</span> </code></strong>| <strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences</code></strong>, then select the <strong class="userinput"><code>External Tools</code></strong> option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/b53050f8-4b87-4f67-a1d9-32ab821d0f27.png" /></div><p>To download the necessary tools, all we've got to do is to click the button that says <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span>, both for <code class="literal">SDK</code> and for <code class="literal">JDK</code>. Then you can go back to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings</code></strong> window, select the Android platform, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Switch Platform</code></strong> button and then <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong>.</p><p>For <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span>, you need to be working on a <span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></span> computer otherwise you can't export the game to any <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span> platform. You've also got to have <span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span> installed on your computer. You can check the official guide on how to export the game to <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span> using <span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span>, as this is an <span class="strong"><strong>Apple</strong></span> procedure: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-ios-device-testing" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-ios-device-testing</a>.</p></div>
