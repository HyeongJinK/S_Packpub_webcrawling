You do have the ability to write down instructions, which is all a script is, just a sequence of instructions. We saw how simple it is to create a new script file. You probably create files on your computer all the time. We also saw how to easily bring forth Unity's documentation. We created a channel to communicate with other developers. Finally, we took a look at the MonoDevelop editor. None of this was complicated. In fact, you probably use apps all the time that do similar things. The bottom line: there's nothing to fear here.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, we will start off introducing the building blocks for Unity scripts by taking an introductory look at the building blocks of programming. For this, we'll be using variables, methods, dot syntax, and classes. Don't let these terms scare you. The concepts behind each one of these are similar to things that you do often, perhaps every day.</p><p>Â </p></div>
