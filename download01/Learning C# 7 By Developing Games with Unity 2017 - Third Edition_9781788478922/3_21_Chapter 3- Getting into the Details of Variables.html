It's not the actual words that cause the problem because, for most of the part, many of the words are the same as those we use in our everyday life. C# is not a foreign language. The main problem is that the words simply don't read like the typical sentences that we are all used to. You know how to say words and how to spell words. What you don't know is where and why you need to put them in that crazy-looking grammar, that is, the syntax that makes up a C# statement.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn some of the basic rules of writing a C# statement. We will also introduce many of the words that C# uses and the proper placement of these words in C# statements when we create our variables.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Writing C# statements properly</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using C# syntax to write variable statements</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">GameObject</code> component's properties</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using public variables for the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Naming a variable properly</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Declaring a variable for the type of data it will store</li></ul></div></div>
