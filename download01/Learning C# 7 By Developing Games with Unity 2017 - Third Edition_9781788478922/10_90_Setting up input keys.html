To do that, follow these simple steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open <strong class="userinput"><code>InputManager</code></strong> by going to <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>ProjectSettings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Input</code></strong>.</li><li>Increase the input size of <strong class="userinput"><code>Axis</code></strong> by one.</li><li>Select the bottom <strong class="userinput"><code>Axis</code></strong> and change its settings:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/1e743c8d-1055-457c-b12f-b6f103da8133.png" /></div><p>We have a new input button set up and the code that's executed each time the button is pressed. Time to test that. Press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in Unity and, after Jake drops on the platform, press <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span></em></span> on the keyboard. The <code class="literal">StartGame()</code> method will be called by Unity just after you press the key. The <code class="literal">StartGame()</code> method changes <code class="literal">currentGameState</code> to <code class="literal">inGame</code>, so our gameplay starts.</p><p>So, we have completed the first part of the simple <code class="literal">gameplay</code> loop. The user can start the game by pressing the button and the game will start. As we are calling it a loop, it will have to be a closed chain of events. To close the gameplay, we will need to add the <code class="literal">GameOver</code> event.</p><p>In our simple game, the game over event will be called when the player dies. There will be two ways to kill the player:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">By falling through the hole in the ground</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">By hitting obstacles</li></ul></div><p>We already have the physics functionality working, which means Jake is falling through the holes. All we need to do is create some sort of trigger telling <code class="literal">GameManager</code>Â that, "Player has fallen down the hole, game over!"</p></div>
