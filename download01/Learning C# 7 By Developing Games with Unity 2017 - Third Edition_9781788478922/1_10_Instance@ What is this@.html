What is this?</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In object-oriented programming, an instance is simply a copy of the object. In this case, there is one copy of our <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> file. We are using two terms here: <code class="literal">GameObject</code> and Object. Do not mix these up, they are, in fact, two different things. <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is an object in your Unity scene. It contains components such as <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> or our newly created <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>.</p><p>Object in programming means an instance of the script. Don't worry about the terminology too much at this stage. I am sure that the difference between these two will become much clearer soon.</p></div>
