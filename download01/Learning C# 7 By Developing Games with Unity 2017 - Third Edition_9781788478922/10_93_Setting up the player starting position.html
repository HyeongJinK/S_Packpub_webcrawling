We already mentioned that resetting the starting position of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object would be a good start. Positions in the 3D world in Unity are described using <code class="literal">Vector3 struct</code>. Go ahead and type <code class="literal">Vector3</code> in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Reference</em></span> for a better understanding. This is complex stuff, so don't worry if you can't get it. All you need to know now is that <code class="literal">Vector3</code> is made up of three floats describing <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> positions in the space.</p><p>Let's go forward and perform some code changes to set up the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> position. In <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>, we will do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Add a private <code class="literal">Vector3</code> type variable and call it <code class="literal">startingPosition</code> in <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>.</li><li>Assign the <code class="literal">startingPosition</code> value taken from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object world space position in the <code class="literal">Awake</code> method. This way, we will always store the initial position of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object just after Unity starts executing the game.</li><li>Rename the <code class="literal">Start</code> methodÂ <code class="literal">StartGame</code>, as we will call it from the <code class="literal">GameManager</code> from now.</li><li>Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> position to starting position in the <code class="literal">StartGame</code> method.</li></ol></div><p>Are you feeling a bit confused now? We have carried out a lot of changes in one go. If you really feel lost now, here's what the first part of <code class="literal">PlayerController</code> should look like (hopefully it will make you less anxious):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/f2230efa-eec2-4762-b5d8-f2214de32eff.png" /></div><p>Now, inside the <code class="literal">GameManager StartGame</code> method, make sure you are calling:</p><pre class="programlisting">PlayerController.instance.StartGame(); 
 </pre><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/2151d4c1-df2b-4394-8253-5e6cab7f90a6.png" /></div><p><span>As we can see on the image above we have added the line of code under the <code class="literal">StartGame() void</code>. Now it's time for testing</span>. Save both scripts and come back to Unity. If you are getting any compiler errors, please go back and double-check everything. If you don't have any errors, that's great! Go ahead and press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in Unity. Every time you hit the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span></em></span> button on the keyboard, the game will restart and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object's position will be set back to its initial position.</p></div>
