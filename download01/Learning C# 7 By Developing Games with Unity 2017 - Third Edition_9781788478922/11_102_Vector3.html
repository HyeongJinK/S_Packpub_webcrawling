If you haven't, I will explain it very briefly. Vector3 represents a 3D vector and a point or direction. The Unity documentation says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"This structure is used throughout Unity to pass 3D positions and directions around. It also contains functions for doing common vector operations."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Feel free to learn more about Vector3 at : <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html" target="_blank"><span>http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html</span></a>. If you are not a math master, you will feel confused now. All I want you to remember right now is that Vector3 can be used to store the position of a game object in 3D space. It contains the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> positions in 3D space. That's it! Don't bother yourself with too much information about 3D vectors at this stage; it is a massive subject.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>39</code></strong> is where we are creating a new Vector3 type variable to store the position we will move our level position to in the next few lines.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"></a>Note</h3><p>You can use <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;.Count</code> to access the current size of the list. <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;.Count</code> returns an <code class="literal">int</code> value.</p></div><p>The <code class="literal">if</code> statement on line <strong class="userinput"><code>42</code></strong> checks whether the piece we are adding to the level is the very first piece in the level. If this statement is <code class="literal">true</code>, then line <strong class="userinput"><code>44</code></strong> is executed, assigning the <code class="literal">levelStartPoint.position</code> value to the <code class="literal">spawnPoint</code> local variable.</p><p>In other words, if the <code class="literal">pieces</code> list count is <code class="literal">0</code>, it means that we are adding the very first piece to the level, and its position will be the same as that of the <code class="literal">levelStartPoint</code> variable.</p><p>If we do not add the first piece to the level, the <code class="literal">piece.Count</code> value will be different from <code class="literal">0</code> and line <strong class="userinput"><code>48</code></strong> will be executed instead of line <strong class="userinput"><code>44</code></strong>.</p><p>It is crucial that you understand fully how line <strong class="userinput"><code>48</code></strong> works. In this line, we are assigning the value to <code class="literal">spawnPoint</code>. What value? That's a good question. To get the position, we are looking back into the <code class="literal">pieces</code> listâ€“at the last element stored in that list. The last element in the <code class="literal">pieces</code> list will always be the last level piece that is already placed in the level, so we can use the <code class="literal">exitPoint.position</code> value here. Remember the <code class="literal">LevelPiece</code> class? The <code class="literal">ExitPoint</code> is the position where the next piece will connect to; you learned about this a few pages back.</p><p>Great! So at this point, we know that the <code class="literal">spawnPosition</code> value should be set to either the initial position from which the level starts or the exit point of the last piece in the level. All that we need to do now to make the newly spawned piece jump to the right position is assign its <code class="literal">.transform.position</code> value. We do that in line <strong class="userinput"><code>51</code></strong>. Line <strong class="userinput"><code>52</code></strong> adds the new piece to the list for easy access.</p><p>This was a tough phase in the game. I really hope you don't feel confused now. Don't worry too much if you do. Things will be much clearer when you see your <code class="literal">LevelGenerator</code> working in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view.</p></div>
