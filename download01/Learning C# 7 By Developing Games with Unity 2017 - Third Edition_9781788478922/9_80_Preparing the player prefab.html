Make sure your Unity Project is open first and then double–click on the <code class="literal">Player.unitypackage</code> file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/29652868-e90f-4914-91c7-ed94bedcf4f3.png" /></div><p>Unity displays a window with the assets we are importing into the project. This contains the necessary files that we prepared for the player character. For now, we'll be focusing on learning about programming the game and not about preparing game art. This is the main reason we will work with prepared assets. We will go through every prefab we are importing to understand how things work. However, you will write the code to control this prefab and create the game!</p><p>After clicking on <strong class="userinput"><code>Import</code></strong>, you will notice a bunch of folders being created in Unity. We should have the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Animations</code>: This folder contains all Unity animation files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Materials</code>: This is for storing all materials and physics materials</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Sprites</code>: This is for storing all art sprite assets</li></ul></div><p>Now that we have imported all the necessary files, we can add <code class="literal">Player.prefab</code> to our scene. It is best if you drag the <code class="literal">prefab</code> file and drop it on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> view:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/3c822c6e-38e4-42de-ba2d-50d935882b16.png" /></div><p>And this is our character, a friendly robot. The first step has been completed, importing the art and animations for the main character of the game, but we don't have any functionality programmed yet. This is our job now: we'll make him run, jump, collect stuff, and, sadly, also die:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/efc17334-4694-4d25-87ba-ce09150533ee.png" /></div><p>Before we start writing the code, we will go through the components attached to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object and look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> tab.</p><p>Let's take a look at the components we have attached to our <code class="literal">Player.prefab</code>. We'll be deliberately skipping the <code class="literal">Transform</code> component, as we have already explored this functionality.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec57"></a>Rigidbody2D</h3></div></div></div><p>According to the Unity manual documentation, a Rigidbody2D component places an object under the control of the physics engine. So simple. We add the <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> component to every object we want to enable physics behavior on; for example, in the following image, by adding physics to the other balls, they will react to the impact of the first one.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/5c6cff22-2f29-40b5-a7ee-707a23269f56.jpeg" /></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"Computer animation physics or game physics involves the introduction of the laws of</p></blockquote></div><a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" target="_blank">physics</a> into a <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation" target="_blank">simulation</a> or <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine" target="_blank">game engine</a>, particularly in <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" target="_blank">3D computer graphics</a><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>, for the purpose of making the effects appear more realistic to the observer.

Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> game object and zoom in on our character that is inside of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view. You will see a green circle. This is our 2D collider. The physics engine won't allow any other colliders to overlap with that circle. This means that, if we have a floor, for example, Jake will stand on it!</p><p>Let's test this.</p><p>Download and import <code class="literal">FloorShort.unitypackage</code>, drag the newly imported prefab to the scene, and place it underneath our character. Press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>, and you will notice that our character will drop and stay on the piece of floor we just imported:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/4a990db9-89d0-4d36-8511-69e1c133f174.png" /></div><p>Notice when the colliders meet right under his left leg; this is the collision point. The next step will be to add some functionalities to our character.</p></div></div>
