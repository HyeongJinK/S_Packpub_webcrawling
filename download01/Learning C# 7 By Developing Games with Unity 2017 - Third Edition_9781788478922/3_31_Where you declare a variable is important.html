This is where most of the variables will be written, but it's not the only place where we can write them. You will be declaring and using variables in many places in a script. The variables that I have shown you so far are called member variables.Â These member variables are the only variables that have the option of being displayed in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel or being accessed by other scripts.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>Declaring your member variables at the beginning of a class may give you a mental clue that these member variables can be used anywhere in the script.</p></div><p>We will also be creating variables in methods. These variables are called local variables. They are never displayed in the Unity's <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel, nor can they be accessed by other scripts. This brings us to another concept of programming, called variable scope.</p></div>
