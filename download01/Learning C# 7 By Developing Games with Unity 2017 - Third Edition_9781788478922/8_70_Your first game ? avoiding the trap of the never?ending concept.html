In a way, it is similar to drawing: we have a clear picture in our mind of what we want to draw, and by using a pen and paper we can transmit the picture that we have in our mind into reality. But turning our vision into reality isn't easy at all, especially at the beginning, just like our first drawings, where people were represented by sticks with a circle on top to represent the head.</p><p>That is exactly what our first game will look like, simple and unfinished, but to us it will be one of the best games ever made because we created it and it was an amazing experience. The goal is to keep creating games because eventually we will start being good at it, and game after game more people will enjoy them, so don't get discouraged if your first game doesn't look as good as you imagined.</p><p>As you are aspiring to become a good game developer, you probably have tons of brilliant ideas for games. If not, you probably have one massive idea that you really want to get done yourself as soon as possible. Maybe you do have some core game mechanics in mind but just don't know how to code it. Good! This book is precisely for you. We will move away from talking about examples and will focus more on coding actual game functionality.</p><p>I have spoken to many aspiring game developers who have <span>massive</span> multiplayer games in mind, wanting to create another <span class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Call of Duty</em></span> as their first big project. That's fine! You should think big, and you never know, you might be a part of a great team one day, developing <span class="emphasis"><em>AAA</em></span> titles in Unity. For now, however, we need to take baby steps to get there. That's why we shouldn't think about such massive ideas that take tens of millions of dollars and the most talented teams in the world to develop. We should rather think a bit smaller. You are possibly a one-man team at the moment without a massive budget, but you have a massive passion for game development. Trust me, this is all that you need to release your first game and be <span class="emphasis"><em>mega proud</em></span> of it.</p><p>Let's agree to hold on and focus on developing and finishing a simple game in the next few chapters, instead of starting and never finishing something. In this book, we will look at the simple idea of a 2D platform. We will use built-in Unity 2D tools, physics, and, of course, a lot of code.</p></div>
