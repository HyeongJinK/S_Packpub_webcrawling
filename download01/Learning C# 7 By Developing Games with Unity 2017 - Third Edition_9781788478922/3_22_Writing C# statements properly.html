When you write a line of code, it's called a statement, with a semicolon used to end the statement. This is necessary because the console reads the code one line at a time and it's necessary to use a semicolon to tell the console that the line of code is over and that the console can jump to the next line. (This is happening so fast that it looks like the computer is reading all of them at the same time, but it isn't.) When we start learning how to code, forgetting about this detail is very common, so don't forget to check for this error if the code isn't working:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/1b3fd42e-1dad-4615-a387-0b2ded217e4b.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>The reason a statement ends with a semicolon is so that Unity knows when the statement ends. A period can't be used because it is used in the dot syntax.</p></div><p>The code for a C# statement does not have to be on a single line as shown in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">public int number1 = 2; </pre><p>The statement can be on several lines. Whitespace and carriage returns are ignored, so, if you really want to, you can write it as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">public 
int 
number1 
= 
2; </pre><p>However, I do not recommend writing your code like this because it's terrible to read code that is formatted like the preceding code. Nevertheless, there will be times when you'll have to write long statements that are longer than one line. Unity won't care. It just needs to see the semicolon at the end.</p></div>
