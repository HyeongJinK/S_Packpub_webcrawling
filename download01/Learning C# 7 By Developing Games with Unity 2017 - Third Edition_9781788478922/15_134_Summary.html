Don't get discouraged if the game that you have created doesn't look like the one you had in mind, it's completely normal for that to happen, especially at the beginning when we are just learning. Treat every game that you create as a lesson, because you will be always learning new things and you'll be using those new skills on the next game and for every game that you create, a new thing will be implemented and after you've created a few projects, you will feel that it's possible to create anything.</p><p>The last piece of advice that I want to give you is don't be ashamed of the games that you create, and don't compare your games with games that were created by teams, where each person is a professional in their field. Create simple games, publish them online to receive feedback, gather a few friends to help you create a more ambitious game, and if you keep doing that, eventually you will gain a few fans or even a legion of them, so don't get discouraged with your first few games, and keep creating new ones.</p></div>
