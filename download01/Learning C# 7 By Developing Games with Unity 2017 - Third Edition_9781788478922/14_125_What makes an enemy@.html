The main focus here will be to learn the basic functionalities of an enemy and then we can choose whether we want to use them or not; that way we can create different type of enemies, just by choosing what we allow them to do.</p><p>As we can see in the following image, using this method, we are able to create a few distinct enemies:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/df3a07ca-99df-4083-86a6-881665ff9e16.jpg" /></div><p>This is a great approach, especially at the stage where we are still creating our first game; we can add a little bit of variety to our enemies and all of them share the same script.</p></div>
