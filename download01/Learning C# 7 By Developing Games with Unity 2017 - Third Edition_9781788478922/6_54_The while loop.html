It has pretty much the simplest form of any loop. The <code class="literal">while</code> loop does not create any variable to control its execution. To create a <code class="literal">while</code> loop, start with the keyword <code class="literal">while</code>, followed by brackets. Within the brackets, you must write a condition. Whenever the condition is true, the code inside the loop block will be executed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/cf3edb48-d85a-4c02-aad7-e010e5036845.png" /></div><p>It's worth knowing that this is quite a dangerous loop and you need to know how to use it. As a <code class="literal">while</code> loop does not create a control variable and is not iterating through the <code class="literal">List</code>, there is a possible scenario where a condition is always true. This will create an infinite loop-a loop that will go on forever. An infinite loop never finishes executing the loop block, and most certainly it will crash your program and even the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Editor</code></strong>.</p><p>To avoid this nasty situation - when Unity crashes and we don't even know
why we can use a variable to control the flow of the <code class="literal">while</code> loop like we did
in our <code class="literal">for</code> loop. Then, this is what the loop looks like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/9afdae15-ae3c-4842-adec-91f53a65c6f4.png" /></div><p>You have seen this before, right? This example contains exactly the same fundamental elements as a <code class="literal">for</code> loop. Line <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong> is an initializer, and within line <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong>, we have the <code class="literal">i&lt;10</code> conditions. The iterator is on line <strong class="userinput"><code>26</code></strong>.</p><p>Go ahead and type in the code. Try to predict what will happen in the <strong class="userinput"><code>ConsoleÂ </code></strong>window before you press <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> in editor.</p></div>
