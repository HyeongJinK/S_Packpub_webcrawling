It also has the simplest syntax. We use the <code class="literal">foreach</code> keyword followed by brackets in this loop. Inside the brackets, you must specify the type of data you want to iterate through inside your loop. Pick a single element variable name. You can name it whatever you like. This name is used to access this variable inside the main loop block. After the name, we write the <code class="literal">in</code> keyword, followed by our <code class="literal">List</code> variable name, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/2c0e4d94-7e17-4732-8978-aceaa5dc3923.png" /></div><p>I know it's quite confusing now, but don't worry too much about the theory. All you need to know as of now is that the code inside the <code class="literal">foreach</code> loop is called as many times as there are elements in <code class="literal">myCollectionVariable</code>. So, if <code class="literal">myCollectionVariable</code> contains 10 elements, the code inside the loop block (highlighted in pink) will be executed 10 times.</p><p>To make it a bit more <span class="emphasis"><em>eye friendly</em></span>, let's look at an actual code example. We will use the family members example from the previous chapter and print every element inside the loop on the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/d36c6b18-4333-4ec7-a770-01f8f25c5613.png" /></div><p>Write the preceding code, add it as a component to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, and clickÂ <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>. Line <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong> creates the loop (<code class="literal">foreach</code><code class="literal">familyMember</code> in <code class="literal">familyMembers</code>).</p><p>Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>21</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong> form a loop block. As our <code class="literal">List</code> contains four elements, this code block will be executed four times, each time with a different value stored in the <code class="literal">familyMember</code> local variable.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong> simply prints the output on the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong>. Your output should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/2a0cd1e7-d305-43d5-8aac-06a975a212c5.png" /></div><p>Not that scary, isn't it? Go ahead and play around with the code. You can, for example, add more elements to the <code class="literal">familyMembers</code> List.</p><p>Alternatively, you can print the number of characters each element has and so on. The sky is the limit! The <code class="literal">foreach</code> loop can be used with any type of collection, so there are no issues with using it with an <code class="literal">Array</code>, <code class="literal">ArrayList</code>, or even <code class="literal">Hashtable</code>.</p></div>
