<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch15lvl1sec124"></a>How to create a 3D game</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Creating 2D games is the best option for beginners and that is why we primarily focused on 2D games throughout the book, although almost everything that we have created for the 2D characters and platforms can be applied to 3D as well. But what makes 2D games more friendly to people just learning how to create games? Well, it is easier to find 2D images that we can use as game assets, and because with a simple knowledge of Photoshop, we are able to create our own assets or at least change the ones that we have found on the internet. On the other hand, to create 3D games, we need 3D models and we can also find some of them on the internet, but they need to be rigged if we want them to animate, and the animations need to be created on the 3D programs. Also, it is necessary to create the textures for the models, plus UV mapping the textures. All this takes time and when we start, the best way to learn is by creating many simple games to test different scripts, different components, different ways of creating things.</p><p>But when that moment arrives, or if you already have experience with 3D modeling and animation, we'll give you a few fundamentals on how <span>to create a 3D game</span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec76"></a>3D models</h3></div></div></div><p>The models can be downloaded from the internet or created by yourself, and in both cases, it will be necessary to have 3D software to create, edit, and export the files to be used inside Unity. The characters need to have a bone structure attached to them (rig) and the animations should already be created. Once this process is complete, we need to export the 3D files to an <code class="literal">.fbx</code> format:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/f62e5b45-f2ea-4be6-a84d-a315f422cc1f.png" /></div><p>Then on Unity, we go to import and we select the <code class="literal">.fbx</code> file that we have just exported. That's it, our 3D model is imported into Unity, and if we want, we can already place it inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec77"></a>3D animations</h3></div></div></div><p>After importing the main model into Unity, we can start importing the animation files. Remember that the bone structure, and all the names that we have on the main 3D model, should be exactly the same ones as the animation files, otherwise it won't work at all or it will animate with errors.</p><p>On the animation file that we have just imported, if we click it, we can see the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animation</code></strong> tab on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. Here it contains all the necessary information regarding the animation file, where we give a name to the animation and we choose the duration:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/dbc00e99-623f-4776-b368-e905ef8d1789.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec78"></a>Animator</h3></div></div></div><p>Once we have all that in place, all we need is to create a new <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator Controller</code></strong>, to do this, right-click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Assets</code></strong> panel and <strong class="userinput"><code>Create </code></strong>| <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator Controller</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/566d4585-f4f3-4ee5-8fa4-c9d142884b44.png" /></div><p>Give it a name and assign it to the character. Open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator</code></strong> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/67ef0b96-0566-4794-bccb-c0e175c927e1.png" /></div><p>Then, on the animation file, there is an arrow and we click there:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/e4c6f2c9-86df-42ad-9d98-c17c6d3054e8.png" /></div><p>This will open the contents that are present in the file, the one that we want is the animation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/0b212c25-3681-4534-ba7b-5e76574c107e.png" /></div><p>Now, drag and drop the animation inside the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator</code></strong> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/d283b3a6-1007-4980-9aea-74c794335c70.png" /></div><p>This is all we need to do to import animations into a character. Once we have all the necessary animations inside the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator Controller</code></strong>, we can make them play through a script and use the <span class="strong"><strong>Parameters</strong></span> that can be seen in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animator</code></strong> window.</p><p>Because this has a lot of parameters that we can use in order to play the animations and the focus of this chapter is just giving you an introduction to this topic, we highly recommend you check out the official Unity Documentation for this part, as it is vast and very interesting if you want to dive deep into 3D animations: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animator.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animator.html</a>.</p></div></div>
