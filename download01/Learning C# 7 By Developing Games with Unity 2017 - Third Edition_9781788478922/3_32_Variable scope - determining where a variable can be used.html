The following screenshot explains the scope of some variables:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/9d108a24-f430-46f5-8064-ee134002b0ba.png" /></div><p>You might have noticed that the rectangular blocks start and end with curly brackets. Just like the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, the code between an opening curly bracket and a closing curly bracket is called a code block. Absolutely wherever in a code you have an opening curly bracket, there will be a closing curly bracket to match. All of the code between the two brackets is a code block. Notice that code blocks can be nested inside other code blocks.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>You normally won't create bare blocks of code with curly brackets like I did in the case of <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. Code blocks usually include other things, such as <code class="literal">if</code> statements, looping statements, and methods. This example is just to demonstrate how the scope of a variable works and where a variable exists and is usable.</p></div><p>The following is what you have:</p><pre class="programlisting">Line 16: string block3 = "Block 3 text"; </pre><p>The preceding line declares a local string variable named <code class="literal">block3</code>. This variable exists in the code block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. If you try to use the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable outside of <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>, such as in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>, Unity will give you an error message saying that the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable doesn't exist.</p><p>The scope of the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable is the code block defined by the curly brackets of lines <strong class="userinput"><code>13</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>18</code></strong>:</p><pre class="programlisting">Line 6: string block1 = "Block 1 text"; </pre><p>The preceding line declares a string type member variable named <code class="literal">block1</code>. This variable exists in the code block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. This code block begins on line <strong class="userinput"><code>5</code></strong> and ends on line <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong>. This means that the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable can be used everywhere, including <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>, because they are also within <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is used in <strong class="userinput"><code>Code Block 2</code></strong> on line <strong class="userinput"><code>10</code></strong> and in <strong class="userinput"><code>Code Block 3</code></strong> on line <strong class="userinput"><code>14</code></strong>.</p><p>Thus, the scope of the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is the code block defined by the curly brackets between lines <strong class="userinput"><code>5</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong>.</p></div>
