<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec44"></a>Returning a value from a method</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now it's time to discover the <span class="emphasis"><em>power</em></span> feature of using a method. This usually means sending data to the method, which you just learned to do. Then we have the method return a value. Previously, we used a <code class="literal">void</code> type method. I have mentioned before that this is a keyword for <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span>, which means that the function isn't returning anything.</p><p>Let's learn about <code class="literal">return</code> type functions now. For this example, we won't use <code class="literal">void</code> anymore. Instead of that, we will write the type of data that we want our method to return. What is a return method? A return method is the result of all the code that we have written inside that method, it gives us an answer to the question that we choose to make. When should we use a return method? We can use this type of methods for multiple purposes, but almost all of them will have the same core functionality, solving a problem or answering a question. The return method will be there, ready to give us the answer at any time that we need; to do that, we just have to call that return method.</p><p>Let's take a look at the following example. I have highlighted two key areas that we will speak about next.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/539002c6-3b31-4e56-b624-3418751ff246.png" /></div><p>As you can see, this method is very similar to the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method that we spoke of previously. The two main differences are highlighted.</p><p>A <code class="literal">return</code> type function will always begin with a description of the type of data that it's returning. In this case, we will be returning the sum of two numbers, so our type is <code class="literal">int</code> (an integer). In simple words, the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> function is returning a number.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"></a>Returning the value</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you have decided what type of data will be returned by a method, you must tell the function what value will be returned. The syntax is very straightforward. We use the <code class="literal">return</code> keyword, highlighted in blue, followed by the value we are returning.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec3"></a>Example</h4></div></div></div><p>You just learned how to write a <code class="literal">return</code> type method. Time to put it to use! Let's write a new script and call it <code class="literal">returnTotal</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/1614bd8c-4145-4d14-bb26-bcae856d175d.png" /></div><p>What do we have here? You probably understand most of this code with no issues, but it's good practice to go through it line by line. Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>7</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>8</code></strong> contain declarations of the <code class="literal">number1</code> and <code class="literal">number2</code> integer variables. Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>27</code></strong> are exactly the same as we used in the last example. They have the declaration of a method that takes two parameters -<code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code> and it returns a value of the <code class="literal">int</code> type.</p><p>Lines <strong class="userinput"><code>30</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>34</code></strong> contain the declaration of the method that simply prints the given <code class="literal">int</code> value on the Unity console. In this case, it represents the sum of our two variables, <code class="literal">number1</code> and <code class="literal">number2</code>. Now is the most important part you need to remember. Take a look at line <strong class="userinput"><code>14</code></strong>:</p><pre class="programlisting">int sumResult = AddTwoNumbers(number1, number2);  </pre><p>The left-hand side of this line is a simple declaration of an <code class="literal">int</code> variable called <code class="literal">sumResult</code>. Simple! What I want to talk about is the right-hand side-the assignment of this variable. As you can see, what we are doing here is calling the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> method instead of simply giving the value to be stored in <code class="literal">sumResult</code>. It might look a bit awkward. You would expect a value to be passed instead of another method call.</p><p>Let me explain how it works. The <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> method is a <code class="literal">return</code> type method. It returns an <code class="literal">int</code> value in every place where you call it instantly. In even simpler words, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is an integer and a number value.</p><p>This concept might be a bit difficult to get your head around. If you still don't get it, don't worry. All you need to remember right now is the fact that, whenever a program calls a method that returns something, it is calling the method and inserting the value that the method returns into the place where it made the call. Let's test this by calling this same method again to give us another result:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/f016db43-475f-4018-991a-f4c417116190.png" /></div><p>So we added two new <code class="literal">int</code> variables called <code class="literal">number3</code> and <code class="literal">number4</code>, and inside the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method we updated the code to include a new sum result, <code class="literal">sumAnotherResult</code>. Now we have two different equations that we want to solve by using the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> method which will return us the result for both equations separately and this is the result:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/da5798bd-ec11-4045-bde3-5968905ceb63.png" /></div><p>Remember I told you that, when you call a method, it's just a substitute for the code block that will be executed. It's like taking all of the code in the method's code block and placing it right where the method was called.</p></div></div></div>
