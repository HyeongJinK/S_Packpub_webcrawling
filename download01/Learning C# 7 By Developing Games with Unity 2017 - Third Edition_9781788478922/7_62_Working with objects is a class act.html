It can be confusing at first because we know what an object is in real life, it's practically everything that humankind has created, a phone, a computer, pen, paper, keyboard, keys, all these are objects, but can we say the same regarding Unity objects? To simplify the answer, everything that we put inside of our scene inside Unity, is an object.</p><p>It doesn't matter if it's the playable character or a background image; everything that we create or add inside the scene automatically becomes an object. In the virtual world of gaming, most people consider things they can see on the screen to be objects:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/8b8bf43a-762e-4aec-bd66-d10c83c765b3.png" /></div><p>If you can expand your mind just a little bit more, perhaps you can accept that not all objects in Unity have to be something you can see in a game <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong>. In fact, the vast majority of objects in Unity are not visible in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong>.</p><p>In a computer, an object is just a small section of your computer's memory that acts like a container. The container can have some data stored in variables and some methods to work with the data.</p><p>The best example I can show you is the object you've been using since we started this book:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/674f3b1b-c002-4548-b263-b3b19686f70d.png" /></div><p>In MonoDevelop, we've been working with script called <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. In Unity, we use the general term script, but it's actually a class, which means it's a definition of a type of container. Look at line <code class="literal">4</code> of the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class LearningScript : MonoBehaviour </pre><p>See that second word? It means that <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> is a class. In this class, we defined its member variables and methods. Any variable not declared in a method is a member variable of the class.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, I told you about the magic that happens when we attach the <code class="literal">script</code> class to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. The script becomes a Component.</p><p>Besides the visual mesh in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong>, can you visualize in your mind that a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is just a bunch of different types of Component objects assembled together to construct that <code class="literal">GameObject</code>? Each of those individual Components shown in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window will become an object in our computer's memory when we click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button.</p><p>Select any <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> window and look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>. For example, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong><code class="literal">GameObject</code>. There are several Components on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong><code class="literal">GameObject</code>.</p><p>Look at each of these defined Components. Every one of these Components started off as a <code class="literal">class</code> file in Unity, defining a type of container for variables and methods:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/5f093b4f-9a56-473a-a906-7d4bc12b72d7.png" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec45"></a>A few facts</h3></div></div></div><p>We don't see or modify those Unity <code class="literal">class</code> files, but they're in Unity somewhere:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The name of the class is also known as the object type of the object that will be created in memory from that class when the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button is clicked.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Just like <code class="literal">int</code> or a string is a type of data, the name of a class is also a type of data.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When we declare a variable and specify the type of data it will store, it can easily just store a reference to an object of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> type, as shown in the following line of code:</li></ul></div><pre class="programlisting">     LearningScript myVariable; </pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Storing a reference to an object in a variable does not mean we are storing the actual object. It means we are storing the location in the memory of that object. It's just a reference that points to the object in memory so that the computer knows where to access the object's data and methods. This means we can have several variables storing a reference to the same object, but there's still only one actual object in memory.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"></a>Note</h3><p>A script is just a file on your hard drive, and there's only ever one file. The <code class="literal">class</code> file simply defines a type of container of variables and methods that will become a Component object in the memory when you click <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>. You can attach the script to many <code class="literal">GameObjects</code>, but there's still only one file on your hard drive.</p></div><p>Attaching a script to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is like placing a sticky note on the <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. When we click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button, Unity looks at our <code class="literal">GameObject</code> and sees the sticky note that says "This <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is supposed to have a Component of type <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. Make some room in the computer's memory to hold this object of variables and methods, as described in the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class file."</p><p>If we were to attach <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> to 1,000 <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> and click <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong>, there will be 1,000 separate sections created in your computer's memory, with each storing an object of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> type. Each one has its own set of variables and methods, as described by the <code class="literal">script</code> file. Each one of those 1,000 sections of computer memory is a separate Component object of its respective <code class="literal">GameObject</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"></a>Note</h3><p>Even though the object created from a class is called a <code class="literal">Component</code> by Unity, in general in C#, each object that gets created from a class is called an instance object.</p></div><p>Your brain is probably just about to start boiling. To make this easier to understand, let's write a quick example.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec46"></a>Example</h3></div></div></div><p>For <span>this</span> example, we are going to create a new script called <code class="literal">Person</code> and the first thing that we need to do is to remove the default <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> from our code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/8e631303-a59a-4ed5-9b21-81f59980801a.png" /></div><p>By removing the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> part, we are saying that this script is a class named <code class="literal">Person</code>. The main reason is that we treat the <code class="literal">Person</code> class as a simple container of the data, a C# object of type <code class="literal">Person</code>, not a Unity Component. We don't need this class to be a full–spec Unity Component.</p><p>Then we can add any type of information that we want: string, int, bool, and so on. For this example, we have written some basic information that we can ask about a person:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/6088eca2-42b9-49c3-922c-e948d6532820.png" /></div><p>As you can see, you can easily store any type of data inside your class. We make variables public as we will need to access this data from other classes.</p></div></div>
