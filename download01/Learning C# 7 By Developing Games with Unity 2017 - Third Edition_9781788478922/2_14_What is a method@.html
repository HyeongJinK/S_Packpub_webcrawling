<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"></a>What is a method?</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>When we write a script, we are making lines of code that the computer is going to execute, one line at a time. As we write our code, there will be things that we want our game to execute more than once. For example, we can write a piece of code that adds two numbers. Suppose our game needs to add those two numbers a hundred different times during gameplay. So you'd say, "Wow! I have to write the same code a hundred times to add two numbers together? There has to be a better way."</p><p>Let a method take away your typing pain. You just have to write the code to add two numbers once and then give this chunk of code a name, such as <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code>. Now, every time your game needs to add two numbers, don't write the code over and over, just call the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Using the term "method" instead of "function"</h3></div></div></div><p>You are going to see the words "function" and "method" used everywhere as you learn how to code.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>The words "function" and "method" truly mean the same thing in Unity. They also do the same thing.</p></div><p>Since you are studying C#, and C# is an <span class="strong"><strong>Object–Oriented Programming</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OOP</strong></span>) language, I will use the word <span class="emphasis"><em>method</em></span> throughout this book, just to be consistent with C# guidelines. It makes sense to learn the correct terminology for C#. The authors of <strong class="userinput"><code>Scripting Reference</code></strong> probably should have used the word "method" instead of "function" in all of their documentation. Anyway! Whenever you hear either of these words, remember that they both mean the same thing.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>From now on, I'm going to use the word method or methods in this book. When I refer to the functions shown in <strong class="userinput"><code>Scripting Reference</code></strong>, I'm going to use the word "method" instead, just to be consistent.</p></div><p>We're going to edit the <code class="literal">variableScript</code> again. In the following screenshot, there are a few lines of code that look strange. We are not going to get into the details of what they mean in this chapter. We will discuss that in <span>Chapter 4</span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting into the Details
of Methods</em></span>. Right now, I am just showing you a method's basic structure and how it works:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>In <strong class="userinput"><code>MonoDevelop</code></strong>, select <code class="literal">variableScript</code> for editing</li><li>Edit the file so that it looks exactly like what is shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/8be4472f-45f9-414a-acee-4169936e13c1.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Save the file</li></ol></div><p>In the previous screenshot, lines <strong class="userinput"><code>6</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>7</code></strong> will look familiar to you. They are variables, just as you learned in the previous section. There are two of them this time. These variables store the numbers that are going to be added.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong> may look very strange to you. Don't concern yourself right now with how it works. Just know that it's a line of code that lets the script know when the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span> key is pressed. On the keyboard method, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> will be called into action.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>The simplest way to call a function in your code is by using its name followed by brackets and a semicolon, for example, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers();</code>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Method names are substitutes, too</h3></div></div></div><p>You learned that a variable is a substitute for the value that it actually contains. Well, a method is no different. Take a look at line <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong> in the previous screenshot:</p><pre class="programlisting">void AddTwoNumbers () </pre><p><code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is the name of the method. Like a variable, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is nothing more than a named placeholder in the memory, but this time, it stores some lines of code instead. So, wherever we want to use the code in this method in our script, we just write <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> and the code will be substituted.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong> has an opening curly bracket and line <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong> has a closing curly bracket. Everything between the two curly brackets is the code that is executed when this method is called in our script. Look at line <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong> from the previous screenshot, precisely at this part:</p><pre class="programlisting">AddTwoNumbers(); </pre><p>The method named <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is called. This means that the code between the curly brackets is executed. Of course, this <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method has only one line of code to execute, but a method can have many lines of code.</p><p>Line <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong> is the action part of this method–the part between the curly brackets. This line of code adds the two variables and displays the answer on the Unity <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong>.</p><p>Then, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Go back to Unity and have the <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panel showing</li><li>Now click <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong></li></ol></div><p>Oh no! Nothing happened! Hold on... Actually, as you sit there looking at the blank <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panel, the script is running perfectly, just as we programmed it. The first part of line <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong> in the script is waiting for you to press the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span> key. Press it now.</p><p>And there you go! The following screenshot shows you the result of adding two variables that contain the numbers <strong class="userinput"><code>2</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>9</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/c1403f5c-6838-4d03-a6d0-a61ca133467d.png" /></div><p>In our <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>, line <strong class="userinput"><code>16</code></strong> waited for you to press the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span> key. When you do this, the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method is executed. When you do this, line <strong class="userinput"><code>17</code></strong>, which calls the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method, is executed. This allows the code block of the method, line <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong>, to add the values stored in the <code class="literal">number1</code> and <code class="literal">number2</code> variables.</p><p>While Unity is in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> mode, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> so that its components appear in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel, locate <code class="literal">variableScript</code> and its two variables. Change the values, currently <code class="literal">2</code> and <code class="literal">9</code>, to something else. Make sure that you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> panel so that it has focus. Then press the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span> key again. You will see the result of the new addition in <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong>.</p><p>You just learned how a method works to allow a specific block of code to be called in order to perform a task. We didn't get into any of the wording details of methods here. This was just to show you fundamentally how they work. We'll get into the finer details of methods in a later chapter.</p></div></div>
