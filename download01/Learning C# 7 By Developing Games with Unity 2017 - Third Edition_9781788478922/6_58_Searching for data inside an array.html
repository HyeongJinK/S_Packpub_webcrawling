It's very straightforward, as long as you know the specific index your element is stored under. If you don't, you can search for it by iterating through the entire array object.</p><p>Yet again, let's go back to the <code class="literal">familyMembers</code> example and try to look for the index of the <code class="literal">"Adam"</code> string value:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/3a32f034-4962-427d-87bc-347aa2609aef.png" /></div><p>We are not going too much into the details. The easiest way of finding the index of a certain element in the collection is by looping through the array and comparing elements. You can spot that on line <strong class="userinput"><code>22</code></strong>. If the <code class="literal">familyMembers[i] == "Adam"</code> condition is true, line <strong class="userinput"><code>23</code></strong> will be executed. The <code class="literal">adamsIndex</code> variable will then be assigned the current <code class="literal">i</code> value.</p><p>Notice the default value of <code class="literal">adamsIndex</code>. I deliberately assigned it <code class="literal">-1</code> so that we can check on line <strong class="userinput"><code>29</code></strong> whether there were any changes to this value inside the loop. If it's still <code class="literal">-1</code>, it means that the value we are trying to find inside the array was not found
at all.</p></div>
