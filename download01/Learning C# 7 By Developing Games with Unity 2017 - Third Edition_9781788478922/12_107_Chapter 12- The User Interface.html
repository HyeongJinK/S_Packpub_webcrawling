We will construct and implement a simple, dynamic UI using Unity's built-in UI system.</p><p>But what is a UI? As the name suggests, a user interface is the text, images, or animations that we can see on top of our game; it is a bridge between a human and a computer program, practically all the graphical elements that the user can interact with to control the game or to get information from it. For example, virtual buttons that we can see displayed on mobile games are part of the UI,<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>and the text that shows us the number of coins that we have collected is also part of the UI.</p><p>For our game, we need a few UI elements to make it more interesting and to give it a purpose, because without any graphics we don't know how many coins we have collected, how <span>much</span> time we have left, or whether we have broken our previous record.</p><p>So in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introducing the Unity UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating UI views</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Connecting buttons to actions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Switching UI views</li></ul></div><p>So far, our sole focus has been on learning how to code. I would like to make a little exception in this chapter and talk about coding the UI functionality, as well as creating a good-looking UI.</p></div>
