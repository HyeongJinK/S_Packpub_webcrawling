Create a new project in Unity. Save it in an easily accessible place. Make sure you have switched the project type to <strong class="userinput"><code>2D</code></strong>. It will save us some time while importing assets such as sprites or textures.</p><p>There's nothing to worry about here; just make sure you select <strong class="userinput"><code>2D</code></strong>, as in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/c0a0ffb8-451f-41e8-9740-578f3616efe8.png" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec55"></a>Backup</h3></div></div></div><p>Backing up isn't a direct topic in this book; however, I really want to highlight how important this is. Backing up your files will definitely save you from disaster at some point. Lots of things can happen, from hardware failure to rare internal Unity bugs that can ruin your project. That's why it's wise to have a copy of your project somewhere.</p><p>I would love to tell you a lot about version control and ways to secure your project. However, version control is a rather advanced topic. We will leave it for now. I recommend zipping your project at least once a day and keeping it in one of the cloud storage services, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec56"></a>Keeping your project clean</h3></div></div></div><p>Organisation is one of the most important aspects if we want to achieve success in our projects, and so before we get into developing our first game, let's take a look at the importance of keeping our project structure clean.</p><p>Unity is very flexible in terms of file placement in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder. This is good, but it can get you into trouble if you overuse it. Let's set up a few rules that we will follow to make sure our project won't end up being messy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">We'll keep all <code class="literal">Assets</code> files inside subfolders and not in the root of the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We'll always name files in the best possible way</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We'll never call any files <code class="literal">test</code>; if you are importing a test asset, name it<code class="literal">test_xxx</code>, where <code class="literal">xxx</code> explains what the file actually contains</li></ul></div><p>Another tip that I can give you is to keep subfolders organized. Have a look at the following screenshot, which shows examples of a bad and good project structure. On the left–hand side of the screenshot, you can see shockingly disorganized files. There are files placed in the root of the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder and different types of files are placed next to each other. On the right–hand side of the screenshot, you can see how I want you to organize your projects. Keep it neat and clean.</p><p>You won't regret it when your simple project grows into something bigger that is still easy to manage:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478922/graphics/fc0b1c9d-9a48-4f64-b5c3-ac143f2575fa.png" /></div><p>We are ready to start game development now. We have a rough plan, and Unity is set up for the job. Let's finally start now.</p></div></div>
