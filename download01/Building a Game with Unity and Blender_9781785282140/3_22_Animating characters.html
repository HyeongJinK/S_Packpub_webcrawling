Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span> tab in the Properties panel and find the <span class="strong"><strong>Frame Rate</strong></span> option. Change the frame rate to <code class="literal">60</code> fps because that's what video games are running at. If you chose another option instead, your animation will seem like it is being played at a very slow speed in the game engine. So, make sure that this option is set before you start animating your character because prevention is better than cure.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_23.jpg" /></div><p>Game animation has adopted a technique from traditional animation named <span class="strong"><strong>key-framing</strong></span>. Key-framing is<a id="id698" class="indexterm"></a> the process of assigning a posture or specific parameter (such as<a id="id699" class="indexterm"></a> position, rotation, and scale) to a character or object at a specific point in time. Each of these key-frames is then processed by the<a id="id700" class="indexterm"></a> computer to generate the in-between frames through a process named <span class="strong"><strong>interpolation</strong></span>. This eliminates the need to animate every single frame, which is a very tedious job.</p><p>There are several ways you can set key-frames to your bones. One of the methods is to tell Blender to automatically assign a new key-frame whenever you make some changes to a bone. This option can be activated by pressing the button with a red dot below the animation timeline. To deactivate it, press the button again.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_24.jpg" /></div><p>However, I would not recommend you use automatic key-framing because despite its convenience, it often makes things worse by automatically recording all your mistakes as well. For example, you might want to do some testing on the rig but you've forgotten to turn off automatic key-framing. Once you've realized, you have already made tons of changes to the bones, which are now all being automatically recorded to the timeline. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>To manually insert a key-frame, press <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> while the bone is still selected. A menu will pop up and ask you which <a id="id701" class="indexterm"></a>parameter(s) need to be saved to the key-frame. This is very flexible as it allows you to save only those parameters that you need.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_25.jpg" /></div><p>Always plan before you animate your character. I personally prefer to draw the poses on paper before touching Blender. This is because I can quickly draw out the poses on paper quickly and instantly decide whether it's a good posture or not, and then make changes without messing around with the software. "Oh, what's the shortcut key for rotation again?"</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_26.jpg" /></div><p>The advantage of having a proper plan for your animations is that you have already done all the brainstorming beforehand and once you're in Blender, you can straightaway lay down the <a id="id702" class="indexterm"></a>key-frames quickly by following your sketches for every key-frame. This really speeds up the work; all you need to do now is make some minor adjustments and focus on the smaller details.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_27.jpg" /></div><p>To adjust the key-frames, split your viewport and change the other half into the animation graph editor. The graph editor controls how key-frames are interpolated. You can adjust the animation curves, which represent parameters that are being interpolated from one key-frame to another. Alternatively, you can also use the NLA editor and dope sheet to adjust your key-frames.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_28.jpg" /></div><p>Regardless of<a id="id703" class="indexterm"></a> which animation editor you're using, the controls are still identical to the 3D view: press <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> to select all or deselect all, press <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> for batch-select, <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> to delete key-frames, <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> to move key-frames, <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> to rotate, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> for scale, and so on.</p></div>
