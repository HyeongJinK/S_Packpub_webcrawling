Tons of effects will be applied to the footage and the overall color and mood will be carefully adjusted to fit the style <a id="id928" class="indexterm"></a>they want. This process is what we <a id="id929" class="indexterm"></a>call <span class="strong"><strong>compositing</strong></span>.</p><p>In video games, a similar process exists at the end of production to enhance the visual quality, as well as to create the intended mood. In Unity, there is no built-in system for you to do this. However, you can download the free Standard Assets pack provided by Unity Technologies at the Unity Asset Store. This package includes image effect scripts that we will be using to <a id="id930" class="indexterm"></a>enhance our game's visuals.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_08_12.jpg" /></div><p>After you have downloaded the Standard Assets package, import it to your Unity project. The package is mixed with some other things that we don't need at the moment, so we will just enable the <code class="literal">Editor</code> folder and the <code class="literal">Effects</code> folder. Then, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button to start importing.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_08_13.jpg" /></div><p>Once you have imported the package to your project, you can now apply the image effects to your game camera by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image Effects</strong></span>. There are numerous<a id="id931" class="indexterm"></a> amounts of image effects that you can find in the <span class="strong"><strong>Image Effects</strong></span> menu, which is divided into several different categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bloom and Glow</strong></span>: This category includes screen effects such as bloom and lens flares. Bloom is the optical effect where light from a bright source appears<a id="id932" class="indexterm"></a> to leak into surrounding objects. It can be used to achieve both a dream-like visual or to enhance realism, depending on how much bloom effect you set to your camera. There are several different types of bloom effects in this category, and one of them also generates anamorphic lens flares to help evoke a cinematic feeling.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Blur</strong></span>: The <a id="id933" class="indexterm"></a>second category consists of screen effects that cause the screen to become blurry. The blur script simply allows you to blur the entire screen, and the motion blur script simulates motion trails when a camera moves.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span>: The <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> category contains several screen effects such as camera <a id="id934" class="indexterm"></a>motion blur, depth of field, tilt shift, vignette, and chromatic aberration. The camera motion blur is an enhancement to the motion blur script in the previous category. This modern approach to motion blur keeps track of every moving object and generates a velocity buffer in order to apply different levels of blurriness to different areas of the screen based on the movement speed of each object, as well as its depth in relation to the camera. The depth of field script simulates the properties of a camera lens by focusing sharply on an object at a specific distance and blurring out other areas that are not in focus. Similarly, the tilt shift effect blurs the screen based on the <a id="id935" class="indexterm"></a>distance to the center, instead of focusing on a certain object in the distance. Lastly, vignette <a id="id936" class="indexterm"></a>and chromatic aberration introduce darkening, blur, and spectral color separation at the edges and corners of the screen to simulate a view through the camera lens, but can also be used to create abstract effects.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Color Adjustments</strong></span>: This category consists of scripts that change the color of the rendered image onscreen. The color correction scripts make adjustments to the hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast of the screen using different methods, such as using color correction curves, ramp texture, or lookup texture. The contrast enhancement script, on the other hand, only changes the contrast of the screen according to the intensity value that you set. Other than that, the gray scale and sepia tone scripts are both used to remap the screen colors to a single set of hue, making the visuals resemble an old photograph. Lastly, the tone mapping script is the process of mapping color values <a id="id937" class="indexterm"></a>from <span class="strong"><strong>HDR</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>high dynamic range</strong></span>) to <span class="strong"><strong>LDR</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>low dynamic range</strong></span>). This enables interesting dynamic <a id="id938" class="indexterm"></a>effects, such as a simulation <a id="id939" class="indexterm"></a>of the natural adaption that happens when entering or leaving a dark tunnel into bright sunlight. Note that tone mapping will only work properly if the used camera is HDR enabled.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Edge Detection</strong></span>: Both the crease shading and edge detection scripts contained in this category are common <span class="strong"><strong>non-photorealistic rendering</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPR</strong></span>) techniques that<a id="id940" class="indexterm"></a> enhance the visibility<a id="id941" class="indexterm"></a> of objects by adding outlines or black edges of variable thickness.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Displacement</strong></span>: This <a id="id942" class="indexterm"></a>contains screen effects that cause distortion to the rendered image, such as fish eye, twirl, and vortex effects.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span>: Screen <a id="id943" class="indexterm"></a>effect scripts such as global fog, screen space ambient occlusion, screen space ambient obscurance, and sun shaft can be found in this category. Global fog, as its name implies, simulates a camera-based exponential fog effect based on world space calculation. Screen space ambient occlusion is an image effect that darkens creases, holes, and surfaces that are close to each other, imitating a real-life scenario where such areas tend to block out or occlude ambient light, and hence they appear darker. Screen space ambient obscurance, on the other hand, is an improvement to the screen space ambient occlusion in terms of quality and speed. Instead of relying on a generated normals buffer, it creates<a id="id944" class="indexterm"></a> the effect on the fly based on depth. Other<a id="id945" class="indexterm"></a> than that, this category also contains the sun shaft effect script. Sun shaft (also known as <span class="strong"><strong>cloud ray</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>god ray</strong></span>) is an image effect that simulates the radial light scattering that arises when a very bright light source is partly obscured.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Noise</strong></span>: This <a id="id946" class="indexterm"></a>consists of camera effects such as noise, grain, and scratches that simulate noise and film grain, which is a typical effect that happens in film, photography, or TV/VCR. </p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Other</strong></span>: This <a id="id947" class="indexterm"></a>contains two scripts: antialiasing and screen overlay. Antialiasing as a post-processing effect offers a set of algorithms designed to give a smoother appearance to graphics. When two areas of different colors adjoin in an image, the shape of the pixels can form a very distinctive <span class="emphasis"><em>staircase</em></span> along the boundary. This<a id="id948" class="indexterm"></a> effect is known as <span class="strong"><strong>aliasing</strong></span>, and hence antialiasing refers to any measure that reduces the effect. There are several different types of antialiasing that you can choose from the script, such as SSAA, NFAA, FXAA II, FXAA III, DLAA, and so on. Each algorithm produces a slightly different result and varies in performance. The screen overlay script, on the other hand, introduces an easy way to blend different kinds of textures over the entire screen to create custom looks or effects. </p></li></ul></div><p>It's very easy to<a id="id949" class="indexterm"></a> apply these effects to your game. All you need to do is add the image effect script to your active game camera and you're done! You can also apply several scripts to the camera at the same time, but do notice that the more effects you have applied to your game camera, the more computational power is needed to generate these effects, which may not work on older computers or mobile phones.</p><p>The following is the result of adding screen space ambient occlusion, bloom, and depth of field effects to my camera; pretty neat!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_08_14.jpg" /></div></div>
