It takes tons of practice to become a good animator. However, if you learn the correct way to work on animations, such as by following a set of rules or principles, it will help you to achieve better results in a short amount of time.</p><p>The following are the<a id="id705" class="indexterm"></a> 12 basic animation principles introduced by traditional hand-drawn animators from Disney back in the 1980's, which is now regarded as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bible of animation</em></span> by animators around the world.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Squash and stretch</strong></span>: Squash <a id="id706" class="indexterm"></a>and stretch is a great way to exaggerate animations and add more appeals to the movement. It can be applied to everything, from a non-living object to a humanoid character. The best example of this is to look at a bouncing ball. As the ball starts to fall, it will stretch out just before impact, and as the ball impacts the ground, it squashes. Then, the ball stretches again as it takes off.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Anticipation</strong></span>: Anticipation is used in animation to get the audience ready for an action which is about to happen. For example, when a character is about to jump, it will squat down<a id="id707" class="indexterm"></a> before making the jumping movement. This not only gets the momentum up, but also allows the audience to know this character is about to move.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Staging</strong></span>: Staging<a id="id708" class="indexterm"></a> refers to the method used to set up the scene to keep the audience focused on the main subject and without getting distracted by other things. Although this principle is not relevant to in-game character animation, it will be really helpful when you work on the in-game cinematics.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Straight ahead action and pose to pose</strong></span>: Straight ahead and pose to pose refers to the two different techniques of animation. With straight ahead, you will create each pose of<a id="id709" class="indexterm"></a> the animation one after another as you are going. With pose to pose, it's much more planned out; the<a id="id710" class="indexterm"></a> most important poses are required to properly inform the actions that are added first to ensure that the posing and timing is correct before adding more details.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Follow through and overlapping action</strong></span>: Follow through is the idea that separate parts of the<a id="id711" class="indexterm"></a> body will continue moving after the character has come to a stop. For <a id="id712" class="indexterm"></a>example, a character may have stopped its footsteps, but the arms will continue to move for a while before settling. Overlapping action means different parts of the body will move at different time and speed, for example, movements in real life.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ease in and ease out</strong></span>: Ease in and ease out is sometimes also referred to as slow in and slow <a id="id713" class="indexterm"></a>out. As an object or character starts<a id="id714" class="indexterm"></a> to move or goes to stop, there needs to be time for acceleration and deceleration to achieve a natural look.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Arc</strong></span>: In real life, almost everything moves in some kind of arcing motion, except robots. In<a id="id715" class="indexterm"></a> order to achieve a natural and realistic movement, you should adhere to the principle of arcs when animating your game character.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Secondary action</strong></span>: Secondary<a id="id716" class="indexterm"></a> action refers to creating actions that support the main action without taking away its attention.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Timing and spacing</strong></span>: Timing <a id="id717" class="indexterm"></a>and spacing in animation is what gives objects and characters the illusion of moving within the laws of physics. The timing refers to the number of frames between two poses. Spacing, on the other hand, refers to how those individual frames are placed. If the spacing is close to the frames, the object moves slower; if the spacing is further apart the object moves faster.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Exaggeration</strong></span>: Exaggeration is used to push movements of a character further and create<a id="id718" class="indexterm"></a> the illusion of the character's weight. Although exaggeration is mostly used to create extremely cartoony movements for stylized animation, it can also be used for realistic animation to make a movement more readable while staying true to reality.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Solid drawing</strong></span>: This principal <a id="id719" class="indexterm"></a>only applies to 2D hand-drawn animation. A solid and accurate drawing is important in 2D animation in keeping the volume and weight of the characters consistent.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Appeal</strong></span>: Appeal is <a id="id720" class="indexterm"></a>probably one of the most important things in animation. Your character design has to look charismatic and fit the character's personality. This holds true for both heroes and villains. Appeal also comes to the movement style of each of the character, which should reflect the uniqueness of that particular character so that it can stick out in the audience's (or player's, in this case) memory.</p></li></ol></div><p>Even though some of the principles are not relevant to 3D in-game animation (such as staging and solid drawing), they might help you in the future when you work on 2D sprite animation or prerendered game cinematics.</p></div>
