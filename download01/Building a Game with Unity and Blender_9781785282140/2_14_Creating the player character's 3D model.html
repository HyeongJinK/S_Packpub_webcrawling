<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"></a>Creating the player character's 3D model</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now that you <a id="id626" class="indexterm"></a>are equipped with all the basic modeling skills, let's move on to create the player character. Phew, we have come such a long way! </p><p>Although a humanoid<a id="id627" class="indexterm"></a> character tends to look very complicated, if we take away the details and just look at its simplified form, what we will see is a bunch of cylindrical shapes stuck together with a spherical head on top. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_51.jpg" /></div><p>That is exactly what we are going to do nextâ€”create a bunch of cylinders and a sphere at a low segments count; I usually go for 6-8 segments so it's easier to edit. Then, arrange the cylinders and sphere nicely so that it look like a stickman.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_52.jpg" /></div><p>Next, join all the shapes together into one single object by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span>. Then, delete the other half of the<a id="id628" class="indexterm"></a> model (only the body part, not the head) and apply the mirror modifier to make our lives easier. Do note that if your object's pivot <a id="id629" class="indexterm"></a>point is not in the middle, your model will look extremely wrong when the mirror modifier is applied.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_53.jpg" /></div><p>To solve this problem, place the 3D cursor at the center of the grid and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Set Origin</strong></span> followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Origin to 3D Cursor</strong></span> on the Tool Shelf. What this does is change the pivot point of the mesh to where the 3D cursor is located. The mirror modifier uses the mesh's pivot point to calculate where to generate and position .the mirrored twin.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_54.jpg" /></div><p>After that, we need to<a id="id630" class="indexterm"></a> delete the faces hidden between the<a id="id631" class="indexterm"></a> cylinders so that later we can merge the cylinders together by welding the vertices.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_55.jpg" /></div><p>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> to make a loop cut around the upper body. Then, make another loop cut in the middle as we are going to make a hole for the arm to connect to the body.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_56.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we will <a id="id632" class="indexterm"></a>merge all the parts together by welding the vertices together. Select two or more vertices and press <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span> followed by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Merge</strong></span> from the menu, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>At First</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>At Last</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>At Center</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>At Cursor</strong></span> to execute the merge operator.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_57.jpg" /></div><p>Once you are done <a id="id633" class="indexterm"></a>merging the vertices, make a few more loop cuts around the model in preparation for modeling the knees and elbows.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_58.jpg" /></div><p>Create the <a id="id634" class="indexterm"></a>knees by joining some of the vertices together and then manually move the vertices until the leg<a id="id635" class="indexterm"></a> looks something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_59.jpg" /></div><p>After that, repeat the same steps to create the shape of the arm.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_60.jpg" /></div><p>Once you're happy<a id="id636" class="indexterm"></a> with the legs and arms, we will move on<a id="id637" class="indexterm"></a> to create the character's head. The shape of a humanoid head is much more complex than other parts of the body. If we look into a mirror, we will realize that our head is in fact more than just a sphere, because there is something called a <span class="emphasis"><em>face</em></span> growing out from the sphere, like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_61.jpg" /></div><p>However, since we are making a low-polygon model, it's simply impossible to replicate the complicated shape of our face. What we can do, however, is to emulate the shape through approximation. In fact, we are going to just move a few vertices in front to make it look like the face of a wrapped mummy.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_62.jpg" /></div><p>Next, adjust the<a id="id638" class="indexterm"></a> vertices at the bottom of the head. Leave some space for<a id="id639" class="indexterm"></a> the jaws and the rest is for the neck.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_63.jpg" /></div><p>Extrude the neck out from the head and weld the vertices to the body. Don't forget to delete any faces that are hidden within the inner side of the model.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_64.jpg" /></div><p>After that, connect <a id="id640" class="indexterm"></a>both the legs together by creating the pubis using <a id="id641" class="indexterm"></a>extrusion. Make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Clipping</strong></span> option is checked on your mirror modifier so that the vertices will not cross to the other side.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_65.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we will create the feet through a combination of loop-cutting and extrusion. First, make a loop cut at the bottom of the leg. Then, extrude the faces in front followed by merging the top vertices <a id="id642" class="indexterm"></a>with the bottom to make it look like a foot.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_66.jpg" /></div><p>Once you're done with that, extrude the front part of the arm several times and manually adjust the shape of the fist. If<a id="id643" class="indexterm"></a> you're unsure about what a fist looks like, try to look at yours!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_67.jpg" /></div><p>Then, we will create the sleeve using extrusion. Try to separate the vertices of the arm that connect to the shirt. It will cause Z-fighting problems later in the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_68.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip15"></a>Tip</h3><p>Z-fighting is a visual artifact that <a id="id644" class="indexterm"></a>occurs when two or more polygons are occupying the same space, causing the polygons to <span class="emphasis"><em>fight</em></span> among themselves to determine who should be rendered on the screen, resulting in a flickering effect.</p></div><p>Next, we will create the <a id="id645" class="indexterm"></a>hem of the shirt. This part<a id="id646" class="indexterm"></a> requires more work as the shape is much more complicated. Try not to use a transparent texture for this purpose, or should I say, try not to use any transparent textures in your game whenever possible. That's because transparency sorting requires comparing the depth between each pixel, which will impact the performance of your game; use it only at a minimum.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_69.jpg" /></div><p>After you have done the hem, let's move on to the visor. It's a very simple shape that can be done using a plane. Create <a id="id647" class="indexterm"></a>a plane by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span> followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Plane</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_70.jpg" /></div><p>After that, create the pivot <a id="id648" class="indexterm"></a>of the visor by simply adding a cylinder shape and scale it down.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_71.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we're going to create the ears. Just like how we did the ears of the monster, we first select the faces of the face (no pun intended) and extrude it one time without moving its position, then scale it down<a id="id649" class="indexterm"></a> roughly to the size of an ear. After that, extrude it a few times and manually move the<a id="id650" class="indexterm"></a> vertices to make it look like an ear. After the ear is done, I also adjusted the edges of the face to reduce shading distortion and make it look better.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_72.jpg" /></div><p>Then, we will be making the features on the helmet. This is also done using just planes.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_73.jpg" /></div><p>Next, I created a sword <a id="id651" class="indexterm"></a>from a box using a combination of loop-cutting, extrusion, and<a id="id652" class="indexterm"></a> moving vertices around.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_74.jpg" /></div><p>After a lot of time and effort, we finally get this splendid result!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_75.jpg" /></div></div>
