<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec45"></a>Creating character attributes</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In the <a id="id888" class="indexterm"></a>previous chapter, we learned how to create a lively in-game character that is able to move around based on the player's input. However, this is not enough to make your game fun and addictive. There is no standard definition on what makes a game fun. However, by observing successful titles that have been proven (from the sales figure) to be fun, we can easily find one similarity between these games—they all have a well-planned progression throughout the game.</p><p>The key behind a good progression is to let the players learn and improve their playing skill over time while facing greater challenges in every new level. Besides this, players should also be given larger rewards to solve a difficult puzzle or quest, which creates a satisfactory feeling that will keep the player coming back for bigger rewards.</p><p>Game rewards can be divided into several different types and categories. One of the most familiar is the player's level. Every level up will increase the strength, speed, or other attribute of the player character, and hence allowing it to challenge stronger enemies. Besides this, one of the other types of reward is to give in-game items to the player, such as a new weapon, new equipment, and so on, which also increases the attributes of the player character. This not only makes it stronger but also changes the outlook of the character.</p><p>Another <a id="id889" class="indexterm"></a>type of reward is unlocking features that are hidden away from the player before he/she has reached a certain level or achieved a specific goal. Examples of locked features are special skills, extra movements (double jump, dash, and so on), or special ability that allows the player to enter a path that he/she wouldn't be able to do so previously—for example, crossing a broken bridge by unlocking the flying ability.</p><p>To create player attributes in Unity, first let's create the C# script named <code class="literal">PlayerAttribute.cs</code>. This script only serves as a container for the attributes and contains no logic in it.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class PlayerAttribute : MonoBehaviour
{
  public int level = 1;
  public float healthPoint = 100;
  public float manaPoint = 0;
  public float attackDamage = 10;
  public float specialAttackDamage = 50;
  public float defense = 2;
}</pre></div><p>The preceding code is pretty self-explanatory. The script is used to save the player's attributes, such as level, health point, hit point, and so on. Other scripts will have to access this script if it needs the player's attributes. I will try to explain this by adjusting the <code class="literal">PlayerAttack.cs</code> script that we created in the previous chapter. Since we have already accessed the <code class="literal">attackDamage</code> (hit point) attribute from the <code class="literal">PlayerAttribute</code> script, we can now remove this variable:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public float attackDamage = 10;</pre></div><p>Replace it with the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public PlayerAttribute playerAttr;</pre></div><p>After this, have a look at the following line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(nearbyEnemy[i] as GameObject).GetComponent&lt;EnemyAI&gt;().GetDamage(attackDamage);</pre></div><p>Change the preceding line to the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">(nearbyEnemy[i] as GameObject).GetComponent&lt;EnemyAI&gt;().GetDamage(playerAttr.attackDamage);</pre></div><p>We have just removed the local variable <code class="literal">attackDamage</code> completely. When the player is trying to attack<a id="id890" class="indexterm"></a> the monster enemy, the <code class="literal">playerAttack</code> script will use the <code class="literal">attackDamage</code> variable in the <code class="literal">playerAttribute</code> script instead.</p></div>
