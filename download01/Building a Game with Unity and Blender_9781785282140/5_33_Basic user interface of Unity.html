<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec35"></a>Basic user interface of Unity</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>First of all, let's take a look<a id="id772" class="indexterm"></a> at its user interface. Unity's user interface is much simpler when compared with Blender because Blender is complex software that allows you to do so many things, including modeling, texturing, sculpting, rigging, animation, tracking, and <a id="id773" class="indexterm"></a>compositing. However, Unity is software that focuses only on game-related functionality. Therefore, you can't edit the 3D models in Unity but instead have to import them from 3D modeling software like Blender.</p><p>Without wasting much time, let's take a look at Unity's user interface, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_05_01.jpg" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Toolbars</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>): Here lies the application menu toolbar as well as a simple navigation toolbar located below it. There are three special buttons located in the middle of the <a id="id774" class="indexterm"></a>navigation toolbar, which are unique to Unity. When the play button is pressed, you will instantly enter to the game mode and will start testing your game. To exit from the game mode, simply <a id="id775" class="indexterm"></a>press the stop button. This allows you to quickly test your game repeatedly and iterate the game variables to make sure that your game is balanced.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>): This is<a id="id776" class="indexterm"></a> where all the objects in the scene are listed. The list also shows the parent-child relationship between<a id="id777" class="indexterm"></a> objects, and it allows you to change the relationship by simply selecting the object from the list and dragging it to another object.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scene View and Game View</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span>): The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel is where you edit your game scene, and the <a id="id778" class="indexterm"></a>Game panel is where you test your game. When the play button is pressed, Unity will automatically switch over to the game panel and then back to the scene panel again when you pressed the stop button.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project Browser</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span>): The Project <a id="id779" class="indexterm"></a>Browser displays all the assets in your project. This panel splits into two sides: on the left, we have the directory hierarchy and when you click on one of the folders, the<a id="id780" class="indexterm"></a> assets contained in the selected folder will be shown to the right of the panel.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span>): When an object from the scene is selected, the object's components and properties <a id="id781" class="indexterm"></a>will be shown in this <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. You can add/remove components or change its properties on this panel.</p></li></ul></div><p>Unity provides more <a id="id782" class="indexterm"></a>panels/windows than what we have just introduced. However, the other panels are being hidden by default. You can unhide them by going to the menu toolbar and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> and select the panel you want to unhide. By default, when you open up a new panel, it will appear as an individual window. You can join the window with other existing panels by clicking on the window's <span class="strong"><strong>Header</strong></span> tab and dragging it to the side of the other panels that you want it to join together with. Then, release<a id="id783" class="indexterm"></a> your mouse and see the window disappear and turn into a panel instead, being located side by side with the other panels. Unity's user interface is very flexible and able to fit to your preferences.</p></div>
