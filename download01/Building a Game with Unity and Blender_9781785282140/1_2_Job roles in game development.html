Specialized roles like these are normally only available in big studios, which have the resources to ensure that every aspect of the game they are creating is at its highest standard.</p><p>For a smaller game development team, an individual team member can handle multiple roles, and more than one person can share some roles in order to split the workloads.</p></div>
