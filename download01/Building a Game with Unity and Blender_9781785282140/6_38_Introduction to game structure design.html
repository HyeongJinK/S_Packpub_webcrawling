This, in turn, has made the game development process even more complicated as game programmers are no longer the ones who also design the game mechanics or the ones who decide the storyline.</p><p>Therefore, game <a id="id837" class="indexterm"></a>developers had to find a way to streamline the development workflow so that both the designers and programmers could communicate more closely to make sure that there is no conflict between the game design and technical implementation during the production stage. This resulted in an emphasis on the importance of game structure design during the pre-production stage. From the game structure, developers will be able to see the bigger picture and point out possible improvements for the game before they start implementing it.</p><p>Game structure consists of several different categories, including the flow of the user interface, finite state machine, game mechanics design, decision-making chart for AI, and so on. Before we even start writing any game code, we should first of all plan the flow of our game: how the game should behave, starting from the moment it's launched; what should happen next; whether to display a cinematic before proceeding to the main menu; what the enemies do when they have detected the presence of the player, and so on. From there, we<a id="id838" class="indexterm"></a> break down the structures into different subcategories and start designing it using a flow chart.</p><p>There are plenty of free tools out there that can be used to draw the flow charts, such as OpenOffice, LibreOffice, draw.io, Gliffy, and so on. Pick the tool that is most suited to you.</p></div>
