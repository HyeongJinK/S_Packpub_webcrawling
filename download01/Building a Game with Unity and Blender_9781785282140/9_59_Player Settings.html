For instance, the game title has not been set, the game icon is showing the Unity logo, and several other things are not to your liking. Don't worry! This is because the player settings have not been properly configured.</p><p>To open up the player settings window, you can either go to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span>, or go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_05.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"></a>Tip</h3><p>Do note that the word <span class="strong"><strong>player</strong></span> in this context does not mean the person who plays the game, but rather the system that runs the game and renders the graphics; in other words, the player application that is the build output.</p></div><p>You will see two different sections on the player settings window. The top section is the general settings of your game, such as your company name, product name, game icon, and so on. These settings are shared among the different platforms.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span>: The name <a id="id988" class="indexterm"></a>of your company. It will be used to locate the preferences file.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span>: This will be displayed as the window title for the PC game or the display name below the icon for the mobile app. It will also be used to locate the preferences file.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Default Icon</strong></span>: The default icon for your game on every platform. You can also override this for <a id="id989" class="indexterm"></a>specific platforms.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Default Cursor</strong></span>: The default cursor of your game.

These settings are categorized into several different categories, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution and Presentation</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Icon</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Splash Image</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Other Settings</strong></span>. Each of these categories<a id="id992" class="indexterm"></a> contains very different options depending on your target platform.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_06.jpg" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

<span class="strong"><strong>Debugging and Crash Reporting (iOS only)</strong></span>: This is an additional category for iOS related to debugging and crash reporting. You can set whether to log an uncaught <a id="id994" class="indexterm"></a>exception in Objective-C, enable the CrashReport API, whether to silently exit or crash the game if there is an unhandled exception in .Net, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Publishing Settings (Android only)</strong></span>: <span class="strong"><strong>Publishing Settings</strong></span> is an additional category for Android that is used to <a id="id995" class="indexterm"></a>set the keystore for your application before publishing it to the play store.
