Well, we can place crystals all <a id="id763" class="indexterm"></a>over the level, which will emit different colors of light, but that sounds like a lazy solution to me; besides, aren't most other games out there doing the same thing? I thought we could go for something different, so instead of shiny crystals, I decided to place a bunch of grass around the level instead.</p><p>First of all, grass can still grow underground provided that there are holes on the ceiling that allow the sunlight to enter underground. Second, this allows us to play around with the lighting to make the underground level look more interesting, and finally, by combining a green color with brown, we achieved color harmonic for this level, and that will definitely enhance the visual quality of this game due to the fact that these two colors are complementary colors on the color wheel. Complementary colors are any two colors that are directly opposite each other, such as red and green, red and purple, as well as yellow and green. When a pair of opposite colors is placed next to each other, it creates some striking optical effects whereby both colors cancel each other out, resulting in what we called <span class="strong"><strong>color harmonic</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information regarding complementary colors and color harmonies, search for basic color theory on a search engine.</p></div><p>The process of building a grass model is actually much easier than you would have imagined. Until this day, game developers around the world, including the AAA studios, are still using this same old technique to create the illusion of living grass in their gamesâ€”using a bunch of planes and intersecting them in random directions. This technique is not perfect, of course, but so far, it's the best method, which is well-balanced between visual quality and performance.</p><p>To create a grass <a id="id764" class="indexterm"></a>model in Blender, start with a plane, scale it<a id="id765" class="indexterm"></a> slightly using the <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> key, and then duplicate the plane several times using <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> and rotate all the planes using the <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> key to cover all different directions. You can slowly adjust the planes' rotation again after applying texture to the model because it's easier to examine the result with texture on it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_13.jpg" /></div><p>Before we're done with the grass model, combine all the planes into a single object by selecting all the planes and then pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span>. Then, duplicate the grass model and flip the normals of the duplicated mesh by entering Edit mode, and then select all the faces and go to <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Normals</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Flip Normals</strong></span> from the 3D View Menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_14.jpg" /></div><p>The reason we do this is because in the game engine, only one side of the polygon will be rendered, unlike in Blender where both sides will be rendered. To address this issue, we have duplicated the <a id="id766" class="indexterm"></a>entire mesh and flipped the normals of the<a id="id767" class="indexterm"></a> duplicated mesh so that the other side of the polygon is also being rendered when the model is imported to the game engine.</p></div>
