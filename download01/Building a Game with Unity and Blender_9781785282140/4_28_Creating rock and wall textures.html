However, without any <a id="id750" class="indexterm"></a>textures, the players will not be able to tell what they actually resemble. Therefore, texturing is a very important step that helps to enhance the visual identity of a 3D object.</p><p>There are different ways<a id="id751" class="indexterm"></a> to create a texture, depending on the art style you're after. For this game demo, I chose a semi-realistic <a id="id752" class="indexterm"></a>environment art style, so I will be using photos to create all my environment textures. If you chose a cartoony style instead of realistic, you will need to manually paint your own texture. You can still make use of these photos but only as a<a id="id753" class="indexterm"></a> reference for painting. Since the terrain, walls, and rocks belong to the same environment, logically, they all belong to the same type of mineral species. Therefore, we just need to create one single texture and reuse it for all the different 3D models. This not only makes the 3D assets look visually identical, but also increases your game's performance, which will be discussed in a later chapter.</p><p>In the following example, I used three different photos to create my final texture. Each of the photos contributes a very different level of detail to the final texture: an extremely rough surface with big cracks, a medium surface with decent bumpiness, and a fine surface with tiny poles. When you combine all of these different layers of detail into one, you will create a rather interesting looking texture, which is both rich in details but also harmonic to the eyes.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_10.jpg" /></div><p>Then, I made<a id="id754" class="indexterm"></a> the texture seamless so that it can be tiled on large models such as the terrain and walls. Different image editing software does this differently; if you're using Photoshop, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Filter</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Offset</strong></span> to make your <a id="id755" class="indexterm"></a>texture offset a certain amount<a id="id756" class="indexterm"></a> of pixels. After this, use either the Healing Brush or Stamp Tool to remove the texture<a id="id757" class="indexterm"></a> seam and you're almost done. Finally, since I'm going for a semi-realistic style, I have also adjusted the color of the texture and made it slightly more saturated to fit in with the cartoony characters.</p><p>Now I can apply the same textures to all the different rocks, and they will all look equally awesome!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_11.jpg" /></div><p>For the terrain <a id="id758" class="indexterm"></a>and walls, however, you will note that<a id="id759" class="indexterm"></a> there are some repeating patterns when your camera is far away. Also, it looks super ugly <a id="id760" class="indexterm"></a>and flat at this<a id="id761" class="indexterm"></a> moment! Don't worry about this for now, though, as awesomeness will prevail after we add some lights and decals to the scene in a later chapter. Be patient. For now, it's all good.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_12.jpg" /></div></div>
