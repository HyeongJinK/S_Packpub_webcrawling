This is also a lot easier than you might have thought. First of all, using your choice of image editing software, draw<a id="id769" class="indexterm"></a> out the shape of a clump using just plain color. You can use any tools you like, such as the paint tool, lasso tool, pen tool, and so on. It also doesn't need to be extremely accurate because we're going for a semi-realistic style. After you are done with the shape, apply a gradient color to it: darker green at the bottom and lighter green on top. Next, overlay a leaf texture on top of it to add some subtle details to the texture. </p><p>Then, you're done!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_15.jpg" /></div><p>You can now <a id="id770" class="indexterm"></a>apply the texture to the grass model and adjust the<a id="id771" class="indexterm"></a> planes again until you're satisfied.
