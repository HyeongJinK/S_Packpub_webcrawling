These colors represent the skin weight values of the vertices<a id="id694" class="indexterm"></a> associated with a particular bone. You can try to select a different vertex group and see the colors changing. This is because you're now viewing the skin weight values associated with another bone.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_18.jpg" /></div><p>To change the value of the skin weights, we can <span class="emphasis"><em>paint</em></span> the values using our mouse cursor. To change the size of the brush, go to the Tool Shelf and you will see the <span class="strong"><strong>radius</strong></span> property under the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush</strong></span> section. There are also some other options that you can set, such as the types of brushes, weight value, strength of the brush, blending mode, and so on and so forth. </p><p>There are also some advanced settings below it, but we will skip those for now.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_19.jpg" /></div><p>To make the skin more fluid and less robotic when animating, make sure that each bone has some <a id="id695" class="indexterm"></a>minor influence over the neighboring vertices beside the ones that are fully under its control. This will create slight stretches to the neighboring vertices when moving the bone, and this will create the illusion that the object is organic.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_20.jpg" /></div><p>You may also note some visual artifacts when moving some of the bones. This happens because some of the vertices are not assigned to a vertex group due to carelessness. This problem can also be fixed by applying a full weight value to the vertices using the brush tool.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_21.jpg" /></div><p>Play around with weight painting until there are no major problems occurring with your rig. Rigging and skinning are both <a id="id696" class="indexterm"></a>very time consuming, but they're fun to work on once you're used to them!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_22.jpg" /></div></div>
