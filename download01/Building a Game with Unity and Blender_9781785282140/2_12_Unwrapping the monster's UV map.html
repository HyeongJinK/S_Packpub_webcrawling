Click and drag<a id="id599" class="indexterm"></a> the split-window widget located in the top-right corner of your 3D view to split open a new window. Choose <span class="strong"><strong>UV/Image Editor</strong></span> from the<a id="id600" class="indexterm"></a> editor type drop-down menu and now you will see the UV editor alongside your 3D view.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_31.jpg" /></div><p>The first step to UV unwrapping is to find out where to cut out the seams. First, select the edges that connect the ears and legs to the body.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_32.jpg" /></div><p>Then, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> to open up the menu containing all operators related to edges. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Mark Seam</strong></span> to tell Blender to <a id="id601" class="indexterm"></a>cut these edges when we unwrap the UV<a id="id602" class="indexterm"></a> map. The edges will then be marked with thick red lines.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_33.jpg" /></div><p>After that, mark all the other seam lines with the same method. Try to mark the edges that are hard to notice from the player's view so that any visual artifacts that might happen along the seam lines can be well hidden. Next I have highlighted the seam lines that I applied to the monster using white lines so that you can refer to it. Notice how I try to flatten the face UV as much as possible to minimize texture distortion on the face.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_34.jpg" /></div><p>When you're done marking<a id="id603" class="indexterm"></a> the seam lines, press <span class="emphasis"><em>U</em></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unwrap</strong></span>. Blender <a id="id604" class="indexterm"></a>will automatically unwrap the UV map based on the seam lines that you set beforehand. However, it's not done yet.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_35.jpg" /></div><p>We need to check whether the UVs are being unwrapped correctly by using a checker texture. Under the UV editor <a id="id605" class="indexterm"></a>window, click the <span class="strong"><strong>+ New</strong></span> button and a dialog box will appear. Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Generated Type</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>UV Grid</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_36.jpg" /></div><p>A checker texture will <a id="id606" class="indexterm"></a>now be applied to your 3D model, but you still won't be able to see it until you change the 3D view's <span class="strong"><strong>Viewport Shading</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> mode.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_37.jpg" /></div><p>You will now see the checker texture being wrapped around the monster. This way, any distortions can be noticed and fixed easily. If the distortions happen at the area that can hardly be noticed by the<a id="id607" class="indexterm"></a> player, then it's OK to just ignore it provided it's not causing any serious artifacts.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_38.jpg" /></div><p>After that, we will arrange<a id="id608" class="indexterm"></a> the UV islands so that it occupies most of the empty spaces on the texture. The first thing I usually do is to move all the UV islands outside the map area and slowly move it inside the map one by one. It's proven to be quite a clean and efficient way to arrange UV islands because you won't get distracted by other islands while doing the placement.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_39.jpg" /></div><p>UV editing in Blender is exactly the same as editing a 3D model: right-click on the area to select a point, press <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> to batch select, <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> to move things around, <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> for rotation, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> for scale, and so on. The workflow remains unchanged even though we're in a different type of window doing a different task.</p><p>It may take some time to properly arrange all the UV islands. While doing it, you might find issues related to the seam lines and require a re-unwrap. Try to correct the UV as much as possible at<a id="id609" class="indexterm"></a> this point to avoid problems occurring during the texturing stage.</p><p>The following screenshot <a id="id610" class="indexterm"></a>shows the final UV map for the monster. We can now export the UV map by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>UVs</strong></span> menu below the UV editor window and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Export UV Layout</strong></span>. Export the UV map to your computer and let's move on to texturing!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_40.jpg" /></div></div>
