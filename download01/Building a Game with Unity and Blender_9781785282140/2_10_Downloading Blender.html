But in this tutorial, we will be using another Blender, which is an open source 3D computer graphics software developed and maintained by the Blender Foundation.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>You can download Blender for<a id="id534" class="indexterm"></a> free, at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/download" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org/download</a>.</p></div><p>Currently, three platforms are officially supported: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Due to Blender's open source nature, it can be easily ported to other operating systems as well.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"></a>A brief history of Blender</h3></div></div></div><p>Blender was originally proprietary software developed in the mid 90's by Ton Roosendaal for his<a id="id535" class="indexterm"></a> animation company. Unfortunately, the company was shut down by investors in early 2002, resulting in Ton losing the ownership of Blender.</p><p>Later that year, Ton founded a non-profit organization called the Blender Foundation and successfully raised a total of 100,000 EUR in only seven weeks to convince the former company investors to agree on open-sourcing Blender.</p><p>On Sunday, October <a id="id536" class="indexterm"></a>13, 2002, Blender was released to the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Blender development has continued to thrive since that day, driven by an ever-growing team of dedicated volunteers from around the world led by Blender's original creator, Ton Roosendaal.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"></a>The basic user interface of Blender</h3></div></div></div><p>After installing Blender to<a id="id537" class="indexterm"></a> your computer, double-click on the Blender icon located either on the desktop or the Start menu to launch the program. You will see something<a id="id538" class="indexterm"></a> like this once Blender is launched:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_01.jpg" /></div><p>At the time of writing this book, the latest stable release of Blender is version 2.74. You might be seeing a different splash screen if you are using a different version of Blender, which is completely normal.</p><p>You can also switch off the splash screen by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>User Preferences</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Interface</strong></span> and untick the <span class="strong"><strong>Show Splash</strong></span> option.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>Blender has a completely unique user interface, which is quite different from any other 3D programs out<a id="id539" class="indexterm"></a> there. Next I have labeled the panels that form the default <a id="id540" class="indexterm"></a>Blender workspace and briefly explain what each of these panels is used for:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_03.jpg" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Header menu</strong></span> (1): The Header menu is<a id="id541" class="indexterm"></a> a rectangular panel on the top that provides you with access to application-specific functions such as opening a project file, saving a file, importing/exporting data, user preferences settings, toggling the window full screen, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Tool Shelf</strong></span> (2): The Tools<a id="id542" class="indexterm"></a> shelf is a panel containing shortcuts to frequently used operators such as buttons for creating and editing 3D meshes, animation, and physics tools, as <a id="id543" class="indexterm"></a>well as quick access to the grease pencil.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Operator window</strong></span> (3): The <span class="strong"><strong>Operator</strong></span> window displays properties related to an operation that you <a id="id544" class="indexterm"></a>have just used, such as adding primitives, applying a rigid body to an object, and so on. If an operator does not have any properties, the <span class="strong"><strong>Operator</strong></span> panel will be empty.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The 3D view menu</strong></span> (4): The 3D view menu is where you can access menus related to the 3D view, such <a id="id545" class="indexterm"></a>as adjusting the view and adding/selecting/manipulating objects in the scene. You will be using this menu all the time if you don't remember the shortcut keys.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Animation timeline</strong></span> (5): The Animation timeline is where you adjust your animation's key frames <a id="id546" class="indexterm"></a>and curves. You can also find the <span class="strong"><strong>Playback</strong></span> button here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Main 3D view</strong></span> (6): The main 3D view is a window that displays your 3D scene in real time for<a id="id547" class="indexterm"></a> editing purposes. You will be doing all your work here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Properties window</strong></span> (7): The <a id="id548" class="indexterm"></a>Properties window displays the properties of the current selected object. You can also adjust the render settings here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Outliner window</strong></span> (8): The Outliner window displays the list of objects in your 3D scene. You can<a id="id549" class="indexterm"></a> select an object by simply clicking on it on the Outliner instead of selecting it in the main 3D view.</p></li></ul></div><p>Blender's user interface is highly customizable, which means you can modify the workspace layout to fit your purposes. Every window can be moved, scaled, split, and combined. You will find a split-window widget either on the top-right corner or the bottom-left corner of every window. Clicking and dragging the widget inward will cause the window to split in half, whereas dragging it outward will make it combine with another window nearby. You can pick which window you want it to combine with by moving the mouse in different directions while holding the left mouse button. A big arrow will appear on the screen to indicate which window will be removed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_04.jpg" /></div><p>After you have<a id="id550" class="indexterm"></a> customized your desired layout, you can save it by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> button besides the screen data block on the Header menu. You can easily switch between different layouts by choosing from the screen data block drop-down menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_05.jpg" /></div><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> window, you will see a row of buttons that look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_06.jpg" /></div><p>The icons will look different depending on the type of object selected in 3D view. Each of these buttons gives you access to a<a id="id551" class="indexterm"></a> different context of the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> settings, such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span>: All the settings<a id="id552" class="indexterm"></a> that control the rendering of the final images, such as the resolution, output format, performance, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Render layers</strong></span>: Settings <a id="id553" class="indexterm"></a>of each layer/render pass that get processed by the rendering engine to produce the final images.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>: Here lie the<a id="id554" class="indexterm"></a> settings for color management, camera choice for rendering, and units and gravity settings for physical modeling.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span>: These are the<a id="id555" class="indexterm"></a> settings for the surrounding environment of which the models are rendered, such as background sky color, mist and star settings and environment lighting.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Object</strong></span>: In here are<a id="id556" class="indexterm"></a> settings that apply to all kinds of objects, such as transformations, layer assignments, and grouping. The settings shown here apply to the current selected object.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Object constraints</strong></span>: These are the settings that limit the motion of the object for animation purposes. The<a id="id557" class="indexterm"></a> limits can also be tied to the motion of other objects in various ways.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Object modifiers</strong></span>: Modifiers are<a id="id558" class="indexterm"></a> components that make changes to the geometry which only take effect at rendering time. Lamps, cameras, and empty objects can't have modifiers.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Object data</strong></span>: Here you will find <a id="id559" class="indexterm"></a>settings specific to the type of object: mesh vertex groupings, text font, lamp settings, camera settings, and so on. This is reflected in the icon, which changes according to the type of object selected.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>: The material settings for an object control how it looks: its color, whether it has a shiny <a id="id560" class="indexterm"></a>or dull surface, how transparent it is, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>: Textures are the <a id="id561" class="indexterm"></a>graphical skins laid atop 3D models so they appear to have surface detail. The texture settings allow you to change the texture of a material or modify the properties of the texture.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Particle</strong></span>: The <span class="strong"><strong>Particle</strong></span> setting<a id="id562" class="indexterm"></a> is used to change the way a set of particles behave, producing effects like smoke, flames, or sparks.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span>: Here you<a id="id563" class="indexterm"></a> will find settings that control how the object reacts to forces like objects in the real world.</p></li></ul></div><p>Most of these contexts are not really relevant to the game, so we can ignore them for the time being. Since we only use Blender for creating models and animations, we will only use the Object and Object<a id="id564" class="indexterm"></a> modifiers settings most of the time.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information regarding the user interface, you can check out Blender's user manual by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manual</strong></span> on the Header menu and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Editors</strong></span>.</p></div></div></div>
