Props like this add variation to the<a id="id746" class="indexterm"></a> level and hide texture seams on both the terrain and tunnel wall. We will get into this later on.</p><p>The easiest way to build a<a id="id747" class="indexterm"></a> rock model is to start from a cube, and then slowly refine the shape using the loop-cut and knife tool. The knife tool is a handy tool in Blender that is used to split polygons into pieces. A user can initiate the knife tool by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span>, and can define the cutting line by first clicking at the beginning of the line, followed by clicking on where you want the line to end.</p><p>In the following example, a cube is created using <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and then going to <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>. Then, enter Edit mode by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab,</em></span> and then press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> to initiate the Loop Cut tool. With this tool, cut the cube twice in two different directions and adjust the vertices manually to make it look more rounded. After this, use the knife tool by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span> and cut out the top part into a shape of a rock.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_08.jpg" /></div><p>Do make sure that all the faces are either quads or triangles because any surfaces that consist of more than four vertices might cause a problem when the model is imported to the game engine. To <a id="id748" class="indexterm"></a>avoid this problem, select all the faces and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> to triangulate all faces or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span> if you want to convert<a id="id749" class="indexterm"></a> them into quads instead of triangles.</p><p>Do note that most of the game engines, including the Unity Engine, which we're using in this book, prefer triangle faces instead of quad. However, when you export the mesh to the FBX format, the exporter will usually automatically convert the quads into triangles. This process does come with a risk because the exporter will decide on its own which direction the triangles should be when converting the faces, which might cause problems in parts of your model that will be deformed during animation, such as the elbow or the wrist. The best practice is to manually convert the faces of those critical parts into triangles while leaving the rest as quads. This way, your model will be easy to view in Blender, with less wireframe showing on screen, while keeping the topology correct for deformation.</p><p>Next, you can turn these rocks into larger boulder, by deleting the bottom surface and applying a mirror modifier to it. By using the preceding methods, you can easily create different types of rocks and make your level look more interesting.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_04_09.jpg" /></div></div>
