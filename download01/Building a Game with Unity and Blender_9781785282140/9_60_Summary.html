This has totally changed the landscape of game development, where smaller game developer teams are now able to publish their games for multiple platforms without worrying about the budget and technical know-how. On the other hand, big studios can also take advantage of this to reduce development risk and gain more sales to cover their enormous development costs.</p><p>We have now come to the end of the book. I hope you have gained the sufficient knowledge and acquired the skills to kickstart your first game project! I sincerely apologize if you think there is anything that I could have done better or if there is anything you feel is lacking in the book. Do contact me if there is. All the best!</p></div>
