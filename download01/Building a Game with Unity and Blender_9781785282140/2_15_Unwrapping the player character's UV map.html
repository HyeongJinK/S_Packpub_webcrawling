Next I have highlighted the seams I marked on the character model using white lines. Since I used the mirror modifier on this model (except the feathers), most of the UV islands only appear in half, which means the<a id="id654" class="indexterm"></a> other side of the mesh is sharing the exact UV space with the original mesh. This saves a lot of UV space, thus allowing us to enlarge all the UV islands that enable us to display the finer details of the texture.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_76.jpg" /></div><p>For this character, I'm more focusing on the face and torso's UVs because those areas have more important details than other parts of the mesh. I manually straighten the UVs of these two parts <a id="id655" class="indexterm"></a>so that I can more easily create the<a id="id656" class="indexterm"></a> texture without worrying about stretches and distortions. I wasn't too concerned about the other parts that have no details but only flat colors. Focus on the parts that really matter.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_77.jpg" /></div><p>Before I start creating the texture for this character, I bake the ambient occlusion map just like we did previously when creating the monster's 3D model. Due to the complexity of this character in both the mesh structure as well as the shared UV map, quite a few visual artifacts occurred on the AO map. This, however, is not really a big issue as we can fix it later in the image editing software when creating the texture.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_78.jpg" /></div><p>After that, put both the UV map and AO map into the image editing software and place them into separate layers. Then, set the AO map layer's <span class="strong"><strong>Blend</strong></span> mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiply</strong></span>. The rest is entirely up to your own creativity.</p><p>When I was working <a id="id657" class="indexterm"></a>on the character's texture, I forgot the<a id="id658" class="indexterm"></a> face and body are both mirrored and thus unable to draw the hair and sword belt onto the texture map. To solve this problem, I created the hair and sword belt using polygons instead, which turns out pretty well. The following is what the character looks like after applying the texture!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_79.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip16"></a>Tip</h3><p>To learn more<a id="id659" class="indexterm"></a> about the hotkeys available in Blender, download<a id="id660" class="indexterm"></a> the Blender Hotkey Reference document at the following link: <a class="ulink" href="http://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderHotkeyReference.pdf" target="_blank">http://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderHotkeyReference.pdf</a>.</p></div></div>
