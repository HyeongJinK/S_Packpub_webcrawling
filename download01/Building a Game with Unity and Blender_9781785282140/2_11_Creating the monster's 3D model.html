Once you have learned how to do that, you can then try to draw your own concepts and turn it into a 3D model!</p><p>You may ask why we <a id="id566" class="indexterm"></a>start constructing the monster first, and not the player character. The reason for this is because the body shape of the monster is much simpler compared to the player character. Constructing a humanoid 3D model is not the best way for a newbie to learn the basics of 3D modeling. We will come back to the player character once you have mastered the basic skills.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to refer back to our monster concept art and try to imagine its body shape using just the combination of primitive geometries. This will help you see through the complexity of details such as texture, color, facial expression, and so on, and focus solely on the shape. This will help you in planning the steps needed to build the mesh.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>Although most of the time a 3D model can be constructed from a cube, in this case (the preceding image) the<a id="id567" class="indexterm"></a> monster's body is an oval shape and it's easier to build with a sphere. Therefore, the first thing we need to do is to delete the cube that is<a id="id568" class="indexterm"></a> placed by Blender into the scene by default. First, select the cube by pressing the right mouse button. Next, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> key (or the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key) on your keyboard and a confirmation dialog will appear. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span> option on the dialog or press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key to execute the delete operator. Now, the cube is gone. Hooray!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_08.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"></a>Tip</h3><p>Unlike any other 3D programs, Blender uses the right mouse button for object selection instead of the left mouse button.</p></div><p>Now, you may have already noticed the little red-and-white striped circle with black crosshairs that changes its position whenever you left-clicked on the screen. It's called the 3D cursor, which is quite a unique feature not seen in any other 3D modeling tool. Most of the time, the<a id="id569" class="indexterm"></a> 3D cursor is used for placement, whereby a newly created object will be placed exactly <a id="id570" class="indexterm"></a>at the location of the 3D cursor. Besides that, it can also be used as the median point for translation, rotation, and scaling, as well as changing the pivot point of a mesh. You can read<a id="id571" class="indexterm"></a> more about the usage of the 3D cursor in the Blender Reference Manual at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.blender.org/manual/editors/3dview/3d_cursor.html" target="_blank">https://www.blender.org/manual/editors/3dview/3d_cursor.html</a>.</p><p>Next, we want to add a new object. To do that, you can either use the buttons in the Tools Shelf or simply press <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. Select <span class="strong"><strong>UV Sphere</strong></span> and now you will see a sphere that resembles a disco ball appearing in the scene. But before you do anything else, lower down the <span class="strong"><strong>Segments</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Rings</strong></span> values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Operator</strong></span> window so that the number of polygons is reduced. You must do this right after the object is being created because you won't be able to set the properties again once you execute other operators.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_09.jpg" /></div><p>While the sphere is still being selected, go to the Tool Shelf and find the <span class="strong"><strong>Smooth</strong></span> button under the <span class="strong"><strong>Shading</strong></span> category. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Smooth</strong></span> button and now you get a pretty-looking low polygon sphere that resembles a rock.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_10.jpg" /></div><p>In order to look at your 3D model more closely and from all directions, you can use your mouse to navigate the 3D view. This, however, will only work if your mouse cursor is positioned within the <a id="id572" class="indexterm"></a>3D view's boundary. To zoom in and out from the view, scroll your mouse wheel accordingly; to rotate the view around the viewing point, hold the middle mouse button and move the cursor; to pan your view around, hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key and the middle mouse button at the same time and move the cursor. For more information, you can check out Blender's user manual by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manual</strong></span> on the Header menu and search for <span class="strong"><strong>Navigating</strong></span>.</p><p>Now, let's go back to the <a id="id573" class="indexterm"></a>sphere we just created. We need to change the shape of the sphere to become slightly oval so that it matches our monster's body shape. There are many ways to manipulate the mesh, but I will teach you one of the fastest ways to do itâ€”using shortcut keys. In this case, we want to scale the mesh along the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis, so let's press the <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> key and then press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> key. Now you can scale the mesh by simply moving your cursor. At this stage, however, the scaling is not applied to the mesh; you can either click on the left mouse button to apply the scaling, or cancel the operator by clicking on the right mouse button.</p><p>Do notice that the initial distance between your mouse cursor and the model when you initiate the scaling mode will affect the magnitude of scaling to your model. Try to put your mouse cursor slightly further away from the 3D model when you're about to press the <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> key, as that will give you a more natural scaling and it is easier for you to control it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_11.jpg" /></div><p>Next, what I'm going to do is to remove half of the model and ask Blender to mirror the other side of the model later. By doing this, you only need to edit half of the model and the other side will be automatically handled by Blender. This is only useful for 3D models that are symmetrical, such as humanoid characters and animals.</p><p>To remove the other <a id="id574" class="indexterm"></a>half of the mesh, what we need to do is to keep the mesh selected and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> key to enter the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> mode. Once you're in the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> mode, you<a id="id575" class="indexterm"></a> can manipulate up to every individual polygon and every vertex. Next, press <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> to deselect the vertices and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> to enter the wireframe mode. Then, adjust your view to the front of the mesh, press <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> to batch-select vertices, and select half of the model.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_12.jpg" /></div><p>After that, press <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Vertices</strong></span> from the menu that pops up. You will now get a half-spherical object that looks like the one in the following screenshot. Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> key to turn off wireframe mode <a id="id576" class="indexterm"></a>and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> again to return to object mode.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_13.jpg" /></div><p>To mirror the 3D model, exit the Edit mode and go to the modifier tab at the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> window. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Modifier</strong></span> drop-down menu and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Mirror</strong></span> under the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span> category. The mirror modifier will automatically generate identical but flipped geometries of the object the modifier is attached to, along the axis set by the user. Do notice that all the modifiers <a id="id577" class="indexterm"></a>are non-destructive effects, meaning as long as you have not clicked on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button, the effect of the modifier is not actually applied to your mesh yet, and you can easily change its settings or remove it completely without harming your model. This, however, will cost a bit more of your CPU power for Blender to display the previewing result of the modifier.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_14.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"></a>Tip</h3><p>To save your working file in Blender, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>. If it is not the first time you have saved, Blender will automatically create a backup for your previous saved file. You will find an extra file with a <code class="literal">.blend1</code> extension being generated alongside your latest saved file that has the <code class="literal">.blend</code> extension.</p></div><p>Next, we will be adding legs to the<a id="id578" class="indexterm"></a> monster. Enter Edit mode again, but this time, we want to select the faces<a id="id579" class="indexterm"></a> instead of vertices. To do that, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Face</strong></span>. Then, hold <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> and use the right mouse button to select four faces where we want the legs to <span class="emphasis"><em>grow</em></span> on.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_15.jpg" /></div><p>Next, press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> to extrude the faces. But do not move the faces away from the original position; press the right mouse button to cancel the extrusion. Why? Because we wouldn't want a leg the size of an elephant! Even though you have canceled the extrusion, the faces have actually duplicated at the original position. Now, press <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> to scale down the duplicated faces to roughly half the original size. Before we extrude the faces again, try to adjust the vertices <a id="id580" class="indexterm"></a>so that the surface looks smooth so that you get a good-looking mesh from the extrusion.</p><p>It's always a good practice<a id="id581" class="indexterm"></a> to make sure the model looks fine before moving to the next steps. This is because every small mistake accumulated along the way may result in more problems in a later stage, which may cause frustration when you are trying to fix those issues that could be avoided in the first place.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_16.jpg" /></div><p>Once you are ready, press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> again to grow the leg! Now you will notice that the other half of the body is mimicking exactly what you're doing; that's the mirror modifier doing its job. This way, you will be twice as productive and won't worry about the model not being symmetrical.</p><p>After you have extruded the leg, scale down the tip of the leg slightly and reposition the whole leg to the side. If <a id="id582" class="indexterm"></a>we take real animals as a reference, we can notice their legs are not growing out from the chest, but rather from the shoulders and hips that are located at the side of the body. Usually this takes some time to adjust but it will make your life easier later on because it will be extremely hard to change the structure of the model once it's getting more complex in a later stage.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_17.jpg" /></div><p>The leg currently looks very straight and rigid, so let's add more lines to it by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> for initiating the <a id="id583" class="indexterm"></a>loop cut operator. You will now see a pink line appearing whenever you move your cursor around the 3D model. Move your cursor to the <a id="id584" class="indexterm"></a>area between the thigh and the tip of the monster's leg, then press the left mouse button to confirm the cutting. After that, scale it slightly bigger to make the leg look bulkier.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_18.jpg" /></div><p>Repeat the same steps to create the other legs. With all four legs sticking out from the body, it's now starting to look like a living creature instead of a rock!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_19.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we will do the <a id="id585" class="indexterm"></a>bunny ears. Just like what we did previously, again, we <a id="id586" class="indexterm"></a>select a face that we want the ear to be extruded from. Extrude it once at the original position and scale it down slightly.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_20.jpg" /></div><p>Once you are happy with its size and shape, press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> again to extrude from it. This time, make it really long so that it matches the length shown in the concept art.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_21.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you extruded a<a id="id587" class="indexterm"></a> surface but never moved it away, you will be getting duplicated geometries that may cause problems later. To remove duplicated geometries, select all the faces/edges/vertices of the model, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span> key and select <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Double</strong></span> from the menu. Blender will automatically detect the doppelgangers and remove them.</p></div><p>Then, like what we <a id="id588" class="indexterm"></a>did previously to the leg, we make a loop cut in the middle of the ear by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>. Once you've done that, adjust the shape of the ear until it looks like the concept art.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_22.jpg" /></div><p>Now let's move on to the last partâ€”the tail. You might think the shape of the tail is very difficult to construct, since it has a non-uniform shape and appears to be very curvy. However, try to recall what I told you previously when I mentioned how the body shape of the monster can actually be formed by using just primitive shapes. We are actually going to do that nowâ€”let's create a primitive shape.</p><p>Have you noticed the<a id="id589" class="indexterm"></a> small cursor that seems to do nothing but keep changing position whenever you mistakenly press the left mouse button? It's called the 3D cursor, a multi-purpose movable pivot point that I find very useful from time to time. You can rotate an object around the 3D cursor, or change an object's center of origin to where it's positioned, or any other <a id="id590" class="indexterm"></a>operators that require position data. In this case, we want to create a sphere behind the monster, so let's move our mouse cursor to somewhere behind the monster and press the left mouse button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_23.jpg" /></div><p>Although now it appears to be positioned behind the monster, when you move your view around you will notice it's actually not positioned exactly there. To solve this problem, we will use the snapping operator by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Snap Cursor to Grid</strong></span>. If you can't remember all<a id="id591" class="indexterm"></a> the shortcut keys, you can press the space bar <a id="id592" class="indexterm"></a>and search for the function you're looking for. For example, I type the word <code class="literal">snap</code> and all the operators related to it will appear on the menu, including the one I was usingâ€”<span class="strong"><strong>Snap Cursor to Grid</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_24.jpg" /></div><p>Once you have created the sphere, set the value of <span class="strong"><strong>Segments</strong></span> to <code class="literal">8</code> and that of <span class="strong"><strong>Rings</strong></span> to <code class="literal">6</code> to keep the polygon low. Now, rotate it 90 degrees along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> and then <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, and then type <code class="literal">90</code> on the keyboard. It's basically a combo shortcut key that makes the process really quick.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_25.jpg" /></div><p>After that, select the faces <a id="id593" class="indexterm"></a>at the back of the sphere and extrude it <a id="id594" class="indexterm"></a>outward.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_26.jpg" /></div><p>Then, rotate the faces along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis to make it face up.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_27.jpg" /></div><p>Adjust the tip of the sphere<a id="id595" class="indexterm"></a> until it looks pointy.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_28.jpg" /></div><p>Lastly, add a loop cut to <a id="id596" class="indexterm"></a>make the curve look more even and smooth. After that, you can join both the body and tail meshes together into one, by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>J</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_29.jpg" /></div><p>There we have it! The monster's model is now completed. You might find some small problems here and there <a id="id597" class="indexterm"></a>later on but that's fine. It's completely normal to have<a id="id598" class="indexterm"></a> tons of iterations along the way.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_30.jpg" /></div></div>
