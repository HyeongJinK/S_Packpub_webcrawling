Unity allows us to pick a different set of quality settings for different platforms. You can open up the <span class="strong"><strong>QualitySettings</strong></span> window by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Quality</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_08_15.jpg" /></div><p>As you can<a id="id951" class="indexterm"></a> see, all the mobile platforms have been set to the <span class="strong"><strong>Simple</strong></span> quality level compared to the rest, which are set to <span class="strong"><strong>Fantastic</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Good</strong></span>. You can change the default quality level of each platform by clicking on the small arrow below the quality levels. You can still change the quality level inside the game provided that you have a quality settings UI for the players to do so.</p><p>Each quality level contains a set of settings that affect how Unity handles the rendering process. The settings include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Light Count</strong></span>: The maximum number of pixel lights when forward rendering is used.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Texture Quality</strong></span>: This allows you to choose the maximum resolution of the textures used in your game. The options are <span class="strong"><strong>Full Res</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Half Res</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Quarter Res</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Eighth Res</strong></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Anisotropic Textures</strong></span>: This enables if and how anisotropic textures will be used. The options are <span class="strong"><strong>Disabled</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Per Texture</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Forced On</strong></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Antialiasing</strong></span>: This sets the level of antialiasing that will be used. This antialiasing is different from the antialiasing effect script that we learned in the previous section. Instead of applying an effect to the rendered image, this <span class="strong"><strong>Antialiasing</strong></span> setting simply tells the Unity renderer to render the image several times larger than the window screen, then scale it back to the screen size again to reduce the <span class="emphasis"><em>staircase</em></span> effect. This technique is what we call <span class="strong"><strong>multi-sampling</strong></span>. The <a id="id952" class="indexterm"></a>options for the antialiasing are 2x, 4x, and 8x multi-sampling.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Soft Particles</strong></span>: This is set if soft blending should be used for particles.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Real-time Reflection Probes</strong></span>: This is set if reflection probes should be updated during gameplay.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Billboard Face Camera Position</strong></span>: This is set if the billboards face toward the camera position or face toward the camera plane.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadows</strong></span>: This determines which type of shadows should be used. The available options are <span class="strong"><strong>Hard and Soft Shadows</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hard Shadows Only</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Disable Shadows</strong></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Resolution</strong></span>: This sets the resolution of the shadow. Options are <span class="strong"><strong>Low</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Medium</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>High</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Very High</strong></span>. The higher the resolution, the greater the processing overhead will be.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Projection</strong></span>: This setting is used to determine the method used for shadow<a id="id953" class="indexterm"></a> projection. There are two different options for this. The first one is called <span class="strong"><strong>Close Fit</strong></span>, which renders the shadow at a higher resolution but may cause a wobble effect when the camera moves. The second option is called <span class="strong"><strong>Stable Fit</strong></span>, which renders lower-resolution shadows but they don't wobble with camera movements.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Distance</strong></span>: This indicates the maximum distance from the camera at which shadows will be visible. Shadows that fall beyond this distance will not be rendered.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Cascades</strong></span>: A higher number of cascades gives a better-quality shadow but at the expense of processing overhead. The options for this are zero, two, and four. You can also set how the cascades are being split.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Blend Weights</strong></span>: This indicates the number of bones that can affect a given vertex during an animation. The available options are one, two, or four bones.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>V Sync Count</strong></span>: Set the <span class="strong"><strong>V Sync Count</strong></span> setting to enable synchronization of the rendering with the display device's refresh rate to avoid <span class="emphasis"><em>tearing</em></span> artifacts.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>LOD Bias</strong></span>: The <span class="strong"><strong>LOD</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>level of details</strong></span>) levels are chosen based on the onscreen size <a id="id954" class="indexterm"></a>of an object. When the size is between two LOD levels, the choice can be biased toward the less detailed or more detailed of the two models available.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Maximum LOD Level</strong></span>: This setting is used to determine the highest LOD that will be used by the game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Particle Ray cast Budget</strong></span>: The maximum number of ray casts to use for approximate particle system collisions can be set here.</p></li></ul></div><p>Most of the time, the default settings work just fine. However, if you want more control on how your game should work, Unity provides you with all these options to do just that!</p></div>
