<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec23"></a>Creating a monster's armature</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We will start rigging<a id="id665" class="indexterm"></a> our monster character by adding an armature into the scene. You can do this by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, going to <span class="strong"><strong>Armature,</strong></span> and clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Single Bone</strong></span>. This <a id="id666" class="indexterm"></a>will create an armature set that contains only a single bone. Don't worry about it for now, as we can add more bones later on. Make sure that the armature is placed within the monster's mesh.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>You will realize that you can hardly see the bone as it's now completely blocked by the mesh. Keep the armature selected, then go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> panel under the <span class="strong"><strong>Armature</strong></span> tab, scroll down to the <span class="strong"><strong>Display</strong></span> section, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>X-Ray</strong></span> option. The bone is now rendered in front of the mesh instead of being blocked by it. This allows you to edit the bones as well as animate the character with ease.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_02.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we will start adding more bones to the armature. While the armature is being selected, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> to enter the Edit mode; you can now select, move, rotate, and scale individual bones just like you edit the 3D mesh. The first thing we need to do is to rotate the only bone<a id="id667" class="indexterm"></a> around the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis by 90 degrees. You can achieve this by selecting the individual bone and using the rotate manipulator to rotate it, or by using the shortcut key, which is much faster and flexible. Simply press <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>, press <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, and type <code class="literal">90</code>; you have now rotated the bone<a id="id668" class="indexterm"></a> in lightning speed!</p><p>The first bone is often named the<a id="id669" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>root bone</strong></span>. It is probably the only bone that has no parent, but it is linked by a chain of children bones. Thus, when you move the root bone, all the other bones will be moved along with it because the root bone sits on top of the chain hierarchy. Therefore, we will place the root bone somewhere in the middle of the mesh as when the animator moves or rotates the bone in the torso, it makes sense for the entire monster to move or rotate as well. On the other hand, it would not make any sense, for example, if the entire body rotates when the animator is just rotating the head bone.</p><p>To move the root bone, you can use the transformation manipulator or simply press the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key. Once you have positioned the root bone, select one of the small spheres at the tip of the bone and press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> to extrude a child bone from it. Select the bone you have just extruded and press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> again to extrude a child bone from it. Repeat this step several times until you get this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_03.jpg" /></div><p>At this point, we have created a chain of bones resembling the spine as well as the tail. We are about to create the bones of the limbs and ears, but we are not going to extrude them one by one as it's very time consuming and difficult to make the bones perfectly symmetrical on each side.</p><p>Just like what we did when we modeled the character mesh, we can mirror our armature with Blender as well, but not in the form of a modifier. The armature comes with an option named <span class="strong"><strong>X-Axis Mirror</strong></span>. You can<a id="id670" class="indexterm"></a> select this option in the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> tab on the Tools Shelf panel. You must enter the Edit mode while the armature is selected in order to see this option.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_04.jpg" /></div><p>Once <span class="strong"><strong>the X-Axis Mirror</strong></span> option is ticked, you can now extrude two bones simultaneously by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span>. The other bone is the mirrored version and is thus is automatically positioned on the other side of the bone you just extruded. You can still extrude a single bone by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> without holding the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key. Play around with it until you get something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_05.jpg" /></div><p>Next, we are going<a id="id671" class="indexterm"></a> to bind the armature to the mesh using a process named <a id="id672" class="indexterm"></a><span class="strong"><strong>skinning</strong></span>. To do this, quit the Edit mode and select the mesh. Then, hold <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> and select the armature. The selection order is very importantâ€”the armature must be the<a id="id673" class="indexterm"></a> last selected object in order for this to work. Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span>, and a menu with the title <span class="strong"><strong>Set Parent to</strong></span> will pop out. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Armature Deform with Automatic Weights</strong></span> and we're done.</p><p>What we actually did was ask Blender to automatically assign weights to the skin when binding the armature to the mesh. This usually only works well with a simple mesh, like the one we're working on now, and may cause problems with a more complicated mesh. The other options require a different setup, so we will ignore those for now.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_06.jpg" /></div><p>In order to test the<a id="id674" class="indexterm"></a> rig, select the armature and enter Pose mode by <a id="id675" class="indexterm"></a>choosing the <span class="strong"><strong>Pose Mode</strong></span> option from the combo box, as shown in the following screenshot</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_07.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>Keep in mind that the<a id="id676" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Pose Mode</strong></span> option is only available when an armature is selected, and it will not appear otherwise.</p></div><p>Once you're in Pose mode, you can freely move or rotate the bones around without actually affecting the original posture of the armature. If you try to go back to Edit mode, you will see all the bones returned to their original position and rotation. This allows you to edit your bones at any time in the middle of animating your character. Blender is such a flexible tool!</p><p>Move the bones around and make some poses to see whether any problems occur with the mesh deformation. For a simple mesh like this one, there are usually no major problems, and only a few very minor <a id="id677" class="indexterm"></a>ones. You can come back to fix the minor problems<a id="id678" class="indexterm"></a> once we have learned how to do skin weight painting. More details on this will be covered later in the chapter.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_03_08.jpg" /></div></div>
