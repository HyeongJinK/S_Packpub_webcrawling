What I'm trying to do now is to bake the soft shadow that we usually call<a id="id612" class="indexterm"></a> the ambient occlusion onto the blank texture. This AO map not only serves as a guideline for texture painting but also makes the final texture look more realistic. This step is not necessary depending on what style you're trying to do.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_41.jpg" /></div><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> window, switch over to the <span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span> tab and check <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong></span>. Then, scroll down a little bit and you will see the <span class="strong"><strong>Gather</strong></span> category. Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Samples</strong></span> value from <span class="strong"><strong>5</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_42.jpg" /></div><p>Next, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span><a id="id613" class="indexterm"></a> tab and open up the <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> category. Change <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong></span> and check <span class="strong"><strong>Normalized</strong></span>. The normalized setting will <a id="id614" class="indexterm"></a>make the AO map look brighter and clean.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_43.jpg" /></div><p>Once you're done with the settings, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> button and watch the magic happen!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_44.jpg" /></div><p>Although the ambient occlusion now looks pretty good, there are some noticeable artifacts. This happens because the mesh is too low-polygon for Blender to bake the AO correctly. To solve this<a id="id615" class="indexterm"></a> issue, we need to temporarily increase the polycount for baking the AO map, and then<a id="id616" class="indexterm"></a> reduce it back to the original polycount. Sounds scary? You can actually achieve that using Blender's Subdivision Surface modifier.</p><p>While the mesh is selected, switch over to the <span class="strong"><strong>Modifier</strong></span> tab and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Modifier</strong></span>. From the drop-down menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Subdivision Surface</strong></span> to apply the modifier to the monster. Set the <span class="strong"><strong>Subdivision</strong></span> settings to <code class="literal">4</code> and uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>Subdivide UVs</strong></span>. We want to increase the polygon and not affect our UV map. Blender's modifiers are non-destructive to your mesh, which means it will keep a copy of your original mesh in the memory and can be recovered anytime by removing the modifiers from the mesh, as long as you don't click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button on the modifier.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_45.jpg" /></div><p>After you have applied the subdivision modifier to the monster, try to bake the AO map again. This time, you will<a id="id617" class="indexterm"></a> get a much better ambient occlusion that looks nice and clean. The subdivision <a id="id618" class="indexterm"></a>modifier can then be removed from the mesh by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> button on its top-right corner. To export the AO map, simply go to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save as Image</strong></span> on the bottom of your UV/Image Editor.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_46.jpg" /></div><p>Open up your image editing software that support multilayer editing, such as Photoshop, GIMP, Sumo Paint, Krita, and so on. Then, place the UV map and AO map into a different layer so that you can easily turn it on and off when you're creating the texture. Set the ambient occlusion layer's blending mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiply</strong></span> so that it will blend with the texture layers below it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_47.jpg" /></div><p>And<a id="id619" class="indexterm"></a> finally, the texture<a id="id620" class="indexterm"></a> is ready!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_48.jpg" /></div><p>To apply the texture onto the mesh, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Open Image</strong></span> from the UV editor menu. Pick the<a id="id621" class="indexterm"></a> texture you have just created and there you have it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_49.jpg" /></div><p>Notice how the flat UV on the face area makes the texturing process easier. The eyes and mouth appear to match exactly the texture because there aren't any stretches on the UV. This is why you should <a id="id622" class="indexterm"></a>always put more effort into UV unwrapping to avoid problems during the texturing stage. We have completed the monster model. Hip hip hooray!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_02_50.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip14"></a>Tip</h3><p>Blender's material system is not used when creating 3D assets for game engines other than the <a id="id623" class="indexterm"></a><span class="strong"><strong>BGE</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Blender Game Engine</strong></span>). Other game engines are using their own distinctive material system, hence it's not possible to export Blender's materials to these <a id="id624" class="indexterm"></a>game engines. Instead of using the materials in Blender, textures are opened <a id="id625" class="indexterm"></a>directly in the UV/Image Editor for preview purposes.</p></div></div>
