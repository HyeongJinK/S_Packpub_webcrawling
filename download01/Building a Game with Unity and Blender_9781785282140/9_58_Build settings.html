<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch09lvl1sec56"></a>Build settings</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Deploying a game in <a id="id955" class="indexterm"></a>Unity is quite straightforward; if you have already set the build settings and built the game before, just go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build &amp; Run</strong></span> to straightaway build it again without changing the settings. If you have not built the game before and have clicked on <span class="strong"><strong>Build &amp; Run</strong></span>, Unity will automatically open up the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window for you, which you can also access by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>. </p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window looks like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_01.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see from the window, the settings are minimal and could be different depending on<a id="id956" class="indexterm"></a> which target platform you're selecting. You can try to choose a different platform, then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button to make the switch. It may take some time for Unity to automatically convert all the game assets into formats that are compatible with the selected platform, and no action is required on your side. However, some target platforms are not available in the free version of Unity; check out Unity's official website to find out more about this.</p><p>On the lower-right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window, you will see several different options, such as target platform, architecture, development build, and so on. Again, it varies depending on the platform you've chosen. Next I have listed the settings for some of the more popular platforms, such as Web Player, PC, iOS, Android, and WebGL, and I will explain to you what each of these settings mean.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec20"></a>Shared settings</h3></div></div></div><p>Shared settings is where you <a id="id957" class="indexterm"></a>define various parameters that are shared across different target platforms.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Development Build</strong></span>: If this <a id="id958" class="indexterm"></a>option is checked, Unity will display debugging information in your game, such as outlines and logs, for easy debugging. Unity will also include debugging symbols and enable<a id="id959" class="indexterm"></a> the ability to connect to the profiler.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Autoconnect Profiler</strong></span>: This only becomes active if you checked <span class="strong"><strong>Development Build</strong></span>. It will <a id="id960" class="indexterm"></a>allow Unity to automatically pick up an active profiler during debugging.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Script Debugging</strong></span>: This option <a id="id961" class="indexterm"></a>will allow Unity to inspect your code at runtime. It can help you determine when a function is called and <a id="id962" class="indexterm"></a>with which values. Unity uses MonoDevelop to debug the scripts in your game, so make sure that MonoDevelop is installed on your computer.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec21"></a>The webplayer</h3></div></div></div><p>The webplayer is in an odd state <a id="id963" class="indexterm"></a>at the time of writing this book. Due to the discontinued support of NPAPI in the latest versions of Chrome, Unity web player no longer work on the Chrome browser. Moreover, other web browsers will likely follow suit, which means if there is no alternative to<a id="id964" class="indexterm"></a> NPAPI, Unity web player will most likely become obsolete in the near future.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Streamed</strong></span>: Instead of <a id="id965" class="indexterm"></a>waiting for all the contents of the game level to be downloaded before allowing the player to start playing your game, this option allows the game to start running while downloading the contents at the same time. However, this requires a lot of tuning and structuring to your game so that it can seamlessly run and load without the player noticing it.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Offline Deployment</strong></span>: By <a id="id966" class="indexterm"></a>checking this option, Unity will place the UnityObject.js file, which is used to interface the player with the host page, alongside the web player during the build. This enables the player to work with the local script file even when there is no network connection.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec22"></a>PC, Mac, and Linux standalone</h3></div></div></div><p>Here, you <a id="id967" class="indexterm"></a>can set the build <a id="id968" class="indexterm"></a>settings for <a id="id969" class="indexterm"></a>all the three major desktop operating<a id="id970" class="indexterm"></a> systems: Windows, Mac <a id="id971" class="indexterm"></a>OS X, and Linux. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Target Platform</strong></span>: You can <a id="id972" class="indexterm"></a>choose between Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux as the target platform for deployment.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Architecture</strong></span>: For <a id="id973" class="indexterm"></a>Windows, you can choose between x86 (32 bit) or x86_64 (64 bit). For<a id="id974" class="indexterm"></a> Mac OS X <a id="id975" class="indexterm"></a>and Linux, you can choose <a id="id976" class="indexterm"></a>between x86, x86_64, or Universal build (32 bit + 64 bit).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec23"></a>iOS</h3></div></div></div><p>This section provides an extra option specifically for the iOS platform.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Symlink Unity Libraries</strong></span>: <span class="strong"><strong>Symlink Unity Libraries</strong></span> creates a link to the original core<a id="id977" class="indexterm"></a> libraries that have already been built on the Unity side of the<a id="id978" class="indexterm"></a> project when generating an iOS Xcode project for faster iteration time and smaller build folders.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec24"></a>Android</h3></div></div></div><p>This is where you change the build settings for the Android platform.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Texture Compression</strong></span>: By <a id="id979" class="indexterm"></a>default, Unity uses the ETC1/RGBA16 format for all the textures used in the game. If you wish to build your game for a specific hardware architecture, you can override this default behavior by choosing a different<a id="id980" class="indexterm"></a> format from the drop-down box. This option is designed for advanced users.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Google Android Project</strong></span>: By <a id="id981" class="indexterm"></a>checking this option, Unity generates a project that can be opened by Android Studio, instead of directly generating an APK file and exporting it to the device.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec25"></a>WebGL</h3></div></div></div><p>WebGL is a relatively new <a id="id982" class="indexterm"></a>platform compared to the others. It is still not<a id="id983" class="indexterm"></a> very stable at the time of writing this book; however, it may become the "de facto" web platform in Unity if the web player is to be deprecated in the near future.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec01"></a>Optimization level</h4></div></div></div><p>This option allows you to <a id="id984" class="indexterm"></a>select an optimization flag for the compiler that builds your game. When set to <span class="strong"><strong>Slow</strong></span>, Unity produces an unoptimized build that is bigger in size and causes slower performance but is much faster to build. This allows you to quickly test your game and iterate on code issues. The <span class="strong"><strong>Fast</strong></span> option produces optimized builds, and <span class="strong"><strong>Fastest</strong></span> enables some additional optimizations, but makes your builds take longer to complete. Use the <span class="strong"><strong>Fastest</strong></span> option only for your final releases.</p><p>After you are done<a id="id985" class="indexterm"></a> setting up the build settings (normally, the default settings work just fine), please make sure that you have added all your scenes to the build list, otherwise you will not be able to load that scene from the script. To add your current scene to the build list, go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button. Once everything is good, click either the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Build and Run</strong></span> button. A window will pop out and ask you to key in the name of your game's executable. After that, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_02.jpg" /></div><p>Then, Unity will start the process of building your game. It may take some time, depending on how many scenes you have and how many assets are linked to these scenes. The build process is quite different based on the target platform you've selected, and produces a different result too.</p><p>For web player, Unity will generate a <code class="literal">.unity3d</code> file that gets embedded into an HTML file. For PC, Unity will generate an executable and a data folder that keeps all the game assets in it. Mobile platforms such as iOS and Android are quite different; in this case, Unity will instead generate a project folder and launch its respective compiler (Xcode for iOS, Android SDK for Android) to build the game and deploy it directly to the mobile device. WebGL, on the other hand, is quite similar to the web player as it generates an HTML file too. However, instead of a <code class="literal">.unity3d</code> file, Unity will produce a bunch of JavaScript files that empower your game.</p><p>The entire build process is automated so you can sit down, drink a cup of coffee, and relax while waiting for it to finish the job!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_03.jpg" /></div><p>After your game has been built by Unity, you can then try to run your game! Since I'm building the game for PC, a graphics configuration window will pop out by default when the game is launched, which you can disable at the player settings; there will be more on that later. There are <a id="id986" class="indexterm"></a>several options on the window, such as screen resolution, graphics quality, windowed mode, and monitor selection. You can also change the input mapping if you want to. </p><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play!</strong></span> to start playing your game!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282140/graphics/B04610_09_04.jpg" /></div></div></div></div>
