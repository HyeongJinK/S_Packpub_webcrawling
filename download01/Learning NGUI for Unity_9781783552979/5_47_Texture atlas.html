These sub-images are the actual textures for your 2D or 3D objects and can be rendered by editing the<a id="id578" class="indexterm"></a> object's texture coordinates, telling which part of the texture atlas should be used.</p><p>The goal here is performance; storing 20 frequently used textures in a large one will require only one large texture to be treated by the<a id="id579" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics Processing Unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPU</strong></span>), which is faster than treating these 20 textures separately. This method ensures that even for 20 different textures, rendering them will only require one single draw call.</p><p>These textures can have variable sizes, but keep in mind that using textures with the power of two sizes is easier for the GPU to process: 16 x 16, 32 x 32, 64 x 64, and so on. That's because the textures have to be arranged in a specific order before being sent to the GPU.</p><p>Unity's largest texture size is 4096 x 4096, thus the maximum size for an atlas with NGUI is 4096 x 4096 pixels. It's large enough for recurrent user interface elements such as buttons, icons, and so on.</p><p>Fonts can also be stored in<a id="id580" class="indexterm"></a> an atlas; all characters are then stored in a bitmap texture, rendering them in the same draw call with all other sprites of the same atlas.</p><p>When you need large textures to be displayed, for example, an image background for your UI, it is recommended that you don't add it to your atlas and use the <code class="literal">UITexture</code> component instead, which we'll also discuss during this chapter.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec91"></a>The atlas prefab</h3></div></div></div><p>With NGUI, an atlas prefab is<a id="id581" class="indexterm"></a> used to contain sprites and fonts. It is composed of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A large texture file containing all sprites and fonts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Material</code> with this texture file is assigned, with a specific shader</p></li></ul></div><p>The atlas prefab has the <code class="literal">UIAtlas</code> component attached to it. Its purpose is to contain information about your sprites' positions and sizes within the large texture.</p><p>Thanks to this prefab, the<a id="id582" class="indexterm"></a> same material and atlas (large texture) are used to hold all our sprites instead of using multiple materials and separate small textures.</p></div></div>
