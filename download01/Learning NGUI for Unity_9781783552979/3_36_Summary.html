We will use these throughout the entire book, and we will discover more about them gradually.</p><p>We can now confidently move on to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a> <span class="emphasis"><em>C# with NGUI</em></span>, where we'll learn how to handle events and interact with widgets directly through code.</p></div>
