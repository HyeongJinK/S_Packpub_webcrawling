There are three typical sizes: small (30), medium (50), and large (100).</p><p>A reference atlas has been used to point to one of the following atlases: <code class="literal">SDAtlas</code>, <code class="literal">HDAtlas</code>, or <code class="literal">SHDAtlas</code>. Depending on the screen's width, our new <code class="literal">AtlasSwitchController</code> script loads and sets the adapted atlas for the current device it's running on.</p><p>In order to ensure that our sprites remain crisp after the atlas switching, we make sure all widgets are pixel perfect using the <code class="literal">MakePixelPerfect()</code> method.</p><p>Finally, you learned how to configure a reference font that lets you change multiple labels' assigned fonts by simply making the reference point to another font file.</p><p>You now understand and master the most important features of NGUI.
