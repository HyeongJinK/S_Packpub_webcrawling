We created our tooltip reference object and used the <code class="literal">OnTooltip()</code> event method to show localized tooltips.</p><p>We learned that public <code class="literal">EventDelegate</code> variables can be used to assign callback methods to events with a simple drag-and-drop through the Inspector view. It is important to note that these callback methods require both <code class="literal">public</code> and <code class="literal">non-static</code> methods to be accessible through the Inspector view.</p><p>The <code class="literal">UIKey Binding</code> and <code class="literal">UIKey Navigation</code> components were used and configured to enable full keyboard and controller compatibility for our menu and options page.</p><p>Finally, we made sure <code class="literal">UI Root</code> persists through scene changing using the <code class="literal">Singleton</code> class from which our <code class="literal">MenuManager</code> derives.</p><p>It's time to see how we can customize our UI with our own assets and fonts. Let's move on to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Atlas and Font Customization</em></span>.</p></div>
