We made sure our power sources were draggable in the 3D space using the <code class="literal">UIDragObject</code> component by the use of its <code class="literal">Movement</code> vector parameter to limit the movement to a horizontal plane.</p><p>We used NGUI's <code class="literal">OnPress()</code> event on 3D world elements to add character movement when the player clicks on the ground or any other interactive element.</p><p>We have created the elemental switch UI for the player to switch the power source's current element using the four <code class="literal">Fire</code>, <code class="literal">Ice</code>, <code class="literal">Lightning</code>, and <code class="literal">Water</code> buttons. The current element's button is grayed out using the <code class="literal">isEnabled</code> Boolean.</p><p>Using the new <code class="literal">FollowObject</code> component we created, we can now force a 2D UI widget to follow any object within the 3D scene with a configurable <code class="literal">Offset</code> vector. It was used to make sure the elemental switch UI remains displayed over the concerned power source.</p><p>A progress bar has been added to the power sources in order to give the player feedback on the elemental switch duration.</p><p>Finally, we made sure we could launch our game from the main menu by adding a fade-out effect of the main menu's background texture.</p><p>Now that we've seen how to integrate in-game 2D user interfaces within the 3D environment, let's see how we can add 3D user interface elements in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>3D User Interface</em></span>.</p></div>
