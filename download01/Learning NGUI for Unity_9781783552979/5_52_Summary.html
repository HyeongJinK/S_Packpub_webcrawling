The same tool was used to add custom sprites to our new atlas.</p><p>We've used the <code class="literal">Border</code> parameter to configure both <code class="literal">Sliced</code> and <code class="literal">Tiled</code> sprites and then changed our buttons' and windows' appearances.</p><p>You learned how to easily integrate dynamic fonts, and then the <code class="literal">Font Maker</code> tool helped us to create a bitmap font. We can remember that bitmap fonts don't add draw calls if its atlas is already used on the scene.</p><p>Finally, we've used the <code class="literal">UITexture</code> component to display a large texture as background; it's an easy way to display textures that aren't stored within any atlas.</p><p>We can now move on to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The In-Game User Interface</em></span>, in which you'll learn how to create in-game user interface elements with NGUI.</p></div>
