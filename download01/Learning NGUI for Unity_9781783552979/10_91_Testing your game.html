Here's some advice to do it right:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Don't test too early; if you have little to show or the concept is more defined in your head than in the build's content, wait a little more.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Don't test too late, otherwise<a id="id1083" class="indexterm"></a> it will require a tremendous amount of time and will cost your company a fortune to make these changes.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Take representative players of your audience; do not organize tests with hardcore players or beginners only. Take people who like your type of game, and also invite some who don't. Finally, don't limit your tests to people you know or work with as their judgment is biased—go for strangers!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do not interrupt nor influence the player; let him make the mistakes you guess he's going to make in a few seconds. This is precisely what you invited him for—to discover what he doesn't understand and see what is missing in the game for him to know what to do.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now that we have talked about the basics of testing, let's go into the details about when to test what.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec167"></a>When and what</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>When</strong></span> should we test, and <span class="strong"><strong>what</strong></span> should we test as the project moves forward?</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec108"></a>Concept prototypes</h4></div></div></div><p>Test the concept with early prototypes; they will have bugs and terrible placeholders instead of your magical world of <a id="id1084" class="indexterm"></a>unicorns and rainbows, but what we call the core gameplay will be there—and that's the first thing you want to assess.</p><p>Is it fun at the beginning and boring after an hour? If so, why is that, and what can you add or remove to make sure the fun does not fade out? That's the most important part: your game's fun evaluation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec109"></a>Test the rest early</h4></div></div></div><p>After having tested, reworked, and validated your game's core gameplay, you don't need to wait for the game to be<a id="id1085" class="indexterm"></a> in the alpha or beta stage to test other aspects such as the user interface.</p><p>Testing these elements early will reduce design mistake correction costs and save you the trouble of facing that same problem later, when it might no longer be the priority.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec110"></a>Vertical slices</h4></div></div></div><p>Now, the question is "How can we test early, but with a representative game?"</p><p>The answer is to<a id="id1086" class="indexterm"></a> test on what we call <span class="strong"><strong>vertical slices</strong></span>; develop a small and interesting part of your game, but <a id="id1087" class="indexterm"></a>do so fully. During this short episode, you'll have a representative vision of every aspect of the game in its close-to-final quality.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec111"></a>Readability</h4></div></div></div><p>You must test the <span class="strong"><strong>readability</strong></span> of your<a id="id1088" class="indexterm"></a> interface. Here's an example of the questions this test involves:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Are the <a id="id1089" class="indexterm"></a>meanings of some icons completely obscure to your players?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do they comment on forgetting what the symbols mean?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Can they easily read the text you are displaying?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do they understand the text as it's supposed to be, or is it ambiguous?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do your players often miss displayed information?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Is the user interface too cluttered?</p></li></ul></div><p>If your answer to some of the preceding questions is positive, maybe you're displaying too much at the same time. It can also be due to the fact that you're displaying information too far from where the interaction began, and the player is expecting the feedback somewhere else.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec112"></a>Guidance</h4></div></div></div><p>You also need to test the general <a id="id1090" class="indexterm"></a>guidance we talked about in heuristics. Here are a few questions you could ask yourself while testing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Does your player know instantly when he has something to do?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Does your player sometimes feel lost and does this bother him?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Does he wonder what his goal is or what he needs to do next?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Are your players making the same mistake over and over again?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do you sometimes <a id="id1091" class="indexterm"></a>sense frustration as he says "how do I do that?", "where is that action?", or "how do I access that?"</p></li></ul></div><p>Naturally, even on late builds and the final product, you'll still find things to improve.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec113"></a>Test occurrences</h4></div></div></div><p>You might be wondering how often you should test. <span class="emphasis"><em>As much as possible</em></span> is the answer. It is better to do smaller but<a id="id1092" class="indexterm"></a> regular tests with fewer users, rather than one or two large-scale tests at greater expense.</p><p>It is also a good idea to change your users in between test sessions and test on a wider range of people. By doing so, you will identify more issues in all potential players.</p><p>Once you have a fully playable version, you can focus on the user experience. Ok, so how can we test a game's usability?</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec168"></a>The usability testing method</h3></div></div></div><p>The key to efficient <a id="id1093" class="indexterm"></a>usability testing is to let your subject play while you observe him. Observation on its own is pretty efficient and is usually enough to decipher most the usability issues.</p><p>In some cases, you'll need more<a id="id1094" class="indexterm"></a> measures, such as the number of successful or missed clicks, durations of tasks, paths chosen, failure counts, and more. In other words, you need to be prepared.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec114"></a>Preparation</h4></div></div></div><p>This is the central part of usability testing; you must be ready to see, hear, and question your player to understand what goes <a id="id1095" class="indexterm"></a>wrong, but you should also try to understand why it goes wrong for them when it was right for you.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl4sec25"></a>Goal</h5></div></div></div><p>First things first; you need to<a id="id1096" class="indexterm"></a> define your test session's goal. Once it's defined, you can go through the game yourself or with your team, keeping this goal in mind.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl4sec26"></a>Using personas</h5></div></div></div><p>During the walkthrough of the vertical slice, try to put yourself in your player's shoes. Remember the personas you<a id="id1097" class="indexterm"></a> wrote about who this player is. This way, you'll identify areas that can potentially present usability issues.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl4sec27"></a>New features</h5></div></div></div><p>You could write down a list of new features that have been added since your last test session. This way, it's easier to<a id="id1098" class="indexterm"></a> invent a scenario in which the player uses every new feature or menu and goes through new areas of doubt you may have.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl4sec28"></a>Guide, don't help</h5></div></div></div><p>Once you have identified and listed the areas of testing and objectives for the player, make sure they <a id="id1099" class="indexterm"></a>are correctly set up in the game. If the objectives are not yet implemented in the actual game, write down instructions for your players to make sure they follow your desired scenario.</p><p>You or the person in charge of the test will tell the players what to do and when; for example, go to the castle, slay the dragon, and save the princess.</p><p>Be careful when you deliver your instructions; you should avoid influencing the player. If he asks you, "But how do I do that?", you should say "slay the dragon". Avoid saying something such as "all right, go through the back door, strangle the goblin, then open your bag, use your grappling to climb the tower of roses and switch weapons, then throw an explosive, hide, take your assault rifle, and shoot him in the eye."</p><p>In cases where objectives are implemented in the game, your level of guidance as a playtest coordinator shouldn't need to exceed something such as "We'd like you to test our game for an hour. Feel free to speak out aloud any comment that comes to your mind. Follow the objectives of the game; we will look at how you play, but we won't judge you. We will talk about your experience when you are done playing."</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl4sec29"></a>Observation grid</h5></div></div></div><p>Before you invite your players, having an<a id="id1100" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>observation grid</strong></span> is<a id="id1101" class="indexterm"></a> a good idea. Write down every question you want an answer for on that grid. In the column next to it, write the event or scene in which you will be able to observe it.</p><p>Now that the preparation phase is done, you are ready to invite players and start testing.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec115"></a>Invite players!</h4></div></div></div><p>Now, you need to invite players. How many you invite is up to you but, for usability tests, five players is a minimum. If you want quantitative data for statistics, you'll need more players.</p><p>If you need to evaluate the user experience more<a id="id1102" class="indexterm"></a> than the usability, you will instead need about fifteen players.</p><p>Select varied players. Remember the personas you wrote to invite players matching your target audience. Invite both male and female, right-handed and left-handed, and test with different cultures and countries if possible. The more variety, the better.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec116"></a>Environment</h4></div></div></div><p>It is preferable to perform your test and observations in a dedicated room. Avoid open spaces where people walk, chat, drink coffee, and make noise. Your player should be focused on what he is doing; help him achieve that.</p><p>If you are testing for a mobile <a id="id1103" class="indexterm"></a>game, it can be interesting to test in a representative environment; ask your player to play both standing and seated, or on a stable or moving platform if your target audience is someone on a bus or the underground.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec117"></a>Take notes</h4></div></div></div><p>During the observation, write down and rate how well your player performs. Notice where he fails, where he seems frustrated, and how he recovers from failures or missed attempts, but also note down the good points: what he does easily and gets him excited.</p><p>Once your observation is complete,<a id="id1104" class="indexterm"></a> you can use these notes to ask him questions or clarify errors you might misinterpret otherwise. During the debriefing phase, compare what your player remembers of the game with what you have noticed.</p><p>You could ask him to tell you about what he liked and disliked the most; ask him to explain the difficulties he went through as they might differ from what you've seen.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec118"></a>Prioritize</h4></div></div></div><p>Once you have been through these steps with all your players, prioritize your changes according to the<a id="id1105" class="indexterm"></a> number of players who faced the same difficulty by taking into account how critical the difficulty was, how much it impacted their experience, and how much it discouraged them.</p><p>Keep track of the changes you make in the game to test them in the next usability test session. You will then be able to see how it improved and check whether it raises another issue you haven't anticipated.</p><p>We now know how to<a id="id1106" class="indexterm"></a> prepare and run a usability test session efficiently. Let's summarize what we have learned in this final chapter.</p></div></div></div>
