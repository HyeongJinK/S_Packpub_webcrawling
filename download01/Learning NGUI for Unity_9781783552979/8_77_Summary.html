After testing it, we stated different issues prompted by the mobile platform switching.</p><p>After correcting the autorotation, back button, character movement, and right-click issues, we implemented touch-and-hold features with visual feedback for the player.</p><p>This touch-and-hold feature is used for two different actions; displaying the elemental switch UI and making in-game widgets draggable, allowing the player to customize their user interface as they want.</p><p>Once all issues were corrected, you learned how to configure and use Unity Remote to avoid rebuilding the game after each modification. We also had a peek at the profiler's functionalities and enabled it to record data directly from our device. You use this to optimize the game and fix performance issues. Finally, we discovered how to retrieve debug logs and errors from the device using <code class="literal">locat</code> from Android Debug Bridge.</p><p>Now that we have switched to a mobile platform, we can talk about screen sizes and aspect ratios in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Screen Sizes and Aspect Ratios</em></span>.</p></div>
