They can move around the 3D environment to gather four different elements—fire, water, lightning, or ice, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783552979/graphics/2979OT_06_01.jpg" /></div><p>The player's objective is<a id="id665" class="indexterm"></a> to gather elements from the<a id="id666" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Power Source</strong></span> and deliver them to the correct <a id="id667" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Power Feed</strong></span> that gradually appears on the scene. For example, he or she must gather water from a well and bring it to a small tree to make it grow, or must carry fire to a frozen waterfall to melt it and make it flow again.</p><p>Each <span class="strong"><strong>Power Source</strong></span> can be <a id="id668" class="indexterm"></a>moved by dragging-and-dropping, and a right-click makes the <a id="id669" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Elemental Switch UI</strong></span> appear. With that UI, the player can request the <span class="strong"><strong>Power Source</strong></span> to change its current element to one of the other three available elements.</p><p>For example, in the preceding screenshot, if the player needs to gather lightning, he or she can switch the left-hand side power source from fire to lightning by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Lightning</strong></span> button. This elemental switch takes a few seconds to take effect, which is indicated by a progress bar.</p><p>For a <span class="strong"><strong>Power Feed</strong></span>, the player has a limited time—that's where the movable <span class="strong"><strong>Power Source</strong></span> is useful—it must be close to the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> and their <span class="strong"><strong>Power Feed</strong></span> to save time!</p><p>OK, now let's get the necessary assets to start working on this game's UI.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec102"></a>Necessary assets</h3></div></div></div><p>Some game elements aren't linked to NGUI, and we don't need to learn here how they were created.
