Our role is to make the user's life easier.</p><p>In games, the main<a id="id1029" class="indexterm"></a> difference is that the product is hardly fun unless a certain level of challenge is involved. Thus, it is important to define from the beginning where we want to implement this challenge and remove the rest of the difficulties.</p><p>This ensures the <a id="id1030" class="indexterm"></a>player focuses his attention on developing his competencies and overcomes the intended challengeâ€”and not another non-relevant difficulty, such as trying to switch weapons.</p><p>Some objectives should be hard to accomplish, but the interface and interaction system must drive you to accomplish them. Difficulties that interfere with the entertainment goal should be solved to maximize the player's experience.</p><p>In the next section, we will review usability methods to tackle issues that are not part of the game.</p></div>
