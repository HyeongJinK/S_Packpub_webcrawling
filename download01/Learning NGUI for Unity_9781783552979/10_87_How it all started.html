The role of the game designer and the user experience designer is to decide which data must be given to the player and which should remain hidden.</p><p>Video games require constant attention and interaction; therefore, when designing a game and its GUI, it is important to consider usability issues to ensure that the player's cognitive resources are not misdirected.</p></div>
