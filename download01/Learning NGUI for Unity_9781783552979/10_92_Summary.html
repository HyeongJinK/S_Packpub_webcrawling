First, we can sum up the concepts we defined as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>User experience</strong></span>: This includes all the aspects of the experience that will affect user perception.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Personas</strong></span>: This includes a fictional but complete and consistent target player profile.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Usability</strong></span>: This describes the ease of use of an interface.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Flow</strong></span>: This is the state in which the player is focused on his current task and forgets about the rest. It requires a challenge that meets his skills.</p></li></ul></div><p>We also discussed what criteria can help us assess the ease of use of our game's user interface. These criteria can be summed up as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Guidance</strong></span>: This ensures the player never feels lost.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Workload</strong></span>: This helps in reducing the cognitive, perceptive, and memory charge.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Explicit control</strong></span>: This makes the user aware of available actions.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Adaptability</strong></span>: This is the ability of a system to adjust to the player's characteristics and preferences.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Error management</strong></span>: This protects and informs the player about errors and offers him the possibility to correct them quickly and easily.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Consistency</strong></span>: This keeps your UI elements' position and format consistent from one page to another. The same goes for functions in similar contexts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, we have seen how to prepare and run usability tests from the session's goal to priority management. We have also learned how to invite the right players and observe them without disturbance.</p><p>You now have enough knowledge to enhance your user interface's usability, using heuristics and detecting issues with a specific usability test method.</p><p>That's where our journey together comes to an end. I hope you enjoyed this book, and that it will help you build effective and usable graphical user interfaces using NGUI for Unity!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"></a>Note</h3><p>
