There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of an estranged relative, or enemies who become friends and vice versa. We will create our story and game based on such a story.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>Plot</h3></div></div></div><p>Once upon a time there was a great kingdom. Ruled by the great King Zazar. The ruler of the kingdom was a generous lord to his subjects. The kingdom under the rule of Zazar was peaceful and prosperous, however, over time internal family rivalries and struggles caused cracks in the strong bond that kept the kingdom intact.</p><p>Due to mysterious events, the great king decided to move his family away from the kingdom and trust his son with one of his trusted, wise elders. The kingdom was never the same. Until now!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Exploration and quests</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we have defined our plot for the game.
