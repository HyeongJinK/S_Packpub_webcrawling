The core of the chapter was to create a usable Inventory System. We began the chapter by discussing the Weighted Inventory and gave a brief overview of its concept. Then we determined the item types we are going to be using for our game.</p><p>We created the scripts <code class="literal">BaseItem.cs</code>, <code class="literal">InventoryItem.cs</code>, and <code class="literal">InventorySystem.cs</code>. These scripts were then utilized as a starting point to design and develop our inventory. We then updated the <code class="literal">GameMaster.cs</code> script to test the basics of the newly created scripts and be able to view the data within the Unity IDE by serializing the attributes. We did this by instantiating an <code class="literal">InventoryItem</code> and inserting it into the <code class="literal">InventorySystem</code> and validated the operation visually through the IDE.</p><p>The next step was to actually create the inventory item prefabs. This section covered how to navigate and find your customizable inventory items if your model included everything on the actual fbx model, how to extract it from the model and convert into a Prefab for later use. Then we created a new script called <code class="literal">InventoryItemAgent.cs</code> which was attached to every prefab created to represent an inventory item. This script basically gives us the ability to set the data for each Inventory Item from within the IDE. Very useful! We also had to attach a collider to each prefab to handle collision and trigger a pick-up call when the player collided with the object.</p><p>Once we had the basics in place, we started looking at how to design and implement the user interface for our inventory system. We discussed the categories that we want to represent and how the items within each category will be listed / displayed for the player during game play. We implemented the initial framework for the Inventory Window and integrated it with the game.</p><p>Now we were ready to discuss how to create a dynamic item viewer that can be populated during runtime and represent the inventory items we have collected correctly. We introduced some new user interface concepts such as scroll view and how to utilize layouts in our interface. We did a quick test with a simple placeholder to just display the name of the item. Once we got the mechanics working, we implemented the main inventory item control panel and converted it into a prefab to be used instantiated at runtime when needed.</p><p>At the end, we worked on the integration of the Inventory System with the Inventory UI with the GameMaster and Player Character to have the final implementation. This required that we update and modify more scripts.</p><p>By the end of the chapter, you have a fully functional Inventory System that can be expanded as needed. In the next two chapters, we are going to see how to enhance our user interface by adding an HUD and finally cover the concepts of multiplayer programming.</p></div>
