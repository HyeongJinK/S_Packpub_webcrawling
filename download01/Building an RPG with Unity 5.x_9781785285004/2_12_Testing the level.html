We can use the built-in 3<sup>rd</sup> person character controller that comes in the Standard Assets, and do a quick walk-through of the level.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>If you have not imported the Standard Assets when you created the project. You will need to import them by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span>, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package | Characters.</strong></span>
</p></div><p>In your <span class="emphasis"><em>Project Window</em></span>, you will see a folder called <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span>, there is a subfolder called <span class="strong"><strong>Character Controllers</strong></span>. You will need to select the <span class="strong"><strong>3rd Person Controller Prefab</strong></span> and drop it somewhere on the current scene. A good location will be next to the shack. Make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Person Controller</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>3rdPC</strong></span>) is above the terrain so it does not fall through!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"></a>Note</h3><p>In the <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController.js</code> component, you might have to assign the Idle, Walk, Run and Jump animations.</p></div><p>You will have to attach a Rigidbody component to the 3rdPC GameObject. This is needed to make sure that our <span class="strong"><strong>player-character</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PC</strong></span>) will use the built-in physics for collisions detection.</p><p>Go ahead and run the level and walk-through the scene. Test and make sure that the PC is behaving the way it is supposed to when you are navigating through the environment. When I test run my PC, I realized I had not attached Box colliders to all of the Planes. I also realized that there was no collider defined for my Shack. Take an inventory of such errors and when you stop testing make the needed corrections.</p></div>
