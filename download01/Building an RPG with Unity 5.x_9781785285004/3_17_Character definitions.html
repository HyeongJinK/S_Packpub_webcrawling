In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>In the Beginning</em></span>, we had defined the following class types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Barbarians</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Orcs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Magician/Wizards</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Zombies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Humans</p></li></ul></div><p>We won't be able to implement all of the character types due to time. The demonstration of the implementation of one or two character types should give you a good ground to develop your own character classes. After all, that is the overall objective of this book.</p><p>One of the main characters is of course the PC. Let's go ahead and concentrate on the implementation of the PC and then we can start defining and designing the Barbarian class, the Human class, and perhaps the Orc class.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>My character models are going to be from the Asset Store. You may either download the same characters or design your own. You can also use different type of character models. The point is to implement the character based on the specifications which will be defined in this chapter and beyond.</p></div><p>Let's take a look at some of the attributes that our player will have in general.</p></div>
