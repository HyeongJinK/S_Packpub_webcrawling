In short, it is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Your game design will dictate how the player character will act, advance, and so onâ€¦</p><p>There are three varieties of RPGs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tabletop</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Live Action</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Computer RPG (cRPG)</p></li></ul></div><p>Tabletop and pen-and-paper (PnP) RPGs are conducted through discussion in a small social gathering. There is usually a <span class="strong"><strong>Game Master</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GM</strong></span>) who describes the game world and its inhabitants. The other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. This is the format in which RPGs were first popularized, namely through <span class="strong"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>D&amp;D</strong></span>).</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Live Action Role Playing</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LARP</strong></span>) is played more like improvisational theatre. Participants act out their character's actions instead of describing them, and the real environment is used to represent the imaginary setting of the game world. Some live action LARPs use rock-paper-scissors or comparison of attributes to resolve symbolically, while other LARPs use physical combat with simulated arms. A movie can be considered as a simple LARP, the difference would be that in a movie all actions are scripted, and the players do not have to make decisions, whereas in a LARP, the characters can change the outcome of their actions based on their decisions.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Computer RPG </strong></span>(<span class="strong"><strong>cRPG</strong></span>s) are tabletop RPGs that have been translated into an electronic format. The early cRPGs influenced all electronic gaming, as well as spanning the role-playing video game genre. In short, a cRPG is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a main character immersed in a well-defined world.</p><p>Our book is going to concentrate on the design and development of a cRPG.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note3"></a>Note</h3><p>Going forward, when we state RPG in the book we are referring to cRPG.</p></div><p>Computer role-playing games take their roots from tabletop versions of the genre. Much of the same terminology, settings, and game mechanics have carried over from the original tabletop games. Some of these similarities include story-telling and narrative elements where, throughout the story the player character will continuously develop in skills and abilities to meet the objective of the game.</p></div>
