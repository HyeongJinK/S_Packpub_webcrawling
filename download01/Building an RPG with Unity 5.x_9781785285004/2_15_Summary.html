We have defined our levels, the setting of each level, the objective of each level and the outcome for each level.</p><p>We took the first level called Awakening and created the environment. We looked at how to use our assets and the Asset Store to incorporate 3D models in our scene. We also looked at how to plan the layout of the level. We introduced a third-person character controller into the scene to help us visualize how the level looks from the player's perspective and help us fine tune it as needed.</p><p>By the end of the chapter we also developed our <code class="literal">MainMenu</code> scene and our initial <code class="literal">GameMaster</code> script that will be used to glue the core of the game together.</p><p>In the next chapter we will start creating our player character and enhancing our <code class="literal">GameMaster</code> and <code class="literal">MainMenu</code> system.</p></div>
