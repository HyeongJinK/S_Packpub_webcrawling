<code class="literal">GameMaster</code>. The <code class="literal">uiController</code> game object should have <code class="literal">UIController.cs</code> attached and <code class="literal">_GameMaster</code> should have the following components attached: <code class="literal">GameMaster.cs</code> and an <code class="literal">AudioSource</code> component that will be used for the background music.</p><p>Have the <code class="literal">_GameMaster</code> GameObject selected in the <code class="literal">Hierarchy Window</code>; run the game. Select the <span class="emphasis"><em>Start Game</em></span> button. This will load the character customization scene. The <code class="literal">_GameMaster</code> GameObject should still be selected, if not, go ahead and select it from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Hierarchy Window</em></span>, do some of the character customization and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_05_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The first level should have been loaded with your character and the customization you have made to your character in the previous step. So visually, your character has retained all of the customization you have done, and from a data point of view, when you look at the <code class="literal">_GameMaster </code>GameObject in the Inspector Window, you will notice that the data has been saved properly as shown in the preceding figure.</p></div>
