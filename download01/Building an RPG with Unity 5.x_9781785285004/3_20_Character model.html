There are several approaches that can be taken. An easy way would be to have a predefined hero where the player does not have many options and choices when it comes to customization of the character. The other way would be to provide the player the ability to change and modify their character to an extent or fully. This all really depends on your budget!</p><p>We are going to do something in-between, to get the benefit of both worlds.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>You may use the Asset Store to download predefined characters that can be used as placeholders for your game while you create your own. You can even use some of the characters that are freely available through the Asset Store and modify them for your needs.</p></div><p>Once you have determined your character model, the next step is configuring it and customizing it for your game. The character model I have, can be visually modified to represent several unique characters.</p><p>You will need to study your character model carefully and understand how it is built so that you can modify it during design time and also during runtime if necessary.</p><p>For instance, this is how my character model looks like in its raw format:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This particular model has several visual elements attached for weapons, clothing and so onâ€¦ Your model may have been configured differently, if so, you will need to create your own attachment points and instantiate the weapons and or other character related assets accordingly:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Select your model and investigate the structure of your model. You will notice that there is a certain pattern and naming convention to the model hierarchy as show in the preceding screenshot. Some models might have animations attached, to check them you will need to select the model from the project window and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> tab in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window to get a list of the embedded animations for the model.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>Window select the Animations tab shown in the preceding screenshot, and notice the <span class="strong"><strong>Clips</strong></span> section for all animations developed for your character model, as indicated in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Notice that the animation clips have a start time and an end time. The actual character model is visually displayed at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>Window.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec6"></a>Rigging your model</h3></div></div></div><p>There might be times that you will need to Rig your model to make it suitable for your game. This can be achieved by selecting your model source, and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>Window selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> tab as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig </strong></span>tab, there are several options that you can apply to your model. Assuming that your character is of <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> type, you will need to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid Animation </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> if not already selected. The <span class="strong"><strong>Avatar Definition</strong></span> can also be either created from the model or assigned if you have an avatar defined. Finally, you can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Configure...</strong></span> button to see the configuration of the rigged model.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_03_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Notice from the preceding screenshot that your model has a mapping defined for its skeleton. If your model is of Humanoid type and if your model structure has been named properly, the system will automatically assign the correct bones and joints. If your naming is not per Unity specification, you can navigate your model structure and manually assign each point in the <span class="strong"><strong>Body</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Head</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Left Hand</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Right Hand</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Muscles &amp; Settings</strong></span> tab will enable you to define and restrict the movement of the joints for your model. These can be very useful and practical for creating more realistic movements for your characters. You can study these topics further on your own as they will require a whole chapter or two to cover them.</p></div></div>
