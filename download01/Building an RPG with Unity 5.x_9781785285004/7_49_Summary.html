The main objective of the chapter was to create a Heads Up Display (HUD) for our game.</p><p>We started out with a design concept that was of interest to us, and created a layout for our HUD before the actual implementation. Once we concluded what the HUD should look like, we started building the framework for it. We designed the three main sections of the HUD and referred to them as the following: <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelCharacterInfo</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelActiveItems</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelSpecialItems</em></span>.</p><p>Next, we started building the UI elements and the code necessary to make the panels work with our code. We started with the <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelCharacterInfo</em></span>, which represented the stats for our character player, which is a reference to the player's avatar, to the health and to the strength of the character. In the process, we had to create or update several of the scripts to work with the new UI.</p><p>Next we designed and developed the <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelActiveItems</em></span> panel. The implementation and approach to this specific panel was a little more involved. The purpose of this panel is to display all of the current active inventory items that the player has consumed. We had to make the panel scrollable, since we don't know how many items at any given time the player will be consuming. We created the necessary prefabs to be placeholders for the inventory items, and also the scripts that would make them work together.</p><p>The design for <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelSpecialItems</em></span> was very similar to that of the <span class="emphasis"><em>PanelActiveItems</em></span>, with two main differences. First, we had to make sure that the panel was vertical instead of horizontal, so we had to make sure that the proper configuration was applied. Secondly, the main functionality was different for this panel. The items displayed were supposed to be intractable, which meant that we had to create custom event handlers, apply the necessary values to the player character, and update the whole game state.</p><p>Once we were satisfied with the design of our HUD, we starting building the necessary scripts to integrate the UI elements with the GameMaster and other scripts. This was basically making sure that our UI was always reflecting the state of the object that was of interest to us. The health, stamina and inventory are the main items we used to communicate the concepts.</p><p>In the last section of the chapter, we concentrated on implementing the player's character movement and detecting the NPC's, and how to track the hit points between the player character and the NPC, which we had not done in previous chapters.</p><p>We also had to do some backtracking and make some adjustments to the Animation Controller we had defined for our player character, to have curves defined for our attack animation values based on the motion.</p><p>During the process, we had to solve the following challenges: How do we know if we are in close enough range that we can actually attack and hit the NPC character? How are we going to detect which NPC is closer to us? More importantly, how is the data going to be passed along from the action of attacking to the actual hit on the NPC?</p><p>We have done a lot in a short period of time, and in a small number of pages. Some of the functions have been left for the reader to solve on their own. For instance, we have not discussed how to delete an inventory item and so on. I felt that this was trivial, and that the reader will be sufficiently comfortable to implement the function on their own once they see the bigger scope and how to connect everything together.</p><p>With that said, let's move on to the next chapter.</p></div>
