Our game assets are defined by the scenes we describe for our game. For our RPG, we have described four unique scenes. Each one has been described in enough detail for us to get an idea of the types of assets we are going to require.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Environment assets</h3></div></div></div><p>The general theme of our game is going to be medieval. There are several ways to go about this. The first and preferred way would be to either create yourself the environment models by yourself or a teammate, second to find a freely available model that has been created by a third-party, or third to purchase the 3D Models that have been created by a third party.</p><p>The Asset Store is a great place for you to start hunting for great content if you do not have the ability to create your own 3D models. You can use the Asset Store to search for medieval themed environments that can be used for the game.</p><p>One of my favorites is called Medieval Environment. You might want to consider searching for a few more that are to your liking and taste.</p><p>Things to consider as part of your environment assets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Buildings</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Props and add-ons

Therefore, the next important game asset is going to be the characters themselves. The models that you need to define for your game are again heavily related to your story line and setting. The Asset Store provides a wealth of character models that you can download and use as a proof of concept for your game.</p><p>For our game, here are the characters that are required: humans, these will represent the hero as well as the villagers and other non-player character types of human. We need a Barbarian class, these are some of the characters that the hero must confront during the game play. We have the Orc character class which are animals in their own right.</p><p>You can either get the free models or the paid models to represent your characters. We will get more into the character assets in future chapters.</p></div></div>
