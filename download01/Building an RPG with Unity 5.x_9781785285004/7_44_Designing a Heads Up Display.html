The HUD is the interface through which your players can interact with the virtual world and also receive feedback from the virtual world environment. As with everything else that we have designed so far, the HUD design is also heavily related to the type and the needs of the game you are trying to make.</p><p>For instance, an RTS (Real Time Strategy) will have a very different type of HUD design then an FPS (First Person Shooter), and than an RPG (Role Playing Game). They will have some things in common, but the way they are designed is going to be very distinct, as well as some of the features and functionality.</p><p>We could have a whole book just on the design and development of user interfaces and how to approach them in a scientific manner. But that is outside the scope of this book, and we are concerned with the theories.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec51"></a>Basic information for a HUD</h3></div></div></div><p>Any simple heads up display will have, at a minimum, a way to display the following information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Basics information about the player character</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Health</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mana</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Strength</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level, etc</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Current inventory items consumed by the player character</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Current weapon used by the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Current armour used by the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Available potions and/or health</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Feedback from the game environment</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Anything useful pertaining to the game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Power ups</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level ups, etc</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's go ahead and design our HUD. Once again we will start with a simple framework and slowly build on top of it, as we need to.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec52"></a>Our design</h3></div></div></div><p>Taking everything into consideration, let's go ahead and design a HUD that will be useful for our game, and at the same time we will keep it simple but useful. We should have a HUD that will display the basic player character information in a manner in which it does not block the gameplay, but at the same time gives critical information to the player regarding their character's state.</p><p>We should also design a way to display the current inventory items that the player has activated to be used, such as the weapon, or the armour. Finally, we should also have a simple way for the player to use any health packets and or potions they might have during gameplay.</p><p>Here is a quick sketch of what I want my HUD to look like. Again, you are free and in fact I encourage you to come up with your own design.</p><p>

</p><p>I have roughly marked what I would like my HUD to look like during gameplay.</p><p>Notice that I have kept it simple. In the top left corner, I have placed the immediate information that the player will need to have, such as their health and perhaps their strength.</p><p>In the bottom left corner, I have placed a scrollable panel that will list all of the active inventory items that the player may have active on their player character, and on the right side of the screen I have three slots that will be used for immediate access to things such as health packets and or potions that the player might need to use during their gameplay.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec53"></a>HUD framework</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we have an understanding of what we want our UI to look like, let's actually start implementing it in Unity. We need to create a new canvas to hold our HUD. To create this, right-click in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Hierarchy Window</em></span> and select <span class="emphasis"><em>UI | Canvas</em></span>. Rename the new <span class="emphasis"><em>Canvas</em></span> GameObject to <span class="emphasis"><em>CanvasHUD</em></span>.</p><p>Go ahead and implement the necessary UI sections as outlined. We will need three main panels for each section indicated in the preceding diagram.</p><p>These are the three main panels for each section, as indicated in the design:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Character information in the top left screen corner</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Active inventory items in the bottom left corner of the screen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A special items panel in the right mid-section of the screen</p></li></ul></div><p>Create each panel by right-clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy Window</strong></span> and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>UI | Panel</strong></span>. Make sure the panels are a child of the <span class="strong"><strong>CanvasHUD</strong></span> GameObject. Rename each panel accordingly. I have named mine <span class="strong"><strong>PanelCharacterInfo</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>PanelActiveItems</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>PanelSpecialItems</strong></span>.</p><p>
