The main objective of the chapter was to introduce you to the fundamental of networking in Unity by implementing two samples.</p><p>We start the chapter by giving some of the challenges that you will face as a game designer and developer for a multiplayer game. One of the main questions raised is whether you really need to invest the time and energy to create a multiplayer mode for your game. Assuming you really do want or need to create a multiplayer game, we start looking at the different types of multiplayer games popular today.</p><p>We start with our first example of a simplified multiplayer game. The multiplayer game we develop are real time, that is, all clients are synchronized with one another based on the activity on each active player's state. That is, the position, rotation, movement, and other important data needs to be synchronized with all clients connected to the game session.</p><p>We look at the fundamentals of Unity's networking components such as the Network Manager, Network Manager HUD, Network Identity, and Network Transform. These are the base components that are used to illustrate multiplayer programming in Unity. Once we understand what these components are used for, we start with a simple sample.</p><p>We create a simple tank game that demonstrating how to put together all of the essential components for a multiplayer game. We create the necessary player character prefab with the appropriate network enabled scripts and components. We also create the non-player character prefab with its own network-enabled scripts. The game demonstrates how to spawn, synchronize between the player characters and non-player characters.</p><p>During the construction of the tank game, we cover how to synchronize variables and use network callbacks that are crucial for the development of a multiplayer game. We also cover what <span class="emphasis"><em>Commands</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>ClientRPC</em></span> calls are and how to use them properly.</p><p>Next, we apply what you have learned to the RPG characters we developed in previous chapters. We used the existing prefabs as a base and extended them to include the networking components and create new network-enabled scripts to handle the character movement, character customization, and NPC movement scripts.</p><p>One of the crucial elements that is covered is the synchronization of each player character's inventory items visually with the rest of the players. We close the chapter by the testing and discussing how to debug your code on the client and the server while developing your multiplayer game.</p></div>
