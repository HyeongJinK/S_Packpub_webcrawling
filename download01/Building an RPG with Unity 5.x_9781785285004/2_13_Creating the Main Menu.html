<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"></a>Creating the Main Menu</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now is a good time to create the starting point for our game. Go ahead and save the current scene. We are going to make a new scene that will be used as the starting point of our game. To create the new scene, you will need to select <span class="strong"><strong>File | New Scene</strong></span>. Go ahead and save the scene. I called my scene Main Menu.</p><p>Now we have a clear canvas that we can work with to create our Main Menu. In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Hierarchy Window</em></span>, right-click and select <span class="strong"><strong>UI | Panel</strong></span>. This will create a Canvas GameObject and an EventSystem GameObject and place them in your <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window. You will notice that the <span class="strong"><strong>Panel</strong></span> UI object is a child of the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. All UI elements will be a child of a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_02_017.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Your Hierarchy should look something like the precedingÂ .</p><p>There are several key aspects that we want to make sure are set properly. These are namely on the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas GameObject</strong></span>. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas GameObject</strong></span> and look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector Window</strong></span>.</p><p>For this particular Canvas, make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Render Mode </strong></span>is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span>. The next property you need to check is the <span class="strong"><strong>UI Scale Mode</strong></span>. Change this to <span class="strong"><strong>Scale With Screen Size</strong></span>. This will make sure that the UI will always be scaled to the screen size of the device that the game is being run in.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>For best results, you will want to create multiple menus for different device types.</p></div><p>So for now, let's go ahead and create a button that will basically load our level called Awakening.</p><p>Right click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Panel Object</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy Window</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>UI | Button</strong></span>. This will place a button on the Canvas as a child to the Panel object. The parent child relationships are important to consider when you are building your user interface. When you place a UI element as part of a child to another UI element, the child will be scaled and moved according to the Parent's scale and location.</p><p>You can learn more about UI development in <span class="emphasis"><em>Chapter 5</em></span> of the book <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Game Programming: Using C# and Unity 3D.</em></span>
</p><p>We will spend time fine tuning our menu in the future chapters. Change the caption of the button to <code class="literal">Start Game</code>. It is also a good idea to name your scene object appropriately just to keep things nice and organized. I have changed the name of the button to <code class="literal">butStartGame</code>. This can be done by selecting the Button object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy Window</strong></span> and changing the name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector Window</strong></span>.</p></div>
