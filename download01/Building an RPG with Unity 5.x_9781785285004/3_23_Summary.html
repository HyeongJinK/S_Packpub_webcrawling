We discussed the different character definitions we are going to be using for our game, looked at the base character class attributes that will be shared by all of our characters, created the <code class="literal">BaseCharacter</code> class to be used later in the game, discussed the primary states our character will have in the game and how to implement them using the Animator Controller.</p><p>We looked at how to rig our character model to be prepared for the Mecanim system and how to use the Mecanim system to create animation and state diagrams that will determine how the character is behaving during game play. Then we implemented our initial character controller script that handles the state of our character. This gave us the opportunity to look at the Blend Trees and transition from one state to the next using parameters. Looked at how to modify animation clips if there is a need for it.</p><p>Finally looked at Inverse Kinematics that will help our character behave more realistically in the game environment.</p><p>By the end of the chapter you should have a good grasp of all of the different components that are working together to make your character look, behave, and move in the game environment.</p><p>In the next chapter we will be introducing non-character behaviors.</p></div>
