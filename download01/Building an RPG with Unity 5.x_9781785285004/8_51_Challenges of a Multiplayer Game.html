It just adds a whole lot of complexity and extra requirements and specifications that you will need to start worrying about. But if you must, then you must!</p><p>You probably know by now that creating even the simplest multiplayer game will have its own challenges that you will need to address as the game designer. There are different types of online multiplayer game design:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Real-time multiplayer games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Turn-based multiplayer games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Asynchronous multiplayer games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Local multiplayer games</p></li></ul></div><p>The most challenging out of all the different types of multiplayer games is Real-time multiplayer gaming. This is because all players have to be synchronized in a proper and effective way with the latest game state at any given time.</p><p>That is, if we have Player A perform a specific action, Player B will see the action at the same time on his or her screen. Now, consider we have another player join, say Player C, Player A and B will need to synchronize with Player C and in turn Player C will need to synchronize its own environment with Player A's and Player B's state.</p><p>Not just the actual position/rotation of the players has to be synchronized, but also all of the player data will need to be synchronized. Now, imagine what happens when you multiply this by 100 or 1000 or 1,000,000 connected players.</p><p>For a real-world multiplayer game, what we are going to cover here is not enough, and what Unity provides out of the box is not enough either. Chances are that you will need to write your own server-side code to handle the player data.</p><p>Now, you can see the challenge involved in designing and developing multiplayer games, we can start by building our first multiplayer game.</p></div>
