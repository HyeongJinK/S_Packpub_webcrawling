The following is a list of attributes that are going to be part of the Base character class:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Character class name</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Character class description</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>List of attributes
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Strength</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dexterity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Endurance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Intelligence</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Social standing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Agility</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Alertness</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Vitality</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Willpower</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></li></ul></div><p>The attributes you define for your characters depend on the character type, but there are going to be some similarities between all character attributes, we would like to implement these similarities in a base class that will be shared with all character classes.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>The list provided is just a sample, and you can add or subtract as you see fit.</p></div><p>Let's keep things simple, we will use only the four primary statistics for now:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Strength</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> This is a measure of how physically strong a character is. Strength controls the maximum weight the character can carry, melee attack and/or damage, and sometimes hit points. Armor and weapons might also have a Strength requirement.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Defense</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> This is a measure of how resilient a character is. Defense usually decreases taken damage by either a percentage or a fixed amount per hit.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Dexterity</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> This is a measure of how agile a character is. Dexterity controls attack and movement speed and accuracy, as well as evading an opponent's attack.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Intelligence</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> This is a measure of a character's problem-solving ability. Intelligence often controls a character's ability to comprehend foreign languages and their skill in magic. In some cases, intelligence controls how many skill points the character gets at "level up". In some games, it controls the rate at which experience points are earned, or the amount needed to level up. This is sometimes combined with wisdom and/or willpower.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Health</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> This determines if the character is alive or dead.</p></li></ul></div><p>The attributes listed will be inherited by all character classes. Now let's put this into code. Create a new C# script and name it <code class="literal">BaseCharacter.cs</code>. Open the script and place the following code in file:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine; &#13;
using System.Collections; &#13;
 &#13;
public class BaseCharacter &#13;
{ &#13;
   private string name; &#13;
   private string description; &#13;
 &#13;
   private float strength; &#13;
   private float defense; &#13;
   private float dexterity; &#13;
   private float intelligence; &#13;
   private float health; &#13;
 &#13;
   public string NAME &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.name; } &#13;
      set { this.name = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public string DESCRIPTION &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.description; } &#13;
      set { this.description = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public float STRENGTH &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.strength; } &#13;
      set { this.strength = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public float DEFENSE &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.defense; } &#13;
      set { this.defense = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public float DEXTERITY &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.dexterity; } &#13;
      set { this.dexterity = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public float INTELLIGENCE &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.intelligence; } &#13;
      set { this.intelligence = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
 &#13;
   public float HEALTH &#13;
   { &#13;
      get { return this.health; } &#13;
      set { this.health = value; } &#13;
   } &#13;
