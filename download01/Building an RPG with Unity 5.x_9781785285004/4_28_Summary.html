<span class="emphasis"><em>Chapter 4</em></span> was very involved. We covered some very important topics and concepts in the chapter that can be used and enhanced for your games. We started the chapter by looking into how to customize your player character. The concepts you take away from the section can be applied to a wide variety of scenarios.</p><p>We look at how to understand the structure of your character model so that you can better determine the customization methods. These are the different types of weapons, clothing, armour, shields and so on...</p><p>We then looked at how to create a user interface to help enable us with the customization of our player character during gameplay. We also learned that the tool we developed can be used to quickly create several different character models (customized) and store them as Prefabs for later use! Great time saver!!! We also learned how to preserve the state of our player character after customization for gameplay.</p><p>We looked at the Non-Player Characters next. We went through the basics of setting up the NPC with the different necessary components. We then looked at how to create a Navmesh and how to work with Navmesh Agent and Pathfinding using the Navmesh.</p><p>We created a new Animator Controller for the NPC. We created a 2D Freeform Cartesian blend tree that was used for the animation of the NPC. We saw how to create multiple layers in the animation controller and enabling IK for difference regions of the humanoid skeleton. We created the initial NPC AI script to detect and determine if the player is close enough for it to make a move and/or attack. Finally, we created new scripts to make interaction between the NPC and the player character possible.</p><p>By the end of the chapter you should have a good grasp of how everything is inter-related and have an idea of how to approach your project.</p><p>In the next chapter we will create a better way to manage our game state.</p></div>
