</p><p>The game takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after a resource war over natural resources that ended in a nuclear holocaust in 2077. The setting is a post-apocalyptic retro-future, covering a region that includes Boston, Massachusetts and other parts of New England known as <span class="strong"><strong>The Commonwealth</strong></span>.</p><p>The story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077. The player's character takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging exactly 210 years later, on October 23, 2287.</p><p>The game takes place in an alternate version of history that sees the 1940's and 1950's aesthetics, design and technology advance in the directions imagined at the time. The resulting universe is thus a retro-futuristic one, where the technology has evolved enough to produce laser weapons, manipulate genes and create nearly autonomous artificial intelligence, but all within the confines of 1950's solutions like the widespread use of atomic power and vacuum tubes, as well as having the integrated circuitry of the digital age.</p><p>The overall setting of the game is that of the 1950s, from the architecture, to the advertisements and general living styles and so on.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"></a>Divinity: Original Sin</h3></div></div></div><p>
