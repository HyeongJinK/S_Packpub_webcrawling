<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec8"></a>Characteristics of an RPG</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting, which is divided into a number of quests or levels. Players typically control one or more characters by issuing commands, which are then performed by player characters based on their defined abilities and attributes. Throughout the game, these attributes increase or decrease and set the personality of the character.</p><p>An RPG usually also has more complex and dynamic interaction mechanics defined and developed between the player character and the world which they are immersed within. These include the interaction with the world environment and also other non-character players defined within the world. Due to these factors, there is usually more time allocated to design and develop the code base which deals with the behavior and artificial-intelligence (AI) handling such events throughout the game.</p><p>Key elements of an RPG:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Story and setting</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Exploration and quests</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Items and inventory</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Character development</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Experience and levels</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Combat</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>User interface and graphics</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec6"></a>Story and setting</h3></div></div></div><p>The premise of most role-playing games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa.</p><p>The game world tends to be set in a historical, fantasy, or science fiction universe, which allows the players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth.</p><p>As stated previously, RPGs are heavily invested in storytelling. This is one of the main, key entertaining factors of the genre. Due to this fact, when you are developing your RPG, you will need to pay close attention to how you develop your story, and the characters that are within your story. This in turn translates into the kind of environments and settings you will have for your game and characters within the game.</p><p>Traditionally, RPGs progress the plot based on decisions that the player character makes during gameplay. This puts a great deal of pressure on the game designer who needs to be able to integrate such forks in the gameplay with the main storyline of the game. This also raises the issue of how to program the game to take into consideration all the different paths within the story.</p><p>To make the game more interesting and attractive, the game designer can introduce special triggers within the story to make it more interesting or challenging. This is usually done by introducing new characters and/or areas to discover within the existing level.</p><p>The following is a simplified description of the storyline and the setting we are going to be building for our cRPG.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec0"></a>A glimpse at our cRPG story</h4></div></div></div><p>Once upon a time there was a great kingdom, ruled by the great King Zazar. The ruler of the kingdom was a generous lord to his subjects. The kingdom under the rule of Zazar was peaceful and prosperous, however, over time internal family rivalries and struggles have caused cracks in the strong bond that keeps the kingdom intact.</p><p>Due to mysterious events, the great king has decided to move his family away from the kingdom and leave his son with one of his trusted, wise elders. The kingdom was never the same. Until now!</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec7"></a>Exploration and quests</h3></div></div></div><p>The whole idea behind an RPG is the ability for the player to have the freedom to explore the world which they have been immersed into. The more well defined the world is, the more interesting it will be for the player to explore, and in return retain their curiosity and engagement throughout the gameplay.</p><p>This is achieved by the narrative of the story developed for the RPG. Players will be specifically given the opportunity to walk around the world and explore their surroundings in order to meet their objectives.</p><p>In an open world RPG, the player is free to roam in the world after they have met their objective set by the storyline. In such cases, the player can still explore any area which is no longer needed for the continuation of the quest, but they can spend time exploring the area and maybe meet some other non-player characters that they had not previously met while completing their mission. But generally speaking this is not done by the player, once they meet their objective they are eager to move on to the next quest, hence the question is; how much time and effort do the game designers and developers apply to a region after the main objective is met? The answer would be not much.</p><p>Historically, the player follows a linear-sequence of quests in order to realize their goals and objectives within the game. To make the game more engaging, the developer can introduce mini-quests within the main plot of the game at that particular location to give the player the ability to explore and gain more skills and or abilities. Since these are not part of the main storyline, they can be triggered any time a player enters a specific area.</p><p>For instance, assume the player has completed the main objective of the level, and is ready to move on to the next objective. Now, imagine that we have created an open world environment where the user can revisit the world anytime they choose. If the player decides to go back and explore a certain area of the world they just completed, and they happen to trigger the event to launch this mini-quest, wouldn't that be a great surprise for the player? Keep in mind that these mini-quests should not affect the main storyline, but they can be used to enhance the player's experience. These types of decisions are important when you are developing your game. If they choose not to take on the challenge you should not penalize them, except if you want to be really mean J.</p><p>Quests may involve defeating one or many enemies, rescuing a non-player character, item fetch quests, or location puzzles such as mysteriously locked doors.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec1"></a>A glimpse at our exploration and quests</h4></div></div></div><p>Our game will have a total of four quests. Each quest will have unique objectives that the player will need to complete. The design and development of each quest will be discussed throughout the book as we progress.</p><p>Here is a list of the levels we will be designing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Awakening</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Village</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Broken Forest â€“ The Horizon</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Kingdom</p></li></ul></div><p>The game will start by immersing the player in the environment where our hero will be given the basic training he will need to complete his mission.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec8"></a>Inventory system</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the main functions and features of an RPG is the inventory system. Throughout the game, the user will come across a vast number of collectable items that can be used for different purposes within the game to help them progress through the journey. Therefore, RPGs needs to provide mechanics to help the player store, retrieve, and organize the content relevant to their journey.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>When the player is progressing through their journey in an RPG, they interact with the world they are immersed in. The storyline of the game usually forces the player to interact with the surrounding world and other non-player characters. These interactions are usually in the form of some sort of an exchange. Whether this exchange is done through narration to provide the player with a better sense of the quest, or real exchange in terms of items is up to the game designers and developers.</p><p>The game needs a way to keep track of all the interactions between the player character and everything and everyone else. One system that is used to keep track of this interaction is the inventory system.</p><p>During the gameplay, players usually start off as a very simple character and part of the gameplay is to elevate their character by exploring the world and collecting items that will help them increase their skills and abilities.</p><p>For instance, a player can start their journey with very basic clothes. Throughout the quest, they will either interact with a non-character player, such as a merchant who will provide them with a better set of clothes, and or some sort of a weapon to get them started. These items will be stored and managed by the inventory system.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The simplicity or the complexity of the inventory system will be defined by the complexity of the game and the complexity of the characters within the game. In our game we will be designing and developing a generic inventory system that can be applied to many different types of items.</p><p>Here are some items that are usually collected in a game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Weapons</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Armor</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Clothing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Special Objects</p></li></ul></div><p>Some of the items are collected or discovered by world exploration, and some of the items are specifically traded through the game. If you are setting up a trade system in a game, then you will need to provide the mechanics for the trade. A trade usually takes place while interacting with a non-player character, usually a merchant, and it will use a special window to enable the interaction of the trade to take place.</p><p>There is usually a cost associated with any trade. In general, there is a cost associated with everything the player does within the game, and the cost is usually either increasing the player-character's ability and/or experience, or decreasing it. This can get pretty complex if you dig deep into it.</p><p>The main point to keep in mind is that everything that the player will need to collect and/or manage will be done through the inventory system. Hence, this is one of the most critical features that you will need to put effort into as a game designer and developer.</p><p>One other element that can be used to enhance the gameplay for the player, and push them to strategize their quest, is to limit the number of items they can carry in their inventory.</p><p>For instance, in real life, a warrior will have limited ability to carry different types of weapons. Let's assume, that in the real world, a warrior can carry a maximum of five different types of weapon at any given time. Now, in the game world, there might be 20 different types of weapon. Do you allow the player to carry all 20 different types when they discover them? Or are you going to limit them to five?</p><p>These are small things that make the gameplay more interesting when planned out properly. There is more to an inventory system, and we will take a look at it in more detail in later chapters.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec9"></a>Character development</h3></div></div></div><p>As with any other part of the RPG development, character attributes and actions are highly defined by the storyline of the game. These actions in turn are performed indirectly within the game, when the player commands the character to perform a specific task.</p><p>For instance, in a given RPG there is going to be at least a couple of character classes. The following are some sample class types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Barbarians</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Orcs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Magicians/Wizards</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Zombies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Humans</p></li></ul></div><p>Each character class might even have subclasses of their own with its own uniquely defined attributes. Again, this will be tightly coupled to your storyline for your RPG.</p><p>For instance, the player character is technically the hero of our story and of the game. The hero is usually of a certain character class, let's assume the hero is part of the Human Class.</p><p>The Human Class or Race then will have some specific characteristics that will be inherited by the player character or any other non-player character of the same type or class.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note4"></a>Note</h3><p>The character class and race usually determines the abilities of a character within the game, which then define the types of actions the character can perform.</p></div><p>The strength of a character within the game is defined by the character class it belongs to and what type of actions it can perform. The performance of a character is defined by the value of the attributes defined within the character's class and race.</p><p>For instance, if we take two different character classes and compare them side-by-side such as a Human and an Orc, the Orc will have far superior strength and brute force then the human. However, the human, may have higher intelligence and problem-solving skills which will out-rate the strength of the Orc if applied properly.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This is another key area where an RPG designer will have to spend a lot of time defining and specifying the design and development of the characters within the game. The sky is the limit when it comes to designing and defining your characters, but there are some key attributes that you will need to consider for any RPG.</p><p>Most RPGs allow the player to modify their characters before the game starts or even during gameplay. By default, every character class will have some default attributes and the player is allowed to adjust the values based on some modifier. The basic fundamental features allowed for modification are the sex, class, or race of a character.</p><p>These days, character customization is one of the main features that players are looking for in a given RPG. Some games, allow you to modify every aspect of the physical appearance of the player-character, such as the skin color, the eye color, the hair style, and so forth.</p><p>It all comes down to the budget and the resources that are available to you during the production of the game. In some games, you can also introduce ethical attributes into the characteristics of the character. For instance, if you allow the ability to kill or rob innocents by standards within the game, then the player will become less liked by the friendly non-player characters and they may not be as friendly or helpful as needed to complete your quest. In other words, you will live by the consequences of your actions!</p><p>As a final takeaway, character classes define your character attributes and hence define your character's strength and weaknesses. These physical attributes can be simplified into the following: dexterity and strength, which determine the performance of a character during battle!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Experience and levelling</h3></div></div></div><p>To engage the player and to get them hooked on the game, game designers use mechanics to enhance the performance of the player-character. The progress is what is termed Levelling or Experience in RPGs.</p><p>Levelling and experience are key elements of any role-playing game. A good levelling or experience tree will be defined for any RPG. This allows the player to develop their avatar through gameplay and become functionally more powerful by gaining more skills, points and other resources necessary to complete their quest.</p><p>To acquire new weapons, armor, clothing, and/or any other gameplay items defined in the world, the player will need to meet some specific thresholds within the game. These thresholds can be a combination of the player's acquired experience points, financial gains, and or combat experience. There is no right or wrong when it comes to designing any of these hierarchies and or systems. You will need to see which one works for your specific needs and how to best apply them.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>In RPGs, the progress of the character-player is measured by counting some defined attributes specified by the game designer. Usually the advancements are defined by the player completing a certain task to get experience points, and slowly the tasks and the point rewards are increased throughout the game. The player then can use the experience points to enhance his or her avatar within the game.</p><p>Again, this is highly integrated with the storyline, Character Classes and or Race the player has selected. Some common ways to acquire points are by killing enemies, combating non-player characters of no importance, and performing quests that have been defined within the game.</p><p>Just like in real-life, the more you play and apply your skills, the more experienced you become. The accumulation of your experience then will allow you to acquire better weapons and/or armor to strengthen your attack or defense for the next quest. Some games might give the player 100+ points and allow the player to distribute the points across the available character attributes for their avatar. Sometimes, the game automatically applies all of the experience to a specific area such as strength.</p><p>Gaining experience will also allow the user to unlock more features and skills to be acquired by the player in during gameplay. This is a great way to monetize your games. In reality, most free games use this principal. They provide the basics of the world and the character for free, and they monetize the game through what is called In-Game purchases to increase either resources and/or character performance.</p><p>How is this implemented? Just like the inventory system, we need a way to keep track of the progress of the player's skills. This is usually done through a Skill Tree. Learning or acquiring a particular skill in the tree will unlock more powerful skills and give the player the ability to utilize the skills in the game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"></a>Combat system</h3></div></div></div><p>Time for battle! This is the moment every player looks forward to during their journey; to kill the boss, the bad guy, the evil war lord! Every RPG has some type of combat or battle component built into the gameplay. This is when the player gets to use all of their acquired skills and experience to destroy the opponent, or be destroyed by the opponent J depending on how the day goes.</p><p>Traditionally there have been three basic types of RPG combat systems. What type of combat system you choose to implement for your game is going to have a big impact on the gameplay and also the implementation of the game.</p><p>The three types are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Traditional turn based system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Real-time combat</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Real-time with pause</p></li></ul></div><p>Historically, role-playing games used to implement turn-based combat systems. This type of combat system is as follows: only one character could have acted at a given time. During this time, all other characters had to remain still. In other words, they could not have taken any action. This type of combat system is designed to put more emphasis on rewarding strategic planning.</p><p>The next type would be Real-time with pause combat system. This type of combat system is also strictly turn-based, but with a catch. If the player waits more than a certain period of time to make a move or issue a command, the game will automatically pass on the command to the other player. This in turn will allow the other player, such as the enemy to take a turn and attack the player.</p><p>In this book we will be using a real-time combat system. Real-time combat imports features from action games and creates a hybrid of action and RPG game genre. Action RPG combat systems combine the RPG mechanics of role-playing with the direct, reflex-oriented, arcade-style, real-time combat systems of action games, instead of the more traditional battle systems of RPGs.</p><p>In action RPGs, the player has direct control over the character's movement and actions in combat, and an attack button must be pressed to attack enemies in real-time. Action RPGs most often use arcade-style hack &amp; slash combat systems, though many also use fighting, brawling, or shooting mechanics.</p><p>The action RPG genre was largely pioneered by Japanese developers during the early-mid 1980s. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto adapted elements from several different types of action RPGs for home consoles and in 1986 created The Legend of Zelda franchise, which is responsible for popularizing the action RPG genre in the Western world since the late 1980s.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note5"></a>Note</h3><p>Shigeru Miyamoto is best known as the creator of many of Nintendo's most beloved characters and franchises including Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, and many others. He was also the chief designer of Nintendo's Touch! Generation console series, which includes the Nintendo DS, Wii, and 3DS.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"></a>User interface and graphics</h3></div></div></div><p>The question arises, how do we present our game world to the player? What kind of user interface are we going to provide for our game? What kind of view are we going to allow for our game? Are we going to design our world to be viewed as a top-down camera view? Are we going to create an isometric view of the world? Or are we going to create a first-person or a third-person perspective of our world?</p><p>Answering these questions is crucial, as when you are designing your game assets you will need to understand how they will be viewed in the game world. For instance, when designing your characters and or 3D models for the game, if you know that you are going to be using isometric view, then you will approach your modeling differently to, for instance, when you are designing for a first-person or third-person camera.</p><p>In our game, we will be using third-person camera for the presentation of our world.</p><p>The next question would be how to provide critical information to the player in a simple and meaningful fashion. Role playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information, and frequently make use of windowed interfaces to arrange the data for the player. This is usually designed and implemented through a <span class="strong"><strong>Heads Up Display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>).</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The HUD is frequently used to simultaneously display several pieces of information including the main character's health, items, and indication of game progression. You can think of the HUD as the access point for all the information the user will be required to have access to and interact with during gameplay.</p><p>The design of the HUD is crucial for RPG games. Typically, there are a few key data elements that you would like to continuously communicate with the player throughout the gameplay, these data points are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Health</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Energy</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Stamina</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Active weapon</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Active shield</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Special items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Number of lives</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Access to main menu</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Access to inventory</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Access to skills</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>Once again, the design of your HUD is derived from the type of the game you are designing and also the type of information that will be required to be available to the player during gameplay.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Since, most RPGs collect and store large amounts of data for the player-character, it is very important to create an easy to use yet clean HUD.</p><p>A very important thing to remember when designing a HUD is it should never overpower the screen or become a distraction. It usually takes a few stabs to come up with a great HUD design for your game. From initial artistic concepts to the actual implementation and testing by gamers to get some feedback before finalizing the design and internal workings.</p><p>At the end of the day, the HUD is supposed to simplify the gameplay for the player, and not make it more confusing. Today, many games are moving away from the traditional HUDs, and they are leaning more towards cinematic and extremely simplistic experiences during the gameplay. This enables the game designer to immerse the player into the world and not to distract them with a constant static HUD.</p><p>Creating a HUD that will fit into the gameplay and style of your game is essential. While a feature-rich HUD may be great for some games, a simplistic HUD can be just as effective or more. It all depends on the player experience you want. So when you're ready to create the HUD for your next game, make sure you're designing the HUD to enhance the player's experience and never give the player an overload of information.</p></div></div>
