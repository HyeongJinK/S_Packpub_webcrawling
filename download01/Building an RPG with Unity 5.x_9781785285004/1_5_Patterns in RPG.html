His objective was to see if there existed special patterns in existing RPGs, and he approached this by examining specific patterns in the successful games of the genre to detect and identify them.</p></div><p>In this section we will be looking at some of the design patterns that have been identified and that can be utilized for your own games.</p><p>Anytime you start a new project, regardless of what type of a project, you need to have some clear idea of what exactly it is that you are trying to accomplish. This is even truer for designing a game. Since designing a game has many different components to it, you will need to identify what your game is going to be about. Some questions to start the thinking process are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>What are you trying to accomplish?</p></li><li><p>What mood are you trying to evoke?</p></li><li><p>What do the characters do?</p></li><li><p>What does the player or players, in a multiplayer environment, do?</p></li><li><p>What kind of activities do you want to reward and what kinds of rewards do you want to provide?</p></li><li><p>What age group does your game target?</p></li><li><p>Is your game going to have cinematic sequences?</p></li><li><p>Will the game and the story extend with supplemental assets?</p></li></ol></div><p>These are all important questions that will affect the design of your game. As you read this chapter and the book in general, keep a pen and paper handy so that you can write down all ideas that flash in your mind. This way you can keep track of all your thoughts and if you need to expand on them you can at a later time.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"></a>Terminology</h3></div></div></div><p>Every discipline has its own terminology; the following is a list of terminology that is used in RPG games. It is a good idea to take a moment and study them to expand your vocabulary or to refresh your memory:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Attribute</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A gauge that is a common characteristic, a commonality.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A person in a game portrayed by a player, including possibly the Game Master.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Characteristics</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> An aspect of a character. A character's name, height, age, beauty, and strength are some possible characteristics.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Common Characteristics</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A characteristic common to all characters of a given type in a game. A character's name, height, age, beauty, and strength are frequently common characteristics.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Conflict</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> Contention between characters, players, and/or game forces, especially contention that shapes the game's plot. This includes oppositions between two or more players concerning what facts should be introduced into a game world.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Contest</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A conflict that is resolved through mechanical means.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Derived Attributes</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> An attribute whose value is determined by a formula. Typically, the formula uses other attribute values to generate a number.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Drama</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> An outcome based purely on story consideration. Outcomes in a drama are exclusively determined by what would be most entertaining for the participants.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Flaw</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A selected characteristic that is specifically not also a gauge. A character either has a flaw or he does not. Flaws are structurally very similar to gifts. But, flaws are generally considered detrimental to a character rather than beneficial.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fortune</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> An outcome that is at least partly based on random factors. This may include rolling dice, drawing cards, or some other random value generator.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game Master</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> Traditionally, a player assigned responsibilities and who manages the game flow. With computer RPGs, the Game Master (GM) is the glue that holds everything together.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gauge</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A graduated value generally associated with a name. Commonly the graduated values are numeric values.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gift:</strong></span> A selected characteristic that is specifically not a gauge. A character either has a gift or not. In general, gifts are considered beneficial to a character's well-being.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Karma:</strong></span> An outcome based on non-random value comparison. A karma-based contest directly compares two values to determine an outcome.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Non-Player Character (NPC)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> Any character portrayed by the Game Master as part of the role.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Optional Characteristics</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A characteristic that is not common to all characters of a given type.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Player:</strong></span> Any person participating in a role-playing game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Player Character (PC):</strong></span> a character portrayed by any player while not assuming the role of a Game Master.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Primary Attribute</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> An attribute whose value is set directly by a player rather than being derived by a formula from other attributes. Commonly, primary attributes are used in formulae to determine the values of Derived Attributes but their own values are not determined by formulas. Typically, they are generated by random numbers or set by spending some resources.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rank:</strong></span> The specific value of a gauge skill, handicap, or ranked trait. Also used as an adjective in place of gauge when describing such skills and traits.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ranked Trait:</strong></span> A trait that is also a gauge.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Selected Characteristic</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>:</strong></span> A characteristic selected from a predefined list of choices.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shared Gauge:</strong></span> A gauge that is shared by many characters.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Skill:</strong></span> a selected characteristic that is also a gauge and is generally considered beneficial to a character.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Trait:</strong></span> A characteristic made up by a player without drawing it from a predefined list of choices.</p></li></ul></div><p>To get a better understanding about the relationships between the attributes and characteristics, we have put together a visual diagram to make it explainable:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785285004/graphics/image_01_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"></a>Contest Tree</h3></div></div></div><p>The intent of a Contest Tree is to provide a mechanical means to create rising tension within a game. This is also known as <span class="strong"><strong>Escalating Conflict</strong></span>.</p><p>Contest trees are high-level conflict resolution systems made up of many levels of contests arranged in a hierarchical fashion. The way they work, is that lower level contests feed into the higher level contests and therefore affect the outcome of the higher level contests.</p><p>In other words, the higher level contest could be to kill the big boss, but before you get to the big boss, there could be other mini battles that you will have to complete, and the outcome of the mini battles will drive the outcome of the big battle. To give a simple example would be by the amount of experience points you have gained before reaching the main boss.</p><p>Since the higher level contests are somehow related to the lower level contest, players do pay attention to the outcome of the higher level contests, therefore, tensions arise concerning the eventual success or failure of a higher level contest as a lower level contest succeeds or fails.</p><p>It is best to use a Contest Tree when you want to create a sense of rising tension in your game. This can be achieved by applying different mechanics as the player progresses through the levels. Creating suspense in a cRPG is very simple as you have a lot of control in the way levels and gameplay are designed. Since we have the ability to create our 3D worlds as we like, it would be easy to incorporate suspense into the game.</p><p>A few key points for creating tension in your game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The hero and enemy should be evenly matched.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The hero and enemy should both periodically fail in their attempts, providing they are worthy adversaries.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The hero and enemy successes and failures are never so great that all hope of success of attaining the high level goals is eliminated from either side.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A highlight concerning Contest Trees is that it can only resolve high-level conflicts dealing with the mechanical inputs by the system. That is, if damage and remaining hit points are the only gauges used as an input into a conflict resolution, then the mechanics can only resolve issues dealing with Damage and Hit Points. When designing a flexible Contest Tree you will need to consider both the inputs and also the outputs.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"></a>Last Man Standing</h3></div></div></div><p>Last Man Standing conflict system provides a generalized Contest Tree to resolve which side attains victory in battle.</p><p>The Last Man Standing is also one of the most traditional forms of generalized Contest Trees. The basic idea behind the pattern is to identify who the winner is by the simple fact of who manages to destroy the opponent. He who does is the winner. This is also one of the simplest ways to implement a Contest Tree.</p><p>It is used when there is a strong emphasis on tactical combat. Keep in mind that you are not obligated to use one pattern or the other. You can very well combine several patterns together, and you should to make it more interesting. For instance, if your game has a great emphasis on combat, but you want to also introduce some negotiation into the conflict resolution, you can certainly do so. Again, it all depends on you and your game design.</p><p>Something to keep in mind; if the only way to resolve a high-level contest is through battle, then players will focus their efforts on being the best they possibly can at winning battles. In other words, if a game only provides a single tool to resolve disputes, then you can be assured that players will become very adept and focused on using that tool.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"></a>Negotiated Contest</h3></div></div></div><p>A Negotiated Contest provides a mechanical means to resolve disputes where the set of inputs and possible outcomes is negotiated by the player and non-player characters specifically for the conflict.</p><p>Designing and developing a Negotiated Contest mechanism is pretty complex. In order for the pattern to work properly, you will need to consider all of the inputs and outputs of the negotiations. The challenge of developing such a system is not so much the actual technical implementation, but the database that you will have to create and retain based on the available selection by the player and the outcome of each input.</p><p>The implementation of the mechanics can be as simple as a few options and outcomes, and as complex as a variety of options and their eventual outcomes down the line. The important point is that you will have introduced a negotiation mechanism after a conflict has been introduced but before any action has been taken! The outcome is obviously what a win/lose is concerned with, based on the negotiation before the conflict.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note7"></a>Note</h3><p>The Negotiated Contest pattern requires that players be allowed to negotiate the effects of success and failure before the conflict is mechanically resolved.</p></div><p>Use the Negotiates Contest pattern when your design goals include one of more of the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>A desire to unambiguously decide whether the outcome of a contest means a player wins or loses his stated goals rather than whether or not his character succeeds in performing discrete actions.</p></li><li><p>A need to scale the resolution of contests to levels of granularity different than that of individual actions.</p></li><li><p>A willingness to allow players a great deal of narrative freedom in describing the results of contests, both good and bad.</p></li></ol></div><p>For computer role-playing games, the negotiated contest will have some restrictions as we cannot afford to create an AI system to be open ended. But we can design a simpler means to provide the player a sense of some control on the negotiations as part of the gameplay.</p><p>Negotiation can be a great mechanic for exchanging information with non-player characters in your role playing game. There are three parts to a Negotiation pattern:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Initiation</em></span> is the phase at which a character action is introduced into the game world</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Execution</em></span> is the phase in which the success or failure of a character action is determined</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Effect</em></span> is the phase in which the results of a character's actions are determined</p></li></ul></div><p>Here are some questions to consider when designing a Negotiation system:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>What does the winner get?</p></li><li><p>What does the loser get?</p></li><li><p>How do we know who's the winner and who's the loser?</p></li><li><p>What do we need to establish before resolution begins, and how?</p></li></ol></div></div></div>
