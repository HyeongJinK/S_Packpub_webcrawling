<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec22"></a>Character states</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>States are an important part of the character design. They will also drive the kind of actions and movement you will need to create for each state. For instance, at a minimum our character will need to have the following states implemented:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Idle</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Walking</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Running</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Jumping</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Attacking</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Die</p></li></ul></div><p>You character may have more states defined, this is something that you as the designer of the game will need to identify and eventually implement. Each one of the states identified will need to be implemented as an animation. The person creating the character models will usually also develop the animations for the character.</p><p>With the latest release of Unity 5, the <span class="strong"><strong>Mecanim Animation System</strong></span> was introduced which is used to create easy workflow and setup of animations on humanoid characters, retargeting of animation from one character to the next, previewing of the animation clips, managing complex interactions between animations with a visual tool and animating different body parts with different logic.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>You can download <span class="emphasis"><em>RawMocap Data</em></span> for Mecanim 1.1 from the asset store. The package contains several raw motion capture data files for your use. Beware, that you might have to do some adjustments on your own.</p></div><p>When creating your character models, it is a good idea to follow the proper bone structure setup for your characters. This will help make it easier controlling the states and the animations of your character as well as re-using your Animation Controller on multiple characters. This is also true if you are going to use a character from the Asset Store.</p></div>
