We also created parameters to use as a condition to change to each animation state and the transition between each clip.</p><p>Next, we created our <span class="strong"><strong>CharacterControl</strong></span> script to control our character. We also learned how to use the <code class="literal">Move()</code> function in the <code class="literal">CharacterController</code> script and how to speed up or slow down the animation clip by setting the speed of the clip. We also learned how to adjust the transition blending between each animation clip to change the state instantly. Then, we used the <code class="literal">OnAnimationMove()</code> function to set the animation state and parameters to control our animation clip.</p><p>Lastly, we created <code class="literal">CharacterCamera</code> to follow our character by using the <code class="literal">LateUpdate()</code> function to track the position of the character. </p><p>We will see a result <a id="id690" class="indexterm"></a>similar to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695589/graphics/5589OT_04_39.jpg" /></div></div>
