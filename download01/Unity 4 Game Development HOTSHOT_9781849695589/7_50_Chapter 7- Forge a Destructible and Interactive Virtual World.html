The most important feature is the game's level. So, what's the meaning of a game's level or just a level in general? First of all, a level marks a gradation in either the difficulty at that stage or the logical progression of the story of the game. It makes our game much more fun to the player. There might be a puzzle to solve, or sometimes it's just a cool graphics environment. Each level will include static and nonstatic objects. The static objects do not respond to physics <a id="id1140" class="indexterm"></a>and may include bridges, houses, and so on. On the other hand, nonstatic objects such as rocks, doors, and switches will interact with the player.</p><p>In many cases, we will see that games use interactive objects to make a level much more fun to play by adding events or triggers to the objects and making them interact with the players. For example, the player has to push the switch to open the door, or he gets blocked by a destroyed bridge on moving close to it. We can also add physics to the nonstatic objects to make them behave realistically, such as adding physics to the rocks when they are falling down to the ground.</p><p>In this project, we will learn how to create<a id="id1141" class="indexterm"></a> an interactive environment by using the <code class="literal">trigger</code> event and the <code class="literal">callback</code> function. We will create a destructible rock that will be triggered when the player gets close to it, and we will also create a destroyable wall that the player and AI can shoot at to destroy it. We will also learn how to set up the <code class="literal">ragdoll</code> object for the AI, which will add the physics interaction when the player kills it.</p></div>
