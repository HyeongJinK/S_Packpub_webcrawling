So, in this project, we will be using a full 3D character. We will take a close look at how to apply a material and shader to the model. </p><p>In Unity, there are three different types of shaders. First, surface shaders is the best option if we want our shader to be affected by lights and shadows. Next, Vertex and Fragment Shaders will be required when our shader doesn't need to interact with lighting or needs an effect that surface shaders can't handle. Finally, ShaderLab and Fixed Function Shaders use the old hardware that don't support programmable shaders (GLSL and HLSL/CG), which is mostly used for fallback from a fancy shader. Each type has its advantages. However, we will use surface shaders in this project, which is very convenient and easiest to use when we want to deal with the lighting and shadow.

<span class="strong"><strong>Computer Graphics</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CG</strong></span>) is a high-level shader language developed by NVIDIA<a id="id387" class="indexterm"></a> in close collaboration with Microsoft to programme the vertex and pixel shader. It is similar to <span class="strong"><strong>High Level Shader Language</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>High Level Shading Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HLSL</strong></span>), which is a proprietary shading language developed by Microsoft for <a id="id388" class="indexterm"></a>use with the Microsoft Direct3D API.

We can then use the Cg shading language or HLSL to write vertex and fragment shaders.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"></a>Note</h3><p>Surface shaders<a id="id389" class="indexterm"></a> in Unity is basically the repetitive code that makes it easier to write the shaders that interact with lighting than using low-level vertex/pixel shader programs (Vertex and Fragment Shaders), such as lighting calculation. However, we still need to know Cg/HLSL to write <a id="id390" class="indexterm"></a>surface shaders. For more information, refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/SL-SurfaceShaders.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/SL-SurfaceShaders.html</a>.</p></div><p>When we are writing shaders, we need to deal with the vertex and pixel shader programming. We will need to get the vertex data from our geometry, calculate the data, and pass it out to the pixel level. At the pixel level, we will calculate the color of the geometry, light, and shadow, and then we will get the result. This can be very complex and repetitive, especially when we have to deal with lighting. It can be a nightmare. Unity 3 has come up with a new style of writing the shader program that is shorter and simpler—surface shaders—which helps us to reduce the time to write the repetitive code over and over again. However, we still need to know the basics of Cg/HLSL programming, but we won't go too deep into how to create a shader from scratch or how Cg/HLSL works. We will just introduce some functions and variables that are required for our custom shader.</p></div>
