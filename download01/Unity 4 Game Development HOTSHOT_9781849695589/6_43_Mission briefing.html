The waypoint is basically a path made from many points that AI will be following from the start to the end point. This script will allow us to control the direction and area where AI can be moved. We will also create the <code class="literal">WaypointsContainer</code> script and <span class="strong"><strong>CustomEditor</strong></span> for it. This editor script will make it easy for us to add/remove and control how the AI should be moved, such as randomly moving or moving by order to each waypoint.</p><p>To make it easier for us to see each waypoint and its moving direction, we will use the <code class="literal">OnDrawGizmos()</code> function, which will allow us to see the wireframe, raycast line, icons, and the <a id="id931" class="indexterm"></a>area while we are playing or editing the game in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. This is very powerful for debugging and editing the level in the game.</p><p>Next, we will create <a id="id932" class="indexterm"></a>the AI character and its script, which will be inherited from <code class="literal">CharacterClass</code>. This class is basically the class that contains all the functions and parameters similar to the <code class="literal">CharacterControl</code> class that we have used in the <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Project 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Build a Rocket Launcher!</em></span>, with some additional methods. The AI script will be able to move the AI character to each waypoint, stop, walk, jump if it hits the wall, and run and shoot if the player is in the range.</p><p>Finally, we will add the hit-point UI bar for our character and the AI to show how much damage is caused when the enemy attacks us or when we shoot at the enemy.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec100"></a>Why is it awesome?</h3></div></div></div><p>When we complete this project, we will be able to create a simple AI behavior that is smart enough to<a id="id933" class="indexterm"></a> detect the player and respond to the player's reaction. From this project, we will begin to create smart AI for any kind of game. Most of the methods or equations in this project are very straightforward and are easy enough to use to create a simple AI and can be developed to make the AI smarter. For example, we can mix the waypoint script with the NavMesh to make our AI even more efficient.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note72"></a>Note</h3><p>However, NavMesh is superior to waypoints in certain cases, especially where there are the corners to move around. Having the waypoint implies following only a single path, while the Navmesh gives more freedom to move, thereby appearing more real. For more information on Navmesh in Unity, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navigation.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navigation.html</a>.</p></div><p>We will<a id="id934" class="indexterm"></a> also get the basic knowledge to create <span class="strong"><strong>CustomEditor</strong></span>, which will be extremely helpful when we want to design the level in our game. This is the most powerful feature in Unity, which is very useful to create a level editor for our game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec101"></a>Your Hotshot objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>We will <a id="id935" class="indexterm"></a>create the new <code class="literal">AI</code> script that is derived from the <code class="literal">CharacterClass</code> script, which has methods and parameters similar to the <code class="literal">CharacterControl</code> class that we have in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Project 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Build a Rocket Launcher!</em></span>. This script will control the AI movement and behavior by implementing the new waypoint system to limit the movable area of our enemy. Then, we will create the hit-point UI for both player and enemy, as well as the <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span> button when either one dies. The following are the steps that we will go through in this project:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the <code class="literal">Waypoint</code> and <code class="literal">WaypointsContainer</code> scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a custom editor for the <code class="literal">WaypointsContainer</code> script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the enemy movement with the AI script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a hit-point UI</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec102"></a>Mission checklist</h3></div></div></div><p>Before<a id="id936" class="indexterm"></a> we start, we will need to get the project folder and assets from Packt's website, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/support?nid=8267" target="_blank">http://www.packtpub.com/support?nid=8267</a>, which includes the package from the first project and the assets that we need to use in this project.</p><p>Navigate to the preceding URL and download the <code class="literal">Chapter6.zip</code> package and unzip it.
