Even though our custom script works really well with this character, it still has a lot of things that we can improve to make our script much more flexible. Let's do something to make our script better and much more flexible. Give the following ideas a try:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add your own character with a different animation, even if the character has more than five animation clips</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Use a different method to make the camera not follow the character when our character jumps (or basically just rotate the camera)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Change some parameters such as distance or height in the <code class="literal">CameraControl</code> script to see how the game will look</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create more action for the character such as slide or crawl and control them by using the state machine</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add the<a id="id692" class="indexterm"></a> backward walk or run by setting the negative speed for those animation clips and using the <code class="literal">_isBackward</code> property to check it</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Download the<a id="id693" class="indexterm"></a> Mecanim Locomotion Starter Kit package from Unity Asset Store (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/7673" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/7673</a>) and use the <span class="strong"><strong>Mocap</strong></span><a id="id694" class="indexterm"></a> data inside this package and retarget to our character</p></li></ul></div></div>
