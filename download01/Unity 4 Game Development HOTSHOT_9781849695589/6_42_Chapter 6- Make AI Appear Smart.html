The game AI is very different from the traditional AI in many ways because traditional AI tries to make it as close to the human brain as possible. On the other hand, the game AI cares more about the player experience. So, the workarounds and cheats are acceptable. In many cases, we will see the computer abilities have toned down to give the human players a sense of fairness. For example, we don't want to have the enemy kill players all the time without a chance to fight back.</p><p>Most games need AI for the enemy to be able to react to the player. The AI will run towards and attack the player, or it will jump or walk avoiding the obstacles, and so on. However, we have to be careful with the balance between making the AI smart and the performance speed to get the best moves. This is why the game AI and traditional AI are different. To get the best moves means more calculation, so it might cause a problem with performance slowing down.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note67"></a>Note</h3><p>For<a id="id921" class="indexterm"></a> more details on the comparison between the game AI and traditional AI, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ai-blog.net/archives/000183.html" target="_blank">http://www.ai-blog.net/archives/000183.html</a>.</p></div><p>We can <a id="id922" class="indexterm"></a>use <span class="strong"><strong>A* algorithm</strong></span> for the pathfinder or <span class="strong"><strong>Minimax algorithm</strong></span> to<a id="id923" class="indexterm"></a> calculate the best move, but these algorithms are very complex for a beginner.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note68"></a>Note</h3><p>A* algorithm or A Star algorithm is a computer algorithm that is widely used in path finding and graph traversal nodes. Noted for its performance and accuracy, it enjoys widespread use. Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael first described the algorithm in 1968. It is an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm.</p><p>The reference<a id="id924" class="indexterm"></a> is taken from <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm</a>.</p><p>The following links provide some useful information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>Minimax algorithm<a id="id925" class="indexterm"></a> is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss while maximizing the potential gain. Alternatively, it can be thought of as maximizing the minimum gain (maximin). Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision making in the presence of uncertainty.</p><p>The <a id="id926" class="indexterm"></a>reference is taken from <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax</a>.</p><p>The following links provide some useful information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

It might not make our AI as smart as using those algorithms, but we will get the basic idea of how to create smart AI.</p><p>After the release of Unity 3.5, there is a new feature for AI called <span class="strong"><strong>NavMesh</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Navigation Mesh</strong></span>), which <a id="id927" class="indexterm"></a>is a pathfinder system that calculates the walkable area by using the original mesh to create the new one, which is used to calculate the possible path for the AI. Even though the NavMesh feature is available in the free version <a id="id928" class="indexterm"></a>after Unity 4.2, there is still the <span class="strong"><strong>Off Mesh Links</strong></span> feature. This feature is used to check for the character when it isn't in the mesh area, such as when the character is jumping.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note71"></a>Note</h3><p>For more<a id="id929" class="indexterm"></a> information, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/OffMeshLinks.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/OffMeshLinks.html</a>.</p><p>For a<a id="id930" class="indexterm"></a> quick start tutorial on how to set up NavMesh, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD11AzSQ0Ao" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD11AzSQ0Ao</a>.</p></div><p>In this chapter, we will reuse the scripts and assets from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Project 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Build a Rocket Launcher!</em></span>, to implement the AI enemy. We will be creating an enemy by implementing the simple AI. However, this AI would be smart enough to detect when to jump, run, walk, stop, or shoot at the player by creating the waypoint for the enemy to walk to each point, run towards the player and then shoot when the player gets closer, and jump when it detects the wall.</p></div>
