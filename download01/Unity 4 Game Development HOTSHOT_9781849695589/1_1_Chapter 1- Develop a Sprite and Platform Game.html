Of course, Mario was first introduced in the eighties, followed by Mega Man and Sonic, but even now the new generation loves these games. Yes, we are talking about the old style 2D platform games, which are still quite popular today, especially among indie game developers.</p><p>In this book, we will start the first project with a 2D platform game because there are some basic tricks for a 2D platform game that will help you—those who haven't got into the 3D world yet—to understand more before jumping into the 3D world for the later projects.</p><p>There is a huge improvement on Unity after <a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a>the release of <span class="strong"><strong>4.3</strong></span>. The best feature for most game developers is the 2D feature in Unity, which will help us to speed up the 2D game development time. In this project, we will be using a similar concept to the Unity's 2D Platformer project in the assets store. This includes the new <span class="strong"><strong>sprite</strong></span> object<a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a> and the new 2D physics engine that integrated Box2D (the 2D physics game engine that is used in many games such as Angry Birds).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>We can also download the Unity 2D project<a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a> from the Unity Asset Store: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/11228" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/11228</a>
