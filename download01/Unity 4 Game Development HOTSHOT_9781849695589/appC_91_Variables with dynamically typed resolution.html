This only occurs if you don't assign a value or specify a type while declaring the variable:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>// JavaScript user:</strong></span> The type specification is not necessary.
var playerLife : int;       //statically typed (because 
                                type specified)
var playerLife = 2;      //statically typed (because 
                                type is inferred from value 
                                assigned)
var playerLife;        //dynamically typed (because 
                                   neither a type or value is  
                                   specified)</pre></div><p>The dynamically typed variables will cause slower performance, and you can run into casting problems. You can use <code class="literal">#pragma strict</code> by including this at the top of a script to tell Unity to disable the dynamic typing in the script and report compile errors when there is a dynamic type in the script.</p><p>On the other hand, <code class="literal">var</code> in C# means that the type of variable being declared on the right-hand side of the code will be inferred by the compiler, which will be similar to a static type declaration. However, <code class="literal">var</code> cannot be used for the dynamic type:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>// C# user:</strong></span>

var playerLife = 2;      //This statement is equivalent 
int playerLife = 2;      //to this statement</pre></div></div>
