When we talk about traditional role-playing games, we will probably be thinking about the development of the character, such as the attributes, skills, powers, levels, or experiences. When we are playing an RPG, we typically have to open the menu or UI to adjust and manage our main character, such as increase the character attribute, change the weapon, or choose skills. The menu is very important in an RPG. So, in this project, we will create the menu window for a simple RPG-like game using a <code class="literal">GUI</code> class in Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>From Unity 4.6, there will be the new GUI system for a Unity user, which is faster in performance, easier to use, and has many more features such as 3D canvas, dynamic GUI, and event system. This project won't go over the new GUI system because the book is based on Unity 4.3. However, the project will show you how to use the old GUI system or the <span class="strong"><strong>Immediate Mode GUI</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IMGUI</strong></span>)<a id="id200" class="indexterm"></a> system. The good thing to know is that the custom editor in Unity is based on the IMGUI system, which will help you to get the basic understanding to create the custom editor. More <a id="id201" class="indexterm"></a>details on the new GUI system (uGUI) can be found at the following links:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
