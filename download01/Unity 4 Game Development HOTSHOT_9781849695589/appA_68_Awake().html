<code class="literal">Awake</code> is<a id="id1282" class="indexterm"></a> used to initialize any variable or a<a id="id1283" class="indexterm"></a> game state before the game starts. It is called only once during the lifetime of the script instance. It is also called after all the objects are initialized, so you can safely speak to other objects or query them using, for example, <code class="literal">GameObject.FindWithTag</code>. Each <code class="literal">Awake()</code> function of a GameObject is called in a random order between objects. As a result of this, you should use <code class="literal">Awake()</code> to set up references between scripts and use <code class="literal">Start()</code> to pass any information back and forth. <code class="literal">Awake()</code> is always called before any <code class="literal">Start()</code> function. This allows you to order the initialization of scripts.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip41"></a>Tip</h3><p>For C# and Boo users, use <code class="literal">Awake()</code> instead of the constructor for initialization, as the serialized state of the component is undefined at construction time. <code class="literal">Awake()</code> is called once, just like the constructor.</p><p>
<code class="literal">Awake()</code> cannot be a coroutine (we will cover more about coroutines in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="appB">Appendix B</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Coroutines and Yield</em></span>).</p></div><p>An <a id="id1284" class="indexterm"></a>example of <code class="literal">Awake()</code> is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>// JavaScript user:</strong></span>

private var myTarget : GameObject;
function Awake() {
    myTarget = GameObject.FindWithTag("Target");
}


<span class="strong"><strong>// C# user:</strong></span>

GameObject myTarget;
void Awake() {
    myTarget = GameObject.FindWithTag("Target");
}</pre></div></div>
