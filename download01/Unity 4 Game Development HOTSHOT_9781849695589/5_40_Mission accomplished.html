We also learned how to set up the camera for a third-person view while the character is aiming, created new <code class="literal">AnimatorController</code> to control each action, created a rocket launcher, created the <code class="literal">rocket</code> prefab, and used the Shuriken Particle system to create the smoke from the launcher barrel, smoke trial from the rocket, and the explosion.</p><p>Next, we also<a id="id916" class="indexterm"></a> learned how to use the <code class="literal">Instantiate()</code> function to clone the game object and display it in the scene. We used <code class="literal">Invoke()</code> to <a id="id917" class="indexterm"></a>call the function after the time that we assigned. Lastly, we created a UI to track the number of rockets left by using <span class="strong"><strong>GUITexture</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>GUIText</strong></span>.</p><p>Let's take a look at the following screenshot to see what we have done so far:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695589/graphics/5589OT_05_38.jpg" /></div><p>The <a id="id918" class="indexterm"></a>preceding screenshot shows the camera view of the character.
