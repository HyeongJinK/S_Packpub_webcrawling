The following screenshot demonstrates this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695589/graphics/5589_01_01.jpg" /></div><p>We will use a 2D character sprite sheet (which is the set of many small images in a large image, as shown in the previous figure), and the new 2D feature in Unity to create our 2D character. The new <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>2D feature in Unity helps us to manage the sprite sheet and set up the animation for each character's movement without writing any script.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>There are many tools that can help you to create a sprite sheet, such as <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>TexturePacker. It basically creates an image file with the data that contains all the information such as name of the sprite, position, and sprite area. In this process, we will have two files—the image file (<code class="literal">.jpeg</code> or <code class="literal">.png</code>) and datafile (<code class="literal">.txt</code> or <code class="literal">.xml</code>)— which might be a bit confusing for beginners. So, Unity 4.3 solved this problem by including the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Import Setting</strong></span>, which we can just use to import the asset and set the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span>, and then set the mode to either <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span> (the image that contains many sprites packed in one file) or <span class="strong"><strong>Single</strong></span> sprite.</p><p>For more information about <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>TexturePacker and a <a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a>sprite sheet, visit the following URL: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" target="_blank">http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.codeandweb.com/what-is-a-sprite-sheet" target="_blank">http://www.codeandweb.com/what-is-a-sprite-sheet</a>.
</p></div><p>The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with the new 2D feature and language syntax in Unity, which is very important when creating a playable game.</p><p>We will begin by setting up the sprite for our character, game level, and item in the game. Next, we will create our character sprite object, create the animator controller, and set up each animation clip for idle, walk, jump, and fall. We will also create the script, which will control the character to show the correct animation (idle, walking, and jumping). This script will allow us to control the character action by pressing the arrow key to move and space bar to jump. Also, we will learn how to set up the custom input manager.</p><p>Next, we will create the level and platform using the sprite object with <code class="literal">BoxCollider2D</code> and <code class="literal">PolygonCollider2D</code> attached, which will collide with the character that has <code class="literal">Rigidbody2D</code> attached to make the movement realistic.</p><p>To end the game, we will <a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>create a trigger event by having a door and key game object. The player needs to collect the key to be able to open the door and end the game. We will also add sound to make our game lively, but we are not finishing it yet. The game needs to be replayable. Lastly, we will add a <span class="strong"><strong>Replay</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Play again</strong></span> button to replay our game by using <code class="literal">Destroy</code> and <code class="literal">Instantiate</code> to reset our character's position and key item.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"></a>Why is it awesome?</h3></div></div></div><p>When we are <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>done with this project, we will get a good understanding of how to <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>create a sprite and 2D platform game by using the new 2D feature in the Unity engine. Also, we will be able to create our own 2D platform style game such as Sonic, Mario, and Mega Man, and reuse some of our techniques, scripts, and concepts to create a 3D game at a later stage.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"></a>Your Hotshot objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>This project will be split into <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>five tasks. As we are not creating any enemies in our game, we don't have to deal with any complex scripting. It will be a simple step-by-step process from beginning to end. The following is the outline of the tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up a 2D level and collider</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a 2D character and animation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Controlling the character with the <code class="literal">PlayerController_2D</code> classes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a key, door, and replay button</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"></a>Mission checklist</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we start, we <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>will need to get the latest<a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a> Unity version ( <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/unity/download/</a>) that includes <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>, which we will use for our scripting editor. We will also need a few graphics for our character, key, and door as well as a collection of sound FX. These can be downloaded as ZIP files from Packt's website: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/support?nid=8267" target="_blank">http://www.packtpub.com/support?nid=8267</a>. </p><p>Browse the preceding<a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a> URL and download the <code class="literal">Chapter1.zip</code> package and unzip it. Inside the <code class="literal">Chapter1</code> folder, there are two unity packages: <code class="literal">Chapter1Package.unitypackage</code> (we will use this package for this project) and <code class="literal">Chapter1Package_Completed.unitypackage</code> (this is the completed project package that includes both C# and Unity JavaScript). </p></div></div>
