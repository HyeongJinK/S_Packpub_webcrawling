We can make it more interesting with something like the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create your own object in any 3D software instead of the cube to make it much more <a id="id1206" class="indexterm"></a>realistic and attach the <code class="literal">Rocks</code> script to it and see how it works</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add some script that will make the rock damage the player and AIs when they get hit while the rock is falling down</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add the smoke particle to the rocks when they are falling down</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make a ragdoll match the last AI animation post by creating a ragdoll with the <code class="literal">AI</code> game object and using the <span class="strong"><strong>is Kinematic</strong></span> method to enable or disable ragdoll physics instead of replacing the new object</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a random rock that will fall every time the player walks by the lake</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a trigger area such as door or switch that can trigger multiple events at the same time by using the <code class="literal">delegate</code> and <code class="literal">event</code> functions</p></li></ul></div></div>
