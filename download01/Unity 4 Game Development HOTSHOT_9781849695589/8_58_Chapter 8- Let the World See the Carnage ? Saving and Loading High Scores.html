Many a times, a game will have a list of several high scores called the <a id="id1207" class="indexterm"></a>high score table, which shows a list of scores that each player gets when playing the game. During the era of arcade games or some current puzzle games that involve endless cycles of continuous gameplay, scores had a much greater relevance in giving the player the replayable value and the feeling of achievement.</p><p>Why do we need to save the high score? The advantage of the high score is to keep a record of the players and how well they progress each time they play the game. It also creates a challenge for the players to beat their record and keep playing the game again. There are some games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Journey</em></span> that don't need the high scores. However, for most online games, the high score is very important to let the players see their progress and compare it with that of their friends or other players.</p><p>We can save the high scores on the <a id="id1208" class="indexterm"></a>player's local machine or use the database and keep it on the web server. In most case, we will use the database server to keep track of the high-score table, which is more secure. In this project, we will show you how to save the high score on the local machine using the <span class="strong"><strong>PlayerPref</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>System.Serializable</strong></span> techniques. Then, we will also save and load the high score from the server database using <span class="strong"><strong>WWWFrom</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>XML</strong></span>, and so on.</p></div>
