We also used the serialization technique to save the list of users to the bytes array, convert it<a id="id1279" class="indexterm"></a> to the string, and then use <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> to save it to the local machine. Then, we created the script to parse the XML string format to the value.</p><p>Finally, I would like to thank all of you for reading this book. I hope that you got some useful information or some new techniques from this book. Thank you very much!</p></div>
