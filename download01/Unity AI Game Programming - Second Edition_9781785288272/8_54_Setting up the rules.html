<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec53"></a>Setting up the rules</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Our "game" is <a id="id319" class="indexterm"></a>quite simple. While the actual game logic, such as health, damage, and win conditions, are left completely up to you, our example focuses on setting you up to implement your own tank-defense game.</p><p>When deciding on what kind of logic and behavior you'll need from your agent, it's important to have the rules of the game fleshed out beyond a simple idea. Of course, as you implement different features, those rules can change, but having a set of concepts nailed down early on will help you pick the best tools for the job.</p><p>It's a bit of a twist on the traditional tower-defense genre. You don't build towers to stop an oncoming enemy; you rather use your abilities to help your tank get through a gauntlet of towers. As your tank traverses the maze, towers along the path will attempt to destroy your tank by shooting explosive projectiles at it. To help your tank get to the other side, you can use two abilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Boost</strong></span>: This ability doubles up your tank's movement speed for a short period of time. This is great for getting away from a projectile in a bind.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shield</strong></span>: This creates a shield around your tank for a short period of time to block oncoming projectiles.</p></li></ul></div><p>For our example, we'll implement the towers using a finite state machine since they have a limited number of states and don't require the extra complexity of a behavior tree. The towers will also need to be <a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a>able to be aware of their surroundings, or more specifically, whether the tank is nearby so that they can shoot at it, so we'll use a sphere trigger to model the towers' field of vision and sensing. The tank needs to be able to navigate the environment on its own, so we use a NavMesh and <code class="literal">NavMeshAgent</code> to achieve this.</p></div>
