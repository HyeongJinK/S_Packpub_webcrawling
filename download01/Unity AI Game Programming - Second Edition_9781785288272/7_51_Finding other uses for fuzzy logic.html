We saw how a series of fuzzy logic controllers can easily fit into a behavior tree structure, and it's not terribly difficult to imagine how it can be used with an FSM.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec63"></a>Merging with other concepts</h3></div></div></div><p>Sensory <a id="id316" class="indexterm"></a>systems also tend to make use of fuzzy logic. While seeing something can be a binary condition, in low-light or low-contrast environments, we can suddenly see how fuzzy the condition can become. You've probably experienced it at night—seeing an odd shape, dark in the distance, in the shadows, thinking "is that a cat?" which then turns out to be a trash bag, some other animal, or perhaps even your imagination. The same can be applied to sounds and smells.</p><p>When it comes to pathfinding, we run into the cost of traversing certain areas of a grid, which, a fuzzy logic controller can easily help fuzzify and make more interesting.</p><p>Should Bob cross the bridge and fight his way through the guards or risk crossing the river and fighting the current? Well, if he's a good swimmer and a poor fighter, the choice is clear, right?</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec64"></a>Creating a truly unique experience</h3></div></div></div><p>Our agents can use <a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a>fuzzy logic to mimic personalities. Some agents may be more "brave" than others. Suddenly, their personal characteristics—how fast they are, how far they can run, their size, and so on, can be leveraged to arrive at the decisions that are unique to that agent.</p><p>Personalities can be applied to enemies, allies, friends, NPCs, or even to the rules of the game. The game can take in crisp data from the player's progress, style of play, or level of progression, and dynamically adjust the difficulty to provide a more unique and personalized challenge.</p><p>Fuzzy logic can even <a id="id318" class="indexterm"></a>be used to dole out the technical game rules, such as number of players in a given multiplayer lobby, the type of data to display to the player, and even how players are matched against other players. Taking the player's statistics and plugging those into a matchmaking system can help keep the player engaged by pitting him against the players that either match his style of play in a cooperative environment or players of similar skill level in a competitive environment.</p></div></div>
