The sensory system is just part of the decision-making system of the whole AI system. We can use the sensory system in combination with a behavior system to execute certain behaviors for certain senses. For example, we can use an FSM to change to Chase and Attack states from the Patrol state once we have detected that there's an enemy within the line of sight. We'll also cover how to apply behavior tree systems in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Trees</em></span>.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll look at how to implement flocking behaviors in Unity3D as well as the Craig Reynold's flocking algorithm.</p></div>
