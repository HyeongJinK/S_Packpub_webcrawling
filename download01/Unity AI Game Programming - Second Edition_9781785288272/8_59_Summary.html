In this chapter, we took a few of the concepts covered in the book and applied them to create a small tank-defense game. We built upon the concept of finite state machines, which we originally covered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finite State Machines and You</em></span>, and created an artificial intelligence to drive our enemy towers' behavior. We then enhanced the behavior by combining it with sensing and perception, and finally, we implemented navigation via Unity's NavMesh feature to help our tank AI navigate through our maze-like level, through a gauntlet of autonomous AI towers with one thing on their simple AI mindsâ€”destroy!</p></div>
