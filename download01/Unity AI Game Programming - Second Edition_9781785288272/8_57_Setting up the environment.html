The maze is set up in a way so that towers are spread out fairly reasonably and that the tank has plenty of space to maneuver around easily. The following screenshot shows the general layout of the maze:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_08_09.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The gauntlet our tank must run through</p></div></div><p>As you can see, there are seven towers spread out through the maze and a few twists and turn for our tank to break line of sight. In order to avoid having our tank graze the walls, we adjust the settings in the navigation window to our liking. By default, the example scene has the agent radius set to 1.46 and the step height to 1.6. There are no hard rules for how we arrived at these numbers; it is just trial and error.</p><p>After baking the <a id="id344" class="indexterm"></a>NavMesh, we'll end up with something similar to what's shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_08_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The scene after we've baked our NavMesh</p></div></div><p>Feel free to rearrange the walls and towers to your liking. Just remember that any blocking objects you add to the scene must be marked as static, and you have to rebake the navigation for the scene after you've set everything up just the way you like it.</p></div>
