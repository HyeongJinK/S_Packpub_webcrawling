We also learned the different scenarios where some nodes would be more helpful than others. After looking at some off-the-shelf solutions available on the Unity asset store, we applied this knowledge by implementing our own basic behavior tree framework in C# and explored the inner workings. With the knowledge and the tools out of the way, we created a sample behavior tree using our framework to test the concepts learned throughout the chapter. This knowledge prepares us to harness the power of behavior trees in games and take our AI implementations to the next level.</p><p>In the next chapter, <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Fuzzy Logic to Make Your AI Seem Alive</em></span>, we'll look at new ways to add complexity and functionality to the concepts we've learned in this chapter, modifying behavior trees, and FSMs, which we covered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finite State Machines and You</em></span>, via the concept of fuzzy logic.</p></div>
