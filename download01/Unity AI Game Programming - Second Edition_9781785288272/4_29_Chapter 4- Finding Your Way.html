It's important to note that the specific behavior implemented in this chapter is meant to be used for behaviors such as crowd simulation, where the main objective of each agent entity is just to avoid the other agents and reach the target. There's no consideration on what would be the most efficient and shortest path. We'll learn about the A* Pathfinding algorithm in the next section.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Path following and steering</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A custom A* Pathfinding implementation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity's built-in NavMesh</p></li></ul></div></div>
