As simple as it sounds, these concepts describe a group of objects, or boids, as they are called in artificial intelligence lingo, moving together as a group. The flocking algorithm gets its name from the behavior birds exhibit in nature, where a group of birds follow one another toward a common destination, keeping a mostly fixed distance from each other. The emphasis here is on the group. We've explored how singular agents can move and make decisions on their own, but flocks are a relatively computationally efficient way of simulating large groups of agents moving in unison while modeling unique movement in each boid that doesn't rely on randomness or predefined paths.</p><p>We'll implement two variations of flocking in this chapter. The first one will be based on a sample flocking behavior found in a demo project called Tropical Paradise Island. This demo came with <a id="id177" class="indexterm"></a>Unity in Version 2.0, but has been removed since Unity 3.0. For our <a id="id178" class="indexterm"></a>first example, we'll salvage this code and adapt it to our Unity 5 <a id="id179" class="indexterm"></a>project. The second variation will be based on Craig Reynold's flocking algorithm. Along the way, you'll notice some differences and <a id="id180" class="indexterm"></a>similarities, but there are three basic concepts that define how a flock works, and these concepts have been around since the algorithm's introduction in the 80s:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Separation</strong></span>: This <a id="id181" class="indexterm"></a>means to maintain a distance with other neighbors in the flock to avoid collision. The following diagram illustrates this concept:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>Here, the middle boid is shown moving in a direction away from the rest of the boids, without changing its heading</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: This <a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a>means to move in the same direction as the flock, and with the same velocity. The following figure illustrates this concept:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_05_02.jpg" /></div><p>Here, the boid in the middle is shown changing its heading toward the arrow to match the heading of the boids around it</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cohesion</strong></span>: This <a id="id183" class="indexterm"></a>means to maintain a minimum distance with the flock's center. The following figure illustrates this concept:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_05_03.jpg" /></div><p>Here, the boid <a id="id184" class="indexterm"></a>to the right of the rest moves in the direction of the arrow to be within the minimum distance to its nearest group of boids</p></li></ul></div></div>
