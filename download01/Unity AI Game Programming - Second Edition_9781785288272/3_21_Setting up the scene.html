We need to get our scene ready with environment objects, our agents, and some other items to help us see what the code is doing:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Let's create a few walls to block the line of sight from our AI character to the enemy. These will be short but wide cubes grouped under an empty game object called <code class="literal">Obstacles</code>.</p></li><li><p>Add a plane to be used as a floor.</p></li><li><p>Then, we add a directional light so that we can see what is going on in our scene.</p></li></ol></div><p>We will be going over this next part in detail throughout the chapter, but basically, we will use a simple tank model for our player, and a simple cube for our AI character. We will also have a <code class="literal">Target</code> object to show us where the tank will move to in our scene. Our scene hierarchy will look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_03_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The hierarchy</p></div></div><p>Now we will position the tank, AI character, and walls randomly in our scene. Increase the size of the plane to something that looks good. Fortunately, in this demo, our objects float, so nothing will fall off the plane. Also, be sure to adjust the camera so that we can <a id="id88" class="indexterm"></a>have a clear view of the following scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_03_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Where our tank and player will wander in</p></div></div><p>Now that we have the basics set up, we'll look at how to implement the tank, AI character, and aspects for our player character.</p></div>
