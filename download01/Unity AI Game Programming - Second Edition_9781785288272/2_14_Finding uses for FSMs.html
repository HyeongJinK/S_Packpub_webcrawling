In fact, the new system in Unity 5 that we'll be using was first used in the Mecanim animation system.</p><p>We can categorize many things into states in our daily lives. The most effective patterns in programming are those that mimic the simplicity of real-life designs, and FSMs are no different. Take a look around and you'll most likely notice a number of things in one of any number of possible states. For example, is there a light bulb nearby? A light bulb can be in one of two states: on or off. Let's go back to grade school for a <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>moment and think about the time when we were learning about the different states a matter can be in. Water, for example, can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Just like in the FSM pattern in programming, where variables can trigger a state change, water's transition from one state to another is caused by heat.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/4204_02_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The three distinct states of water</p></div></div><p>Though there are no hard rules beyond these of our own implementation in programming design patterns, it is a characteristic of FSMs to be in one and only one state at a time. With that said, transitions allow for a "hand-off" of sorts between two states, just like ice slowly melts into water. Additionally, an agent can have multiple FSMs, driving any number of behaviors, and states can even contain state machines of their own. Think Christopher Nolan's <span class="emphasis"><em>Inception</em></span>, but with state machines instead of dreams.</p></div>
