Perhaps more so than other concepts in this book, fuzzy logic is a very math-heavy topic. Most of the information can be represented purely in mathematical functions. For the sake of teaching the important concepts as they apply to Unity, most of the math has been simplified and implemented using the Unity's built-in features. Of course, if you are the type who loves math, this is a somewhat deep topic in that regard, so feel free to take the concepts covered in this book and run with them! In this chapter, we'll learn:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What fuzzy logic is</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Where fuzzy logic is used</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to implement fuzzy logic controllers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What the other creative uses for fuzzy logic concepts are</p></li></ul></div></div>
