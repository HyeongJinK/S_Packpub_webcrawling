We started with a basic waypoint-based system, then learned how to implement our own simple A* Pathfinding system, and finally moved onto Unity's built-in navigation system. While many would opt to go with the simplicity of Unity's NavMesh system, others may find the granular control of a custom A* implementation more appealing. What is most important, however, is understanding when and how to use these different systems.</p><p>Furthermore, without even realizing it, we saw how these systems can integrate with other concepts we learned earlier in the book.</p><p>In the next chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>Flocks and Crowds</em></span>, we'll expand on these concepts and learn how we can simulate entire groups of agents moving in unison in a believable and performant fashion.</p></div>
