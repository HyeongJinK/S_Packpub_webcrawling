In the previous chapters, we looked at transition rules as true or false or 0 or 1 values. Is something visible? Is it at least a certain distance away? Even in instances where multiple values were being evaluated, all of the values had exactly two outcomes thus, they are binary. In contrast, fuzzy values represent a much richer range of possibilities, where each value is represented as a float rather than an integer. We stop looking at values as 0 or 1, and we start looking at them as 0 to 1.</p><p>A common example used to describe fuzzy logic is temperature. Fuzzy logic allows us to make decisions based on non-specific data. I can step outside on a sunny California summer day and ascertain that it is warm, without knowing the temperature precisely. Conversely, if I were to find myself in Alaska during the winter, I would know that it is cold, again, without knowing the exact temperature. These concepts of cold, cool, warm, and hot are fuzzy ones. There is a good amount of ambiguity as to at what point we go from warm to hot. Fuzzy logic allows us to model these concepts as sets and determine their validity or truth by using a set of rules.</p><p>When making decisions, people, as it is common to say, has some gray area. That is to say, it's not always black and white. The same concept applies to agents that rely on fuzzy logic. Say you hadn't eaten in a few hours, and you were starting to feel a little hungry. At which point were you hungry enough to go grab a snack? You could look at the time right after a meal as 0, and 1 would be the point where you approached starvation. The <a id="id290" class="indexterm"></a>following figure illustrates this point:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785288272/graphics/B04204_07_01.jpg" /></div><p>When making decisions, there are many factors that determine the choice. This leads into another aspect of fuzzy logic controllers—they can take into account as much data as necessary. Let's continue to look at our "should I eat?" example. We've only considered one value for making that decision, which is the time since the last time you ate, however, there are other factors that can affect this decision, such as, how much energy you're expending and how lazy you are at that particular moment. Or am I the only one to use that as a deciding factor? Either way, you can see how multiple input values can affect the output, which we can think of as the "likeliness to have another meal".</p><p>Fuzzy logic systems can be very flexible due to their generic nature. You provide input, the fuzzy logic provides an output. What that output means to your game is entirely up to you. We've primarily looked at how the inputs would affect a decision, which, in reality, is taking the output and using it in a way the computer, our agent, can understand. However, the output can also be used to determine how much of something to do, or how fast something happens, or for how long something happens. For example, imagine your agent is a car in a sci-fi racing game that has a "nitro-boost" ability that lets it expend a resource to go faster. Our 0 to 1 value can represent a normalized amount of time for it to use that boost or perhaps <a id="id291" class="indexterm"></a>a normalized amount of fuel to use.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec58"></a>Picking fuzzy systems over binary systems</h3></div></div></div><p>As with the <a id="id292" class="indexterm"></a>previous systems we covered in this book, and with most things in game programming, we must evaluate the requirements of our game and the technology and hardware limitations when deciding on the best way to tackle a problem.</p><p>As you might imagine, there is a performance cost associated with going from a simple yes/no system to a more nuanced fuzzy logic one, which is one of the reasons we may opt out of using it. Of course, being a more complex system doesn't necessarily always mean it's a better one. There will be times when you just want the simplicity and predictability of a binary system because it may fit your game better.</p><p>While there is some truth to the old adage "the simpler, the better", one should also take into account the saying "everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler". Though the quote is largely attributed to Albert Einstein, the father of relativity, it's not entirely clear who said it. The important thing to consider is the meaning of the quote itself. You should make your AI as simple as your game needs it to be, but not simpler. Pac-Man's AI works perfectly for the game—it's just simple enough. However, rules say that simple would simply be out of place in a modern shooter or strategy game.</p><p>Take the knowledge and examples from this book and find what works best for you.</p></div></div>
