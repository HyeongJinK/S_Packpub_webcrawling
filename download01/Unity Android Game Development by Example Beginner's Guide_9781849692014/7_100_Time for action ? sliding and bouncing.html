Right-click inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physic Material</strong></span>. Create two physic materials and name one <code class="literal">Glass</code> and the other <code class="literal">Rubber</code>.</p></li><li><p>Select one of them and take a look at it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. Right now, we are only concerned with the first three values. The others are used for more complex situations.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic Friction</strong></span>: This property is the amount of friction used when the object is moving. A value of zero is no friction, such as ice, and a value of one is a lot of friction, such as rubber.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Static Friction</strong></span>: This property functions the same as <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic Friction</strong></span>, the difference being that it is used when the object is not moving.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bounciness</strong></span>: This property is how much of an object's energy is reflected when it hits something or is hit by something. Zero means none of the energy is reflected, while a value of one will reflect all of it.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>For the <code class="literal">Glass</code> material, set the two friction values to <code class="literal">0.1</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bounciness</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code>. For the <code class="literal">Rubber</code> material, set the two friction values to <code class="literal">1</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bounciness</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.8</code>.</p></li><li><p>Next, select your <code class="literal">Plank_Glass</code> prefab and take a look at its <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> component. To apply your new physics materials, simply drag-and-drop one from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> slot. Do the same for your <code class="literal">Plank_Rubber</code> prefab and, any time an object hits one of them, the materials will be used to control their interaction.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec100"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We created a pair of physics materials. They control how two colliders interact when they run into each other. Using them, we are given control over the amount of friction and bounciness that is possessed by any collider.</p></div></div>
