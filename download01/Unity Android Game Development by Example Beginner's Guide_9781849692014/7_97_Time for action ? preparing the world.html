Naming it <code class="literal">Ch7_AngryBirds</code> will work well. Be sure to change the target platform to <span class="strong"><strong>Android</strong></span> and set the <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span> to an appropriate value.</p></li><li><p>Next, import the starting assets for this chapter and create some folders to keep everything organized.</p></li><li><p>In Unity, it is very easy to turn a game from 3D to 2D. Simply select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object that is by default present in every new scene, find the <span class="strong"><strong>Projection</strong></span> value, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> from the drop-down list.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip25"></a>Tip</h3><p>Every camera has two options for how to render the game. <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> renders everything utilizing the distance from the camera, imitating the real world; objects that are farther away from the camera are drawn smaller than objects that are closer. <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> renders everything without this consideration; objects are not scaled based on their distance from the camera.</p></div></li><li><p>Initially, the amount of the scene that the camera views is far too large. To change this, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">5</code>. This reduces the amount of space the camera will render. This value will keep us focused on the action as the game is played.</p></li><li><p>To make the camera properly usable, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to <code class="literal">10</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> axis, <code class="literal">3</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> axis, and <code class="literal">0</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> axis. Also, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> axis to <code class="literal">-90</code>. Everything is going to be positioned along the z axis, so our camera needs to be set to watch the axis and be far away enough so that it is not in the action.</p></li><li><p>Next, we are going to need a ground. So, go to the menu bar of Unity and click on <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span>, and finally, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>. This will suit well enough as a simple ground.</p></li><li><p>To make it look a little like a ground, create a green material and apply it to the <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>The ground cube needs to be large enough to cover the whole of our field of play. To do this, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to <code class="literal">5</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> axis, <code class="literal">10</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> axis, and <code class="literal">100</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> axis. Also, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> axes, and <code class="literal">30</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> axis. Since nothing will be moving along the x axis, the ground only needs to be large enough for the other objects that will be in our scene to land on. It does, however, need to be wide and tall enough to keep the camera from seeing the edges.</p></li><li><p>Right now, the <a id="id457" class="indexterm"></a>ground looks rather dark due to the lack of light. From the menu bar of Unity, click on <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span>, and lastly click on <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> to add some brightness to the scene. It should be positioned to shine on the side of the cube that faces the camera.</p></li><li><p>Next, we need to keep all of the objects that will be flying around the scene from straying too far and causing problems. To do this, we need to create some trigger volumes. The simplest way to do this is to create three more cubes. Position one at each end of the ground object and the last cube at about 50 units above. Then, scale them to form a box with the ground. Each should be no thicker than a single unit, and they need to be five units deep, the same as the ground. Next, remove their <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Filter</strong></span> components. This removes the visible box, while leaving the collider volume. To change them to trigger volumes, check the <span class="strong"><strong>Is Trigger</strong></span> checkbox on each <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> component.</p></li><li><p>To make the volumes actually keep objects from straying too far, we need to create a new script. Create it and name it <code class="literal">GoneTooFar</code>.</p></li><li><p>This script has a single, short function, <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter</code>.<a id="id458" class="indexterm"></a> We use it to destroy any object that might enter the volume. This function is used by Unity's physics system to detect when an object has entered a trigger volume. We will go into more detail later but, for now, know that one of the two objects, either the volume or the object entering it, needs a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component. In our case, everything we might want to remove when they enter the trigger will have a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
  Destroy(other.gameObject);
}</pre></div></li><li><p>Finally, return to Unity and add the script to the three trigger-volume objects.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_07_01.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec95"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We did the initial setup for <a id="id459" class="indexterm"></a>our 2D game. By changing our camera view to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>, the view switches from a 3D game to a 2D one. We also created a ground and some trigger volumes for our scene. Together, these will keep our birds and anything else from straying too far.</p></div></div>
