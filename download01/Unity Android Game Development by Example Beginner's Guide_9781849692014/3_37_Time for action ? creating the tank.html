<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec41"></a>Time for action â€“ creating the tank</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>At this point, the creation of <a id="id216" class="indexterm"></a>our tank will primarily consist of the creation and arrangement of the tank's components.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Start by dragging the tank from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window. You will notice that the name of the tank appears in blue color in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window. This is because it is a prefab instance. Any model in your project largely acts like a prefab. But, we want our tank to do more than just sit there. So, being a prefab of a static mesh is not helpful. Therefore, select your tank in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window and we will start making it useful by removing the <code class="literal">Animator</code> component. To do this, select the gear to the right of the <code class="literal">Animator</code> component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. From the new drop-down list, select <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Component</strong></span> and it will be removed.</p></li><li><p>If you are using the tank provided by default, selecting the different parts of it will reveal that all the pivot points are at the base. This will not be useful for making our turret and cannon pivot properly. The easiest way to solve this is by adding new empty <code class="literal">GameObject</code> to act as pivot points.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"></a>Tip</h3><p>Any object in the scene is a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. Any empty <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is one that only has a <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component.</p></div></li><li><p>At the top of the Unity Editor, <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span> is the first option under the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> button. It creates the objects we need. Create two empty <code class="literal">GameObjects</code>, and position one at the base of the turret and the other at the base of the cannon. Also, rename them to <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code> and <code class="literal">CannonPivot</code> respectively. This can be done with the textbox at the very top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, if the object is selected.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window, drag <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code> onto <code class="literal">Tank</code>. This changes the parent of <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code> to <code class="literal">Tank</code>. Then, drag the object, that is, the turret mesh, onto <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code>. In code, we will be rotating the pivot point, not the mesh directly. When a parent object moves or rotates, all of the children objects move with it. When you make this change, Unity will complain about the change to the original hierarchy of the object; just checking to make sure it is a change you want to do and not an accident.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_03_03.png.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Because losing that connection to the prefab can potentially break a game, Unity just wants to be<a id="id217" class="indexterm"></a> sure that we actually want it to happen. So, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> and we can finish working with the tank without other complaints from Unity. We also need to make <code class="literal">CannonPivot</code> a child of <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code>, and the cannon a child of <code class="literal">CannonPivot</code>.</p></li><li><p>To finish off our hierarchy changes, we need to place the camera. Because we want it to appear as if the player is actually in the tank, the camera should be placed behind and above the tank with a tilt slightly downward to focus on a spot a few tank lengths ahead. Once positioned, make it a child of <code class="literal">TurretPivot</code> as well.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec27"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We set up the basic structure that our tank will use. By making use of multiple objects in this way, we can control their movements and actions independently from each other. At this point, instead of having a rigid tank that only points forward, we can tilt, rotate, and aim each piece independently.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"></a>Tip</h3><p>Also, the tank should be centered above the point that you want the whole thing to pivot around. If yours is not, you can select everything that is under the base tank object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window and move it around.</p></div></div></div>
