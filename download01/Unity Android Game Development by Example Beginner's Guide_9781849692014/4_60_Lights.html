They are <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Spotlight</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Point Light</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Area Light</strong></span>. Each of them projects light in a different way and are explained in detail as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span>: This functions<a id="id323" class="indexterm"></a> very much like the sun. It projects all of its light in a single direction. The position of the light does not matter,<a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a> only the rotation. Light is projected over the entirety of the scene in one direction. This makes it perfect for initially adding light to a scene.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Spotlight</strong></span>: This functions just like the ones on a stage. Light is projected in a cone-like shape in a specific direction. <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>Because of this, it is also the most <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>complex light type for the system to calculate. Unity has made significant improvements in how it calculates lights, but overuse of these lights should be avoided.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Point Light</strong></span>: This is the primary<a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a> light type that will be used in your games. <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>It emits light in every direction. This functions just like a light bulb.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Area Light</strong></span>: This is a special-use light. It emits light in a single direction from a plane. Think of it as the big neon<a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a> sign used to advertise a hotel or restaurant. Because of their complexity, these lights can only be used<a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a> when baking shadows. There are too many calculations for them to be used when the game is running.</p></li></ul></div><p>The next obvious question when talking about lights concerns shadows, especially real-time shadows. While real-time shadows add a lot to a scene and are technically possible on any platform, they are very expensive. On top of that, they are a Unity Pro feature. All in all, that makes them a bit too much for your average mobile game.</p><p>On the other hand, there are perfectly viable alternatives that do not cost nearly as much and often look more realistic than real-time shadows. The first is for your environment. In general, the environment in a game never moves and never changes within a specific scene. For this, we have lightmaps. They are extra textures that contain shadow data. Using Unity you can create these textures while making your game. Then, when the game is running, they are automatically applied and your shadows appear. This however does not work for dynamic objects (anything that moves).</p><p>For dynamic objects we have cookies. These are not your grandmother's cookies. In lighting, a cookie is a black and white<a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a> image that is projected onto meshes in the game. This is similar to shadow puppets. The shadow puppets use a cutout to block a part of the light, whereas cookies use black and white images to tell the light where it can cast its light.</p><p>Cookies can also be used to create other nice effects, both static and dynamic, such as cloud cover that pans across the scene. Perhaps light projecting out from a cage. Or, you could use them for making the uneven focus point of a flashlight.</p></div>
