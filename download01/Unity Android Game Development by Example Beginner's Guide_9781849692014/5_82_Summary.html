We also did a little work with AI. It was perhaps among the simplest types of AI but chase behaviors are highly important to all types of games. To utilize all of this, we created an enemy tank. It chased the player and shot at them to reduce their score. To give the edge back to the player, we gave health to the enemy tanks. The player can now shoot the enemy tanks as well as the targets for points. But, we also created some spawn points. Every time a tank was destroyed a new one will be created. In terms of general game play, our Tank Battle game is pretty much complete.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be creating a new game. In order to explore some of the special features of the mobile platform, we will create a Space Fighter game. Nearly all the buttons will be removed from the screen, in favor of new control methods. We will be turning the device's tilt sensors into our steering method. And, we will have to touch enemies and targets to shoot at them. We will also take a look at a different methods of spawning to give the player an endless amount of space to fly through.</p></div>
