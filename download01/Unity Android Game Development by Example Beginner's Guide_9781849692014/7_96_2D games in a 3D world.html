As with everything else, it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, but the choice can be well worth it for generating a pleasing game experience. The foremost of the advantages is that one can use 3D assets for the game. This allows dynamic lighting and shadows to be easily included. However, if using a 2D engine, any shadow would need to be painted directly into the assets and you would be hard-pressed to make it dynamic. On the disadvantage side is the use of 2D assets in the 3D world. It is completely possible to use them, but large file sizes become necessary to achieve the desired detail and keep it from appearing pixelated. Most 2D engines, however, make use of vector art that will keep the image's lines smooth as it is scaled up and down. Also, one is able to use normal animations for the 3D assets, but frame-by-frame animation is generally required for any 2D asset. Altogether, the advantages have outweighed the<a id="id456" class="indexterm"></a> disadvantages for many developers, creating a large selection of great looking 2D games that you may never realize were actually made in a 3D game engine. Now, we shall design another game by recreating the highly popular Angry Birds.</p></div>
