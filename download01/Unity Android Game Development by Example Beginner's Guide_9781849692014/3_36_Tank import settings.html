Any of these settings can<a id="id188" class="indexterm"></a> be changed from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. With your new tank selected, we will go over the import settings for a model here.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_03_01.png.jpg" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The top of the Unity Editor has three tabs: <a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span><a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> page handles the mesh itself, while <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span><a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a> are for importing animations. For now, we only care about the <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> page, so select it if it is not already selected.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Meshes</strong></span> section<a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a> of the <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span> window starts with the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Factor</strong></span> attribute. This is a value that tells Unity how big the mesh is<a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a> by default. One generic unit or one meter from your modeling program translates to one unit in Unity. This tank was made in generic units, so the tank's scale factor is one. If you were working in centimeters when making the tank, the scale factor would be 0.01, because a centimeter is a hundredth of a meter.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The next option, <a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Compression</strong></span>, will become important in the final chapter when we go over the optimization of our<a id="id195" class="indexterm"></a> games. The higher the compression is set, the smaller the file is in the game. However, this will start to introduce weirdness to your mesh as Unity works to make it smaller. For now, leave it <span class="strong"><strong>Off</strong></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Read/Write Enabled</strong></span><a id="id196" class="indexterm"></a> is useful if you want to make changes to the mesh while the game is playing. This could allow you to do some really cool things such as destructible environments where your scripts break the meshes into pieces based on where they are being shot at.<a id="id197" class="indexterm"></a> However, it also means that Unity has to keep a copy of the mesh in memory, which could really start to lag a system if it is complex. This is outside the scope of this book, so unchecking the option is a good idea.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Optimize Mesh</strong></span><a id="id198" class="indexterm"></a> is a good one to leave on, unless you are doing something specific and fancy with the mesh. With it on, Unity does some special magic behind the scenes. In computer graphics and <a id="id199" class="indexterm"></a>especially Unity, every mesh is ultimately a series of triangles being drawn on screen. This option allows Unity to reorder the triangles in the file so that the whole mesh will be drawn faster and more easily.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The next option, <a id="id200" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Generate Colliders</strong></span>, is a useful one if doing complex things with <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span>. Unity has a set of simple collider shapes that should be used whenever possible, because they are easier to process. However, there are situations where they won't quite get the job done, for example, rubble or a half-pipe where the collision shape is too complex to be made with a series of simple shapes. That is why Unity has a <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span> component. With this option checked, a <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span> component is added to every mesh in our model. We will be sticking with simple colliders in this chapter, so leave the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Colliders</strong></span> option off.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Swap UVs</strong></span> <a id="id201" class="indexterm"></a>and <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Lightmap UVs</strong></span> are primarily used when working with lighting, especially lightmaps. Unity can handle two sets of UV coordinates on a model. Normally, the first is used for the texture and the second for the lightmap or shadow texture. If they are in the wrong order, <span class="strong"><strong>Swap UVs</strong></span> will change them, so that the second set now comes first. If you need an unwrap for a lightmap, but did not create one, <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Lightmap UVs</strong></span> will create one for you. We are not working with lightmaps in this project, so both of these can remain off.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The next section of options, <a id="id202" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Normals &amp; Tangents</strong></span>, begins with the <span class="strong"><strong>Normals</strong></span> option. This defines how Unity will get a hold of the normals of your mesh. By default, they are imported from the file; but there is also the option to make Unity calculate them based on the way the mesh is defined. Or, if we set this option to <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span>, Unity will not import the normals. <span class="strong"><strong>Normals</strong></span> are needed if we want our mesh to be affected by real-time lighting or make use of normal maps. We will be making use of real-time lighting in this project, so leave it set to <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tangents</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Smoothing Angle</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Split Tangents</strong></span> are used if your mesh has a normal map. <a id="id203" class="indexterm"></a>Tangents are needed to determine how lighting interacts with a normal-mapped surface. By default, Unity will calculate these for you. Importing tangents is only possible from a few file types. The <a id="id204" class="indexterm"></a>smoothing angle dictates whether shading across an edge would be smooth or sharp, based on the angle between the two faces. The <a id="id205" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Split Tangents</strong></span> option is there to handle a few specific lighting quirks. If lighting is broken by seams, enabling this option will fix it. Normal maps are great for making a low-resolution game look like a high-resolution one. However, because of all the extra files and information needed to use them, they are not ideal for a mobile game. Therefore, we will not be using them in this book and all of these options can be turned off to save memory.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The last section, <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span>, defines how Unity should look for materials. The first option,<a id="id206" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Import Materials</strong></span>, is to decide whether or not a material should be imported. If it is turned off, a default white material will be applied. This material will not show up anywhere in your project; it is a hidden default. For models that will not have any textures, such as collision meshes, this could be turned off. For our tank and nearly every other case, this should be left on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The last two options,<a id="id207" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Material Naming</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Material Search</strong></span><a id="id208" class="indexterm"></a>, work together<a id="id209" class="indexterm"></a> to name and find the materials for the mesh.<a id="id210" class="indexterm"></a> Directly below them, there is a text box that describes how Unity will go about searching for the material. The name of the material being searched for can be the name of the texture used in the modeling program, the name of the material created in the modeling program, or the name of the model plus the material. If a texture name cannot be found, the material name will be used instead. By default, Unity does a <span class="strong"><strong>Recursive-Up</strong></span> search. This means that we start by looking in the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder, followed by any materials that are in the same folder. We then check the parent folder for matching materials, followed by the folder above that. This continues until we either find the material that has the correct name or we reach the root assets folder. Alternatively we have the options of checking the entire project by only looking in the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder that is next to our model. The defaults for these options are just fine. In general, they do not need to be changed. They are most easily changed with the Unity Editor scripting, which will not be covered in this book.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, we have a pair of buttons: <a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.<a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a> Whenever changes are made to the import settings, one of these two buttons must be chosen. The <span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> button cancels the changes and switches the import settings back to what they were before changes were made. <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> confirms the changes and re-imports the model with the new settings. If these buttons are not selected, Unity will complain with a pop up and force a choice before letting you mess with anything else.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_03_02.png.jpg" /></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally, we have two types of previews. The <a id="id213" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Imported Object</strong></span> section is a preview of what the object will look like in the<a id="id214" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, if added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and selected. The <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> window<a id="id215" class="indexterm"></a> is what the model will look like in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. You can click-and-drag in this window to rotate the object and look at it from different angles. Also, there is a little blue button in this window. By clicking on this button, you will be able to add labels to the object. Then, these labels are also searchable in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec26"></a>Setting up the tank</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we have the tank imported, we need to set it up.
