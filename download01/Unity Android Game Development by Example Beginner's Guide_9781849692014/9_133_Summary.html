We first took a look at the various settings, for the assets used in our games, used to keep their file size down while maintaining quality. Next, we learned about some settings that affect the overall game. After that, we explored options for tracking the performance of the game. We first looked at some tools provided by Unity for tracking that performance. Then, we created a tool of our own for tracking script performance in detail. We then took a look at some options for minimizing lag in our games, including utilizing occlusion culling. Now that we know about all of these tools and options, go through the games we created and optimize them. Make them the best they can be.</p><p>In this book we learned a whole lot. We started with learning about Unity, Android, and how to make them work together. Our journey continued with an exploration of Unity's GUI system and the creation of a Tic-tac-toe game. We then learned about the basic assets needed for any game, while starting the creation of a Tank Battle game. Our Tank Battle game then expanded with the addition of a few special camera effects and some lighting. We concluded the creation of the Tank Battle game by introducing some enemies and making them chase the player. The creation of our Space Fighter game taught us about the touch and tilt controls that we can utilize in our game. A short break from that game saw the creation of an Angry Birds clone while learning about physics and the possibilities of a 2D game in Unity. We then returned to the Space Fighter game to add some polish with the addition of sound and particle effects. Finally, our journey concluded by learning about optimizing our games. Thank you for reading this book. Enjoy your experiences with Unity and creating the awesome games you have always dreamed about.</p></div>
