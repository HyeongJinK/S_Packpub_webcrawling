They each can add a lot to the scene, setting the mood and giving that touch of polish that sets a game apart. But there are many effects that cannot stand on their own as one or the other. Explosions, for example, are simply not that impressive unless you have both the visual and auditory effects.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec135"></a>Explosions</h3></div></div></div><p>It is so much more satisfying to<a id="id638" class="indexterm"></a> destroy enemies when they explode. It takes both a particle effect and the sound effect to make a proper explosion. We will start by creating an explosion prefab. Then we will update the player's shooting to spawn the explosion when asteroids and enemy ships are destroyed.</p></div></div>
