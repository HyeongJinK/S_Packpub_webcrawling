Also, as long as one sticks to point lights, the cost to render them stays low.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>At the top of the Unity Editor, select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span>, and lastly <span class="strong"><strong>Point Light</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>With the new light selected, there are a few attributes that we are concerned about in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Range</strong></span>: This is how <a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a>far light will be emitted from the object. The light emitted from this point is brightest at the center and fades to nothing as it reaches the extent of the range. The range is additionally represented as a yellow wire sphere in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span>: This is simply the <a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a>color of the light. By default, it is white; however, any color can be used here. This setting is shared between all light types.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span>: This is the brightness<a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a> of the light. The greater the intensity of the light, the brighter the light will be at its center. This setting is also shared between all light types.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Create and position several more lights, arranging them along the streets to add some more interest to the environment.</p></li><li><p>Using <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> will duplicate the selected object. This can greatly speed up the creation process.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_06.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>While adding these lights, you probably noticed one of their major drawbacks. There is a limit to how many lights will affect a surface in real time. It is possible to <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>somewhat get around this by using more complex meshes. The better option is to use lightmaps, which we'll be seeing in the next section.</p></li><li><p>At the top of the Unity Editor again, select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span>, and this time select <span class="strong"><strong>Spotlight</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Again, select the new light and take a look at it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Spot Angle</strong></span>: This is unique to this type of light. It dictates how wide a cone the light emits. Together with <span class="strong"><strong>Range</strong></span>, it is represented by a<a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a> yellow wire cone in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Add a few spotlights around the fountain in the center of our tank battle city.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Having so many objects<a id="id338" class="indexterm"></a> in a scene starts to clutter the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window, making it hard to find anything. To organize it, you can use empty <code class="literal">GameObjects</code>. Create one and name it <code class="literal">PointLights</code>.</p></li><li><p>By making all of your point lights children of this empty <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window becomes significantly less cluttered.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec57"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We added several lights to the game.<a id="id339" class="indexterm"></a> By changing the lights of the colors, we make the scene much more interesting to look at and play in. However, a drawback of the lighting system is revealed. The city we are using is very simple and there is a limit to the number of lights that can affect a plane at one time. While the look of our scene is still improved, much of the impressiveness is stolen by this drawback.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec58"></a>Lightmaps</h3></div></div></div><p>Lightmaps are great for complex lighting setups that would be too expensive or simply won't work at runtime. They <a id="id340" class="indexterm"></a>also allow you to add detailed shadows to your game world without the expense of real-time shadows. However, it will only work for objects that do not move over the course of a game.</p></div></div>
