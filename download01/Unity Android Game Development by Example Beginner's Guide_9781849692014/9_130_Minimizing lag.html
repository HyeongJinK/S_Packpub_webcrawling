As developers, <a id="id741" class="indexterm"></a>we constantly fight against providing the highest quality experience we can, while maintaining the speeds and responsiveness that <a id="id742" class="indexterm"></a>users expect. It essentially amounts to whether or not the processor on the user's device can handle the cost of providing the game experience. A few, simple objects in your game will result in fast processing. Several complex objects will cost the most processing.</p></div>
