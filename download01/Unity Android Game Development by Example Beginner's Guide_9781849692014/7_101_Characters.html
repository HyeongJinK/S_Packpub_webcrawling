Next, we are going to create a few characters to add some life to the game. We are going to need some evil pigs to destroy and some good birds to throw at them.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec101"></a>The enemy</h3></div></div></div><p>Our first character will be the enemy pig. On their own, they don't actually do anything. So, they are really just the wooden blocks we made earlier that happen to look like pigs. To make their destruction the goal of the game, however, we are going to expand our <code class="literal">LevelTracker</code> script to watch them and trigger a Game Over event if they are all destroyed. We will also expand it to draw the score on the screen and make it save the score for later use. To demonstrate the use of 2D assets in the 3D environment, the pigs are also created as flat textures.</p></div></div>
