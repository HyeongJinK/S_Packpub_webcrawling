Also, utilizing <code class="literal">.blend</code> files in Unity requires Blender to be installed on your system. Blender is a free modeling program available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org</a>. Unity makes use of it in order to convert the previously mentioned files into ones that it can fully utilize.</p></div></li><li><p>When we return to Unity, the fact that we added files will be detected and they will be automatically imported. This is one of the best things about Unity. There is no need to explicitly tell Unity to import. If there are changes within the project's assets, it just does so.</p></li><li><p>You might also <a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a>notice that an extra folder and some files were created when Unity imported our tank. Whenever a new mesh is imported, by default Unity will try to pair it with the materials. We will go into more detail about what a material is in Unity in the next section. For now, it is an object that keeps track of how to display a texture on a mesh. Based on the information in the mesh, Unity looks in the project for a material with the correct name. If one cannot be found, a <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder is created next to the mesh and the missing materials are created inside it. When creating these materials, Unity also searches for the right textures. This is why it is important to add textures to the folder at the same time as the mesh, so that they all can be imported together. If you did not add the textures at the same time as the tank, the section about creating materials will describe how to add textures to materials.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec25"></a>

</h3></div></div></div><p>We just imported our tank into Unity. It is really quite simple. Changes made to any of the assets or folders of the project are automatically detected by Unity, and anything that needs to be is suitably imported.</p></div></div>
