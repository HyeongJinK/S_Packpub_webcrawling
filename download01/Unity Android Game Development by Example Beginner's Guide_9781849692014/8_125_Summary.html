We started with understanding how Unity handles audio files. By adding background music and an alarm system, we put what was learned into practice. We moved on to understanding particle systems, and created engine trails for our player's ship. Finally, we put the two skill sets together and created explosions and laser blasts. Particle systems and audio effects add a lot to the final polish and look of a game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we complete our experience together by taking a look at optimization in Unity. We will take a look at the tools provided for tracking performance. We will also create our own tool to track specific parts of script performance. We will also create our own tool to track specific parts of script performance. We will explore asset compression and other points that we can change to minimize the application footprint. Finally, key points will be discussed for minimizing lag.</p></div>
