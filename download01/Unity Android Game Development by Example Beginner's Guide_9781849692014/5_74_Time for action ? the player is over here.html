Name it <code class="literal">PlayerPosition</code>.</p></li><li><p>This script will start with a single static variable. This variable will simply hold the current position of the player. Because it is static, we will be able to easily access it from the rest of our scripts.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public static Vector3 position = Vector3.zero;</pre></div></li><li><p>For the next lines of code, we make use of the <code class="literal">Start</code> function. This function is automatically called when a scene is first loaded. We use it so that the <code class="literal">position</code> variable can be filled and used as soon as the game starts.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public void Start() {
  position = transform.position;
}</pre></div></li><li><p>The last segment of code simply updates the <code class="literal">position</code> variable in every frame to the player's current position. We also do this in the <code class="literal">LateUpdate</code> function so that it is done after the player has moved. The <code class="literal">LateUpdate</code> function is called at the end of every frame. With that, the player is able to move during the <code class="literal">OnGUI</code> and <code class="literal">Update</code> functions and their position is updated later.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public void LateUpdate() {
  position = transform.position;
}</pre></div></li><li><p>The last thing to do with this script is to add it to the player's tank. So, return to Unity and drag-and-drop the script from the Project window to the tank to add it as a component, just as we have<a id="id384" class="indexterm"></a> done with all our other scripts.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec69"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We created the first script needed for our chase AI. This script simply updates a variable with the player's current position. We will make use of it in our next script, where we will make the enemy tank move around.</p></div></div>
