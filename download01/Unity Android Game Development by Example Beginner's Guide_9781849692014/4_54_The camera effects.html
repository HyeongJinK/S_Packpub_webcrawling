By default, cameras in Unity do this by coloring everything in solid blue. All of the game's meshes are then drawn on top of this blank<a id="id288" class="indexterm"></a> screen. Blue is rather boring for an exciting battle of tanks. So, lucky for us, Unity allows us to change the color. But, pink is not better than<a id="id289" class="indexterm"></a> blue, so we have to change the method of clearing the screen. This is where the skybox comes in. A skybox is just a fancy word for the series of images that form the background sky of any game. Distance fog works in conjunction with the skybox by easing the visual transition between models and background.</p></div></div>
