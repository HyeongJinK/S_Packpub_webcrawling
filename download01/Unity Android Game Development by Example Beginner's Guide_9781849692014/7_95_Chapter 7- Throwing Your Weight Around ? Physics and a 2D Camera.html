<span class="emphasis"><em>In the previous chapter, we learned about the special features of a mobile device and how to create touch and tilt controls. We also created a Space Fighter game to use these new controls. The steering of the ship was done by tilting the device and shooting by touching the screen. Using some special movement tricks, we gave the player an infinite amount of space to fly and enemies to fight.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we take a short break from the Space Fighter game to explore Unity's physics engine. We will also take a look at options for creating a 2D game experience. To do all of this, we will be recreating one of the most popular mobile games on the market, Angry Birds. We will use physics to throw birds and destroy structures. We will also take a look at the creation of a level-selection screen.</em></span>
</p><p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity Physics</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Parallax scrolling</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Isometric camera</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level selection</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be creating a new project for this chapter, so start up Unity and let's begin!</p></div>
