<span class="emphasis"><em>In the previous chapter, we learned about special effects for our games. We added background music to our Space Fighter game. We also created engine trails for our ship. Combining both audio effects and particle systems, we created some explosions and gun blasts. Together, this rounds out the game experience and gives us a very complete-looking game.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we explore our options for optimization. We start by looking at the application footprint, and how to reduce it. We move on to look at the game's performance. We look at the tools that Unity provides and create another one ourselves. With the use of occlusion culling, we can improve the game's performance even further. Finally, we will explore some key areas that can cause lag and how to minimize their effects.</em></span>
</p><p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Minimizing the application footprint</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tracking performance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Minimizing lag</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Occlusion</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be working on both our Space Fighter and Tank Battle games, for this chapter. Start by opening the Space Fighter project.</p></div>
