<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec58"></a>Time for action â€“ adding a skybox and distance fog</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The very first thing we need is a skybox, obviously. We could create our own; however, Unity provides us with several <a id="id290" class="indexterm"></a>excellent ones that will fit our needs just fine.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>At the top of the<a id="id291" class="indexterm"></a> Unity Editor, select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span>. About half way down this list, select <span class="strong"><strong>Skyboxes</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>After a little bit of processing, a new window will pop up. A package in Unity is just a compressed group of assets that have already been set up in Unity. This window displays the contents and allows us to selectively import them. We want them all, so just click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> in the bottom-right corner of this window.</p></li><li><p>A new folder, <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code>, will be added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window. This contains a folder, <code class="literal">Skyboxes</code>, which contains various skybox materials. Select any one of these. You can see in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window that they are normal materials that make use of the Skybox shader. They each have six images, one for each direction.</p></li><li><p>To add the skybox of your choice to the game, first make sure you have the correct scene loaded. If you do not, simply double-click on it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. This is necessary because the settings we are about to change are specific to each scene.</p></li><li><p>Go to the top of the Unity Editor and select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Render Settings</strong></span>. The new group of settings will appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>At the moment we are concerned with the value that is fifth from the bottom, <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox Material</strong></span>. Just drag-and-drop the skybox material into the <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox Material</strong></span> slot and it will be automatically updated. The change can be viewed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>To add distance fog, <a id="id292" class="indexterm"></a>we also adjust it in <span class="strong"><strong>Render Settings</strong></span>. To turn it on, simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Fog</strong></span> checkbox.</p></li><li><p>The next setting, <span class="strong"><strong>Fog Color</strong></span>, allows us to pick a color for the fog. It is good to pick a color that is close to the general color of the skybox.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fog Mode</strong></span> is a drop-down<a id="id293" class="indexterm"></a> list of options that dictate the method Unity will use to calculate the distance fog. For nearly all cases, the default of <span class="strong"><strong>Exp2</strong></span> is suitable.</p></li><li><p>The next three settings, <span class="strong"><strong>Fog Density</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Linear Fog Start</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Linear Fog End</strong></span>, all determine how much fog there is and how close it starts. <span class="strong"><strong>Fog Density</strong></span> is used for the <span class="strong"><strong>Exponential</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Exp2</strong></span> fog modes while the others are used for the <span class="strong"><strong>Linear</strong></span> fog mode. Settings that put the fog at the edge of sight are generally good.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_01.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec48"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We imported several skyboxes<a id="id294" class="indexterm"></a> and added them to the scene. The distance fog <a id="id295" class="indexterm"></a>settings were also turned on and adjusted. Now, our scene has started to look like a real game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec49"></a>Target indicator</h3></div></div></div><p>Another camera effect that is <a id="id296" class="indexterm"></a>rather interesting is the use of multiple cameras. A second camera could be used for making a 3D GUI, a minimap, or perhaps a security camera pop-up. In this next section, we will be creating a system that will point at targets that are nearby. Using a second camera, we will make it appear above the player's tank.</p></div></div>
