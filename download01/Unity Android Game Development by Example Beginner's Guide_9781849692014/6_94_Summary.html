We created a Space Fighter game to try it out. We gained access to the device's accelerometer to detect when it is rotated. This gave our spaceship the ability to be steered. We also made use of the touch screen to give a player the ability to shoot enemies in the game. Because we wanted an infinite amount of space to fly through, we had to make it all without the player moving. Instead, everything else moves around the player, faking the player's movement. It also required a system that continuously spawned new enemies and obstacles around the player, allowing us to keep flying and finding new things to play with.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be taking a short break from our Space Fighter game. Almost certainly the most popular mobile game on the market, Angry Birds is a distinct and not uncommon type of game. In order to learn about Physics in Unity and the possibility of a 2D-style game, we will be making an Angry Birds clone. We will also take a look at Parallax scrolling to create a pleasing background. Before you know it, we will be creating all of the Angry Birds levels that you always wished you could play.</p></div>
