Using cookies, we can<a id="id346" class="indexterm"></a> make them look more interesting than just circles of light.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Start by creating a <span class="strong"><strong>Spotlight</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Position the light in front of the tank and pointing away.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, increase the value of the <span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span> attribute to three. This will make our headlights bright like real headlights.</p></li><li><p>Now we need some cookie textures. At the top of the Unity Editor, select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span>, and lastly <span class="strong"><strong>Light Cookies</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>On the new window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> and wait for the loading bar to finish.</p></li><li><p>We now have a few options to choose from. Inside the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> folder, a new folder was created, <code class="literal">Light Cookies</code> that contains the new textures. Drag <code class="literal">Flashlight</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window and drop it onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Cookie</strong></span> field on the <span class="strong"><strong>Spotlight</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. It is as simple as that to add a cookie to a light.</p></li><li><p>To finish it off, duplicate the light for the second headlight and make them both children of the tank. What good is having headlights if they don't come with us?</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_09.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec62"></a>

</h3></div></div></div><p>We created a pair of headlights<a id="id347" class="indexterm"></a> for our tank using cookies. This is exactly how many other games, especially horror games, create flashlight effects.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec63"></a>Have a go hero – adding a switch</h3></div></div></div><p>Try making a script that will allow the player to turn the headlights on and off. It should be a simple button that toggles the lights. Take a look at the enabled variable that is supplied as part of the light.</p><p>As a simpler challenge, create a lamp that sits on the turret of the tank. Give it a light as well. With this, the player can point a light to where they are shooting and not just in the direction their tank is pointing.</p></div></div>
