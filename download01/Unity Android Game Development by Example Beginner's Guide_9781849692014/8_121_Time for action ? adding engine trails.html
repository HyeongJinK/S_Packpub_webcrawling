Do this by going to the top of the Unity Editor and navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Particle System</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Rename the new particle system to <code class="literal">EngineTrail</code>.</p></li><li><p>First we look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Initial</strong></span> module. We need the <span class="strong"><strong>Looping</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Prewarm</strong></span> checkboxes checked. This will keep the ship looking as if it is moving throughout the game and remove the build up the system would otherwise need to create the effect.</p></li><li><p>Next, we need to control the distance the particles travel. Do this by setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Start Lifetime</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>3</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Start Speed</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>To keep the <a id="id633" class="indexterm"></a>particles sized and positioned properly in space, we need to set the <span class="strong"><strong>Start Size</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>0.8</strong></span> and choose <span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span> for <span class="strong"><strong>Simulation Space</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now we move on to the <span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span> module. We want the particles to fly straight out from the engines. So we use a value of <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Angle</strong></span> option and <span class="strong"><strong>0.2</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span> option.</p></li><li><p>Exhaust tends to fade in color and dissipate in density over time. To achieve this effect, activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Color over Lifetime</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Size over Lifetime</strong></span> modules.</p></li><li><p>For the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> option, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Alpha</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> at the beginning of the gradient and <span class="strong"><strong>255</strong></span> a short way in. As to colors, select a vibrant blue at the beginning, transitioning to white, and then <a id="id634" class="indexterm"></a>gray at the end.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_08_17.png.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>For the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> option, select a linear slope that is maximum at the beginning and minimum<a id="id635" class="indexterm"></a> at the end. This is most easily done by clicking on the curve, to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> label, and selecting the third option from the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Particle System Curves</strong></span> window at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_08_18.png.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> window, duplicate the <code class="literal">EngineTrail</code> object three times and position them behind the engines of the ship. Be sure to rotate them so the particles are emitted away from the ship.</p></li><li><p>Finally, make<a id="id636" class="indexterm"></a> all of them children of the player's ship. If this step is skipped, they will not follow the ship as it moves.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_08_19.png.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec133"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We put into practice <a id="id637" class="indexterm"></a>what we learned about particle systems to create trails for our space ship's engines. Because they are children of the ship and simulate in world space, they move with the ship and trail off as one would expect.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec134"></a>Have a go hero – more trails</h3></div></div></div><p>The enemy ships have engines too. Try adding trails to the enemy ships. Be careful about picking the local or world space to simulate in. Because the ships move to make it look like the player is moving, simulating in world space could have some unusual side effects.</p><p>If you gave the player a turbo boost effect earlier, it is time to add some extra effects to it now. Try changing the length of the trails when the player is boosting. Perhaps the ship taps into a special type of fuel when it boosts. If it burns a different color, then the trails would have to be a different color, or series of colors, when the player is boosting.</p></div></div>
