The chapter was long and we learned a lot. We imported meshes and set up a tank. We created materials so that color could be added to a city. We also animated some targets and learned how to shoot them down. It was a lot and it is time for a break. Play the game, shoot some targets, and gather those points. The project is all done and ready to be built to your device of choice. The build process is the same as both of the previous projects, so have fun!</p><p>The next chapter is about special camera effects and lighting. We will be learning about lights and their types. Our Tank Battle game will expand through the addition of a skybox and several lights. We will also take a look at distance fog. With the addition of shadows and lightmaps, the city we will battle in really starts to become interesting and dynamic.</p></div>
