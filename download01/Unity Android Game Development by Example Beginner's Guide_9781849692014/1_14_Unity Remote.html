It allows developers to connect their Android <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>powered devices to the Unity Editor and provide mobile inputs for testing. This is a definite must for any aspiring Unity and Android developer. If you are using a non-Amazon device, acquiring Unity Remote is quite easy. At the time of writing this book, it could be found on <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>Google Play at <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.androidremote" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.androidremote</a>. It is free and does nothing but connect to the Unity Editor, so the permissions are negligible.</p><p>If, however, you are like the ever-growing Amazon market or seek to target Amazon's line of Android devices, adding Unity Remote becomes a little trickier. First, you need to download the APK. It can be found at: <a class="ulink" href="http://files.unity3d.com/ricardo/AndroidRemote.apk" target="_blank">http://files.unity3d.com/ricardo/AndroidRemote.apk</a>. Be sure to download the file to a location that you can easily get the whole file path for. In the next section, we build a simple application and put it on our device. Follow along from the <span class="strong"><strong>Start Console</strong></span> step, replacing the simple application with the downloaded APK.</p></div>
