They have been around since the dawn of time. A normal shadow is a solid, dark projection of an object onto another surface. The contours of the shadow exactly match the contours of the object. This becomes expensive to <a id="id348" class="indexterm"></a>calculate when characters start to move around randomly.</p><p>A blob shadow is a blot of black texture underneath a character or an object. It usually does not have a clearly definable shape and never matches the contours of the object it is meant to be the shadow of. The blob shadow also, generally, does not change sizes. This makes it significantly easier to calculate, making it the shadow of choice for many generations of video games. That also means it is a better option for our mobile devices where processing speed can quickly become an issue.</p></div>
