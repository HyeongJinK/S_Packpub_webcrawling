When the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component <a id="id460" class="indexterm"></a>is attached to any object, it will be taken over by the physics engine. The object will fall with gravity and bump into any object that has a collider. In our scripts, making use of the <code class="literal">OnCollision</code> function and the <code class="literal">OnTrigger</code> function requires a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component to be attached to at least one of the two interacting objects. However, a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component can interfere with any specific movement we might cause the object to take. Every <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span>, though, can be marked as kinematic, meaning the physics engine will not move it. The <span class="strong"><strong>CharacterController</strong></span> component that we used for our tank is a special, modified <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span>. In this chapter, we will be making heavy use of the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component to tie all of our birds, blocks, and pigs into the physics engine.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec96"></a>Building blocks</h3></div></div></div><p>For our first physics objects, we will create the blocks that the pig castles are built out of. We will be creating three types of blocks: wood, glass, and rubber. With these few simple blocks, we will be able to easily create a large variety of levels and structures to smash with birds.</p></div></div>
