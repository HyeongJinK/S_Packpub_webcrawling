Unity has already done the bulk of the work for us; we just need to add it to the tank.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>We start this one off by importing Unity's blob shadow. Go to the top of the Unity Editor, select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span>, and finally <span class="strong"><strong>Projectors</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> in the new window and take a look in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window for a new folder called <code class="literal">Projectors</code> created under <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code>.</p></li><li><p>Drag the <code class="literal">Blob Shadow Projector</code> prefab from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window to the scene and position it above the tank.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_10.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Unfortunately, the shadow is appearing on top of our tank. To fix this, we need to again <a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a>make use of layers. So, select the tank.</p></li><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> drop-down list, select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Layer...</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the right-hand side of <span class="strong"><strong>User Layer 9</strong></span> and give it the name <code class="literal">PlayerTank</code>.</p></li><li><p>Select your tank once more, but select <code class="literal">PlayerTank</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> drop-down list this time.</p></li><li><p>When the new window pops up, be sure to select <span class="strong"><strong>Yes, change children</strong></span> to change the layer of the whole tank. If you don't, the blob shadow may appear on some parts of the tank while not on other parts.</p></li><li><p>Now, select <code class="literal">Blob Shadow Projector</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip24"></a>Tip</h3><p>The blob shadow is created by the <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> component. This component functions in a similar manner to the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> component. However, it puts an image on the world rather than turning the world into an image and putting it on your screen.</p></div></li><li><p>Take a look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window. The value we are concerned with right now is that of <span class="strong"><strong>Ignore Layers</strong></span>. Right now it is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Nothing</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Nothing</strong></span> and select <code class="literal">PlayerTank</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Layers</strong></span> drop-down list. This will make the projector ignore the tank and only make the blob shadow appear underneath it.</p></li><li><p>The next step is to change the size of the shadow to roughly match the size of the tank. Adjust the value of the <a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Field of View</strong></span> attribute until the size is about right. A value of about 70 seems to be a good place to start from.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_04_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>The final step is to make <code class="literal">Blob Shadow Projector</code> a child of the tank. We need to be able to bring our shadow with us; we don't want to lose it.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec64"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We gave our tank a shadow. <a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a>Shadows are great for making objects, and especially characters, look like they are actually touching the ground. The blob shadow that we used is better than real-time shadows because it is processed faster.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec65"></a>Have a go hero – making it square</h3></div></div></div><p>The texture that the blob shadow came with is round but our tank is mostly square. Try creating your own texture for the blob shadow and use that. Some sort of rectangle should work well.</p><p>If you managed to add your own texture to the blob shadow, then how about taking a look at that cannon? The cannon sticks out of our tank and ruins its otherwise square profile. Use a second blob shadow, attached to the turret, to project a shadow for the cannon. The texture for it will also have to be a rectangle-type shape.</p></div></div>
