First, we discussed the benefits and possibilities when using Unity and Android. That was followed by a whole lot of installation; the JDK, the Android SDK, Unity 3D, and Unity Remote. We then figured out how to connect to our devices through the command prompt. Our first application was quick and simple to make. Finally, we built it and put it on a device.</p><p>The next chapter will see us creating a game that is significantly more interactive, Tic-tac-toe. We will be exploring the wonderful world of graphical user interfaces. So, not only will we make the game, but we will make it look good too.</p></div>
