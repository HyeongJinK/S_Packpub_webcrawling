<span class="emphasis"><em>In the previous chapter, we covered the features of Unity and Android. We also discussed the benefits of using them together. After we finished installing a bunch of software and setting up our devices, we created a simple Hello World application to confirm that everything was connected correctly.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>This chapter is all about <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>). We will start by creating a simple Tic-tac-toe game, using the <a id="id96" class="indexterm"></a>basic pieces of GUI that Unity provides. Following that we will discuss Unity's GUI Styles and GUI Skins. Using what we learned, we will improve the look of our game. Also, we will explore some tips and tricks for handling many different screen sizes of Android devices. Finally, we will learn about a much quicker way to put our games on the device, which was covered in the previous chapter. With all that said, let's jump in.</em></span>
