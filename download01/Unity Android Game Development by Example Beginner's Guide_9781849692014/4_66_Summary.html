We then played around with a turbo boost camera effect. The chapter continued with the lighting of our city. The lights improved greatly when we made use of lightmaps. We finished it off with a look at cookies and blob shadows for use with some special lighting effects.</p><p>In the next chapter, will see the creation of enemies for our game. We will use Unity's pathfinding system to make them move around and chase the player. After this, the player is going to need to be much more active if they hope to keep their points.</p></div>
