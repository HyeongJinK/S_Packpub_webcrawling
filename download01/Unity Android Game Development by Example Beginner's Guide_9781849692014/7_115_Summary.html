By using Unity's physics system, we are able to make all of the levels that we could ever want to play. With this game, we also explored options for creating a 2D game in a 3D environment. Our birds and slingshot are 3D assets, giving us the ability to light and shade them. The pigs and the background, however, are 2D images, reducing our lighting options, but can allow for some greater detail in the assets. The 2D images were also crucial in the creation of the parallax scrolling effect of the background. Finally, the building's blocks appear to be 2D, but are actually 3D blocks. We also created a level-selection screen. From there, the player can see their high scores and pick any of the levels that we created to play.</p><p>In the next chapter, we return to the Space Fighter game we started in the previous chapter. We are going to create and add all of the special effects that finish off a game. We will add the shooting and explosion sound effects that every space game needs. We will also add various particle effects. When ships are shot at, they will actually explode, rather than just disappearing.</p></div>
