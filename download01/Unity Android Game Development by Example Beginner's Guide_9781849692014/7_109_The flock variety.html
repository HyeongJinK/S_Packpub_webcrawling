We will create three more birds that each have a unique special ability: a yellow bird that accelerates, a blue bird that splits into multiple birds, and a black bird that explodes. With these our flock will be complete.</p><p>To make the creation of these birds easier, we will be making use of a concept called <span class="strong"><strong>inheritance</strong></span><a id="id519" class="indexterm"></a>. Inheritance allows a script to expand upon the functions it is inheriting without the need to rewrite them. If used correctly, this can be very powerful and, in our case, will aid in the quick creation of multiple characters that are largely similar.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec112"></a>The yellow bird</h3></div></div></div><p>First, we will create the yellow bird. Largely, this bird functions exactly as the red bird. However, when the player touches the screen, the bird's speed increases. By extending the <code class="literal">Bird</code> script that we created earlier,<a id="id520" class="indexterm"></a> this bird's creation becomes quite simple.</p></div></div>
