This time it is called <code class="literal">BlackBird</code>.</p></li><li><p>Do not forget to adjust line four to extend the <code class="literal">Bird</code> script and not <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class BlackBird : Bird {</pre></div></li><li><p>This script has two variables. The first is the size of the explosion and the second is its strength.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public float radius = 2.5f;
public float power = 25f;</pre></div></li><li><p>Once more we override the <code class="literal">DoSpecial</code> function<a id="id529" class="indexterm"></a>, first marking that we did it. Next, we use <code class="literal">Physics.OverlapSphere</code> to acquire a list of all of the objects that are within the range of the bird's explosion. The function then loops through the list, skipping any empty slots and those without rigidbodies. If the object does exist and has a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component attached, we call <code class="literal">AddExplosionForce</code> to simulate the way an explosion's strength against you is reduced the further you are from it. We give the function the explosion's strength, followed by the bird's position and radius. The value <code class="literal">3</code> is a vertical modifier. It does not interfere with the distance an object is from the explosion but, instead, adjusts the angle the explosion hits it at. This <code class="literal">3</code> moves the force to below the object, because explosions that throw debris up are cooler than ones that push out. <code class="literal">ForceMode.Impulse</code> is again used to apply the force immediately. Finally, the function destroys the exploded bird.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">protected override void DoSpecial() {
  didSpecial = true;

  Collider[] colliders = Physics.OverlapSphere(transform.position, radius);

  foreach(Collider hit in colliders) {
    if(hit == null) continue;
    if(hit.rigidbody != null)
      hit.rigidbody.AddExplosionForce(power, transform.position, radius, 3, ForceMode.Impulse);
  }

  Destroy(gameObject);
}</pre></div></li><li><p>As with the last two, apply your new script to your new bird and turn it into a prefab. You now have four birds<a id="id530" class="indexterm"></a> to choose from when selecting the slingshot arsenal for each level.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec118"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>

Create an explosive crate. Extend the <code class="literal">Plank</code> script to make it. When enough damage is done to the crate, trigger the explosion. For an added challenge, instead of making the crate explode, configure it to throw out a few bombs that explode when they hit something.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692014/graphics/2014OT_07_06.jpg" /></div></div></div>
