<span class="emphasis"><em>Welcome to the wonderful world of mobile game development. Whether you are still looking for the right development kit or have already chosen one, this chapter will be most important. In this chapter we explore the various features that come with choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Unity</strong></span> as your development environment and <span class="strong"><strong>Android</strong></span> as the target platform. Through comparison with major competitors, it is discovered why Unity and Android stand on the top of the pile. Following that, we examine how Unity and Android work together. Finally, the development environment is set up and we create a simple Hello World application to test that everything is set up correctly. For the purposes of this book, it is assumed you are working in a Windows-based environment.</em></span>
