We first became familiar with drawing buttons and the like to the GUI. After delving into the depths and gaining understanding of GUI Styles and GUI Skins, we applied the knowledge to make our game look even better. The game continued to improve when we added some dynamic positioning to our GUI elements. The opening and closing screens became centered, while the game board dynamically scaled to fill the screen. Finally, we explored an alternative build method for putting our game onto devices.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be starting a new and more complex game. The Tank Battle game that we will be creating will be used to gain understanding with the basic building blocks of any game: meshes, materials, and animations. When all is done, we will be able to drive a tank around a colorful city and shoot animated targets.</p></div>
