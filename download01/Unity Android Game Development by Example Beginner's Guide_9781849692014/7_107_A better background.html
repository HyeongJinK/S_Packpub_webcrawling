This simply means that the background is created in layers that scroll by at different speeds. Think of it as if looking out the window of your car. The objects that are far away appear to hardly move, while the ones that are near move by quickly. In a 2D game, it gives the illusion of depth and adds a nice touch to the look of the game. For this background, we will be layering several materials on a single plane.</p></div>
