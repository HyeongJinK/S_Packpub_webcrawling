<span class="emphasis"><em>In the previous chapter, we took a short break from our Space Fighter game to learn about physics and 2D games in Unity. We created a clone of Angry Birds. The birds utilized physics to fly through the air and destroy the pigs and their structures. We utilized parallax scrolling to make a pleasing background effect. We also created a level selection screen to load the game's various scenes from.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we return to the Space Fighter game. We are going to add many special effects that will round out the game experience. We start by learning about the controls that Unity provides when working with audio. We move on to add some background music to the game and warning sounds when anything gets too close. Next, we learn about particle systems, creating engine trails for our ship. Finally, we combine the effects of the chapter to create bullet blasts and explosions.</em></span>
