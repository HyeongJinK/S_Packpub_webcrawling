The reason for this has to do more with the definition of adaptive audio than what it means with respect to implementation. So, perhaps we should establish a proper definition of what is adaptive audio before we get too far into things. Here is a good broad definition of the term as it applies to modern game development:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Adaptive audio" is a term used to describe audio and music that reacts appropriately to - and even anticipates - gameplay. Guy Whitmore (Gamasutra)</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>While that definition does sound somewhat abstract, it really does a good job of defining what adaptive audio is. It is audio that anticipates, adapts to, and reacts with gameplay in order to enhance gameplay. The critical word in that definition is gameplay and that is what separates it from dynamic audio. We will define dynamic audio as audio that reacts to or is a consequence of environmental or level changes. The environmental zones and wind effect we developed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Audio Mixing</em></span>, would be classified as dynamic audio.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note76"></a>Note</h3><p>You may hear the terms dynamic, adaptive ,and interactive audio used interchangeably. We make the distinction between dynamic and adaptive audio in order to avoid confusion between terminology and definitions. As this aspect of audio development is still quite new, these definitions may still evolve and you may find a need to refer to adaptive audio as dynamic.</p></div><p>In case you are still a little confused on the definition of adaptive audio, we will look at some gameplay scenarios using it in games, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">As the player approaches a combat area, the music will quicken in pace, become louder, and feature more instruments.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When a player is about to be surprised, the mood of the music becomes somber with undertones of apprehension and tension.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">If the player is quickly approaching the end of a level, the music quickens and becomes more celebratory. However, if the player fails, the music will become somber and express their defeat.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The sound of the players, footsteps may quicken or become hushed, depending on the mood or state of the game.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A player may make or hear encouraging or discouraging vocal cues based on the game state or other actions.</li></ul></div><p>In the preceding list, there are three <span>good</span> examples of adaptive music, and if you have played any games recently, you will likely have come across them. The adaptive sound examples using footsteps and vocal cues are examples you are less likely to come across or notice but they are also out there.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note77"></a>Note</h3><p>In this book, we are going to spend plenty of time reviewing adaptive audio implementations using another tool. We will first start with Unity and demonstrate how the features you learned thus far can be used to implement adaptive audio. From there we will cover another professional mainstream tool for implementing adaptive audio as well as performing other audio tasks. By the end of those chapters, you should be more than comfortable enough to determine what audio tool will work best for your needs in the future.</p><p>The reason we will be covering two different implementations of adaptive audio isn't because it is the next big thing, which it is, but to demonstrate the crossover in skills and knowledge. Furthermore, while Unity has done a great job with the Audio Mixer, it still lacks functionality that is available in other tools and this will also be demonstrated.</p></div><p>Assuming we want to go ahead and implement adaptive audio, how should we go about it? How do we cue up or activate/deactivate it? The list here shows some strategies or options for controlling what triggers adaptive audio:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Event triggers</strong></span>: These <span>are</span> used to detect when a player has entered an area, portal, or passageway. There will be typically several different triggers of various strength set around the level. This is similar to our environmental zones but it will typically be more structured.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Proximity triggers</strong></span>: These are used to detect the distance to <span>opponents</span> or enemies. As the distance narrows, the adaptive level will increase. Each level will typically denote an additional increase in pace or tension in the audio.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Game state</strong></span>: Elements, <span>such</span> as player health, enemy health, time to finish a task, and other similar game state elements can be used.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Others</strong></span>: The list here could be endless based on the constant variations of gameplay game developers and designers will come up with. Use your imagination or try to think of some other examples of innovative triggers used to change audio. Think about this the next time you play an AAA game, and see if you can spot the triggers.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip78"></a>Note</h3><p>We use AAA games as the benchmark for users of adaptive audio, but it really is being used all over in various titles, whether developers want to admit it or not.</p></div><p>If you are still struggling with the definition of what is adaptive audio, do not worry, we will dig into some examples soon enough. In the next section, we cover how to build some triggers for cueing adaptive audio changes.</p></div>
