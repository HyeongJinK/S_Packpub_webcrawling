Reaper falls on the more high end of professional tools, but it is priced very reasonably and provides for a substantial trial period of 60 days. It only makes sense then that you learn to work with a more capable tool. If we started with a free basic tool, it is likely you would quickly outgrow it. Let's get started by downloading and installing Reaper by following the instructions as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open you <span>web</span> browser to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.reaper.fm/" target="_blank">http://www.reaper.fm/</a>.</li><li>At the top of the page, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Download Reaper</code></strong> link to go to the downloads page.</li><li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the version <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Mac</strong></span> and 32 or 64 bit, that best matches your operating system and click on the link to <span>start</span> downloading <span>the</span> software.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip159"></a>Note</h3><p>Linux installation of Reaper is supported through the use of WINE. WINE is the compatibility layer that will allow you to run supported Windows applications on top of Linux. You can learn more about WINE at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">https://www.winehq.org/</a>.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Wait for the software to download and then launch as you normally would any other application.</li><li>Follow the software installation utility to install the software into it's default location.</li><li>When the software has finished installing, launch Reaper as you normally would any application. Depending on your installation, the software may automatically run after being installed.
</li></ol></div><p>Â </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>After the software launches, you will see an interface similar to the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/0f5f4f2d-0328-45b1-b54d-9fa06c4a909a.png" /></div><p>Basic Reaper interface with track loaded</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Right-click (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac) on the dark gray area beside the track area, and then from the menu, select Insert new track. This is also shown in the preceding screenshot.</li><li>If you want, you can press the play button, but there is no audio tracks so there will be nothing to hear.</li></ol></div><p>Reaper is a professional commercial tool for music composition, so don't be surprised if the interface is a little overwhelming at first. However if you have followed along through the book or done sound design previously, then several elements of the interface will seem quite familiar by now. While the first part of the installation was straightforward, we still need to configure some other elements in order to get completely up and running, which we will do so in the next section.</p></div>
