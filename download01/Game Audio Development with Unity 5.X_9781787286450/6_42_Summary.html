First, you learned about the origins of FMOD and how relevant it is to the industry as an audio development tool. From there, we downloaded and installed FMOD Studio. After that, we returned to doing some basic exercises of setting up audio in our village scene the FMOD way. You then spent some time learning how effects and mixing worked in FMOD, how it differed from Unity in some ways but also shared many similarities in others. Finally, we looked to replicate some of the functionality in one of our previous examples using FMOD. What we found is that we were able to do most of the same things with only a little code using the functionality provided by parameters, snapshots, and triggers within FMOD.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue our work with FMOD Studio and get into more advanced development exercises, including scripting and, of course, enhancing our adaptive audio examples we worked with in the previous chapter.</p></div>
