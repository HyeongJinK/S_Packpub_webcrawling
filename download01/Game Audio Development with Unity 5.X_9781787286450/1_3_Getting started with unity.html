Click on the button to download the Unity Download Assistant with your web browser.</li><li>After the package has completed downloading, open it as you would any other program. The Unity Download Assistant is <span>relatively</span> small so it should download quite quickly.

After the installer launches, you will see a screen similar to the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a4342b8f-c4b7-4d9b-8deb-d146d766e720.png" /></div><p>Unity Download Assistant starting</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note5"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are unable to install software on your computer due to security restrictions or other account settings, be sure to contact your administrator and ask them to give you access or have them install the software. During the course of this book, we will be downloading several software packages so it is advisable that you have the ability to install new software on your machine in order to complete all the exercises in the book.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Next</code></strong> button to continue.

The <span>next</span> page will likely offer you an option to choose between 32 and 64-bit architecture. It is usually best to take the default (64 bit in most cases) and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Next</code></strong> button to continue.</li><li>The next page will allow you to choose the Unity components you want to install. This page allows you to choose from a number of components to install along with Unity. For the purposes of this book, you only need to install the default components. However, if you feel you may need or want other components, such as Android or iOS, feel free to select those as well. Just be sure to have the three main components selected as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/28fef1b4-0eb1-42a3-862b-b61626e29d16.png" /></div><p>The Choose Components section of the Unity install</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>After you have made your component selections, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Next</code></strong> button to continue. For the next couple of dialog pages, just keep the defaults and let the installation download and install Unity. Since this can take a while, feel free to grab your beverage of choice while you wait for the installation to complete.</li></ol></div><p>The <span>Unity</span> installation will generally run very smoothly, but if you do encounter some issues, it is best to follow the recovery instructions the installer may provide. If that doesn't fix the issue, just do a quick search and check the Unity forums. Unity has a huge community of developers that are very eager to assist newcomers with any issues, and it is almost certainly likely someone has already encountered a similar issue to yours.</p><p>Once the Unity installer has finished installing Unity, follow the instructions here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>On the last page of the installer, you will usually be prompted with an option to launch Unity right away. Be sure that option is selected and then exit the installer.</li><li>As the program launches, you may get a notice to provide an exception in your firewall; be sure to allow this. After Unity launches, you will be welcomed by a login screen as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/871b2a5c-7f96-45b7-8850-2ef20909669f.png" /></div><p>Unity login or welcome screen</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li><p>If you have never installed Unity before, you will need to create a Unity Account.

From there, complete that account setup, and when you are done, return to this item.</p></li><li><p>Now that you have a Unity account created, enter your email and password in the dialog and then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sign In</code></strong> button. After you sign in, you will be directed to the project page.</p></li></ol></div><p>That completes your first step to becoming a Unity developer.

Perform the following directions to create a new Unity project:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>If this is your first time running Unity, at this stage, you will have a dialog with a button allowing you to create a new project; click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>NEW</code></strong>. For those of you who have jumped here from another section in the book, be sure to launch Unity and make sure you are logged in with your Unity account. From there select the <strong class="userinput"><code>NEW</code></strong> project button at the top of the Unity start page.</li><li>The project dialog will open. Enter the project name as <code class="literal">GameAudioBasics</code> and then keep the defaults for all the other settings as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/e6e5e656-4543-4353-8176-c7012a3c749b.png" /></div><p>Creating a new project in Unity</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>After you fill in the Project name, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Project</code></strong> button.
</li><li>Unity will close the dialog, and you will see a progress dialog flash as the project is initialized and the interface loads. When <span>Unity</span> is done loading, you will see a screen that looks similar to the following window:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/b4f042a3-4225-4f4f-9a9b-5091bd58ea31.png" /></div><p>Unity interface</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note6"></a>Note</h3><p>If you have run Unity before or if you are using a different license, such as pro, your screen may appear to be quite different. Aside from any themes applied, you can return to the default layout by selecting from the menu <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Layouts</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Default</code></strong>.</p></div><p>Now that we have Unity running, let's review what each of the main windows or elements are for. You can follow along using the reference numbers shown in the preceding window <span>screenshot</span> to match the items in the list here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy window (1)</strong></span>: This window shows the currently displayed scenes and scene elements called a <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in Unity. Currently, there should be a scene labeled <strong class="userinput"><code>Untitled</code></strong> in the window. Click on the arrow beside the scene to expand it and then click on the items beneath the scene. Notice how the other windows change depending on your selection.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scene view (2)</strong></span>: You can think of the scene window or the view as the design canvas for your game project. In this view, you can select and move objects around using the mouse or the principal direction arrows (the colored arrows). Feel free to select objects in the view and move them around. Don't worry about moving things out of place or getting lost as we are creating a new scene before we start building anything of importance.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Inspector window (3)</strong></span>: This window exposes and allows you to edit the properties and components of the currently selected GameObject. A lot of the time you spend working in Unity will be editing values in this window. Again, feel free to explore this window by editing some properties of a GameObject.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Project window (4)</strong></span>: This window shows all the resources or assets you have in the entire Unity project. As you can, see the project is currently quite bare. Not to worry, we will be quickly adding new assets.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Game view (5)</strong></span>: This window or view shows how the game will look to the player. It differs from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view because it only shows what the player sees. If you click on the game window tab, you will see a sparse view of the ground layer and sky. Again, this is because we have yet to add anything interesting.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Play mode (6)</strong></span>: This is the set of buttons at the top of the Unity interface control running the game in the editor. The buttons allow you to play and pause the game play. If you click on the play button right now, not much will happen other than the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view will present itself.</li></ul></div><p>At an advanced level, that covers the main elements of the Unity interface without getting bogged down in too many details. It could very well take you months or years to become an expert in using all the features of Unity. So, in order to not overwhelm you, we will only focus on the relevant information you need to complete an exercise.</p><p>So far we have been looking at an empty project and scene. In the next section, we will import a project from the Unity Asset Store.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="01lvl2sec10"></a>Downloading and importing project assets</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the really great features of <span>Unity</span> is the Unity Asset Store. Game development is a complex process that requires many artistic skills in multiple areas to develop quality assets, such as 3D models, animation, textures, sound, music, shaders, and more. Chances are, if your development team is just you or a small group of developers and artists, your team will lack the skillset or time to develop all the assets for your project. Fortunately, the Unity Asset Store provides professional game quality assets at very competitive pricing or in some cases for free. Unity itself also provides a number of high-quality sample projects free of charge on the store. We will be using a couple of those projects in this book as the base for our exercises in audio development.</p><p>Follow the instructions here to <span>download</span> and import the project we will use <span>for</span> the rest of the exercises in this chapter:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>From the menu select <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Asset Store</code></strong>. This will open a new tab beside the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> views called <strong class="userinput"><code>Asset Store</code></strong>.</li><li>After the page loads in the window, there should be a search box visible at the top of the window. Enter the text <code class="literal">unity viking village</code> in the search box and click on the search button as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/fc88deee-342d-4511-92dc-0019855d7a79.png" /></div><p>Searching in the Unity Asset Store
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>When the search completes, there will be a list of search results. The first result in the list should match <span class="emphasis"><em>Viking Village</em></span> from Unity Technologies.
