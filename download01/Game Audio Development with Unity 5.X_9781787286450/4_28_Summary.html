We started by looking at how to create, record, and transition snapshots, which we then applied to a practical example of a pause function for our scene. After that, we looked at constructing a dynamic wind effect that had several moving parts but could be used in other games. This led into another larger discussion of audio environmental zones. Audio environmental zones were areas where we wanted to simulate differences in our global audio due to things such as terrain, buildings, proximity to objects, and so on. We then implemented an environmental zone in one area of our village level, after which, we loaded the fully completed scene showing the addition of several zones representing areas of exposure, shelter, crossings, and partial cover. Finally, we diverged to create a new scene and worked on creating a dynamic music mix using four different audio clips.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue exploring the functionality of the Audio Mixer as it applies to an entire new era of mixing called adaptive audio. As this is the first chapter on adaptive audio, we will cover an introduction and discussion of definitions of dynamic and adaptive audio. After that, we will build a couple of examples using both sound effects and music.</p></div>
