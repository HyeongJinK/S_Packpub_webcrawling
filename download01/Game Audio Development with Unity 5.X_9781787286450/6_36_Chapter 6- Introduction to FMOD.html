<div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06"></a>Chapter 6. Introduction to FMOD</h2></div></div></div><p> is the oldest commercial audio engine, first published in March 1995, and originally just worked with MOD files, hence the name. It is without exception the standard in audio development tools for game development and has been used for hundreds of AAA titles. The Unity audio engine is FMOD, although that shared heritage may not become evident until you start working with the Audio Mixer. Of course, no book on audio development with Unity or any other game engine would be complete without at least one chapter on working with FMOD. Therefore, we are going to spend a couple of chapters working with <span>FMOD</span> and this entire chapter will be an introduction. We will cover the basics of setting up and using FMOD for Unity and how it can work to develop adaptive audio. However, as we will see, FMOD is a choice not all teams may want to take or decide they need, especially if they have become comfortable working with the Audio Mixer.</p><p>We are going to devote this entire chapter to introducing FMOD Studio and how it integrates into Unity for your projects (games) audio development. FMOD Studio is the DAW software, that is powered by FMOD, and is used for audio game development that was previously known as FMOD Designer. While a whole book could likely be devoted to working with FMOD Studio, we are going to keep it simple by just adapting some of the demonstrations we have worked on thus far. Not only will this allow you to compare tools, it will also show you the similarities between the Audio Mixer and FMOD Studio. Here is the list of topics we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Getting started with FMOD Studio</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Back to the basics</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Effects and mixing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Mixing in a reverb effect</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Parameters, snapshots, and triggers</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note93"></a>Note</h3><p>When we speak of FMOD, we are referring to the entire audio system, which in our case, also encompasses FMOD Studio. Assume from now on that any reference to FMOD is a reference to FMOD Studio unless mentioned otherwise.</p></div><p>While our goal will be to demonstrate the capabilities of FMOD Studio in the development of adaptive audio and music, we certainly will need to cover some of the basics first. FMOD is a complicated piece of software, and we will need to understand some setup before diving into the deep end and developing an adaptive audio example. Therefore, in the next section, we will indeed start with the basics by covering FMOD installation and the basic setup.</p></div>
