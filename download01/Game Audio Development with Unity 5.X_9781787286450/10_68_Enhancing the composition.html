This is no different than us enhancing the look of a scene through better lighting, shaders, or post effects. The overuse of enhancements can drown out the original intent. We, therefore, need to be careful and self-edit, in order to not go too far.</p><p>We are going to add a couple of additional tracks in order to enhance our very simple song and hopefully give it more depth and interest. Follow the instructions to add the new tracks to our composition:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Reaper and from the menu and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual instrument on new track</code></strong>. Then, when the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> dialog opens, this time select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VSTi:ReaSynth(Cockos)</code></strong> instrument. This is a synthesizer we are going to use as our bass line track. Select <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> and then configure the instrument as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/665e8665-0cdc-416b-838d-7a77bb02bbe2.png" /></div><p>Configuring the ReaSynth synthesizer as a bass instrument
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip176"></a>Note</h3><p>If you have other instruments that you have downloaded and would prefer to use for the bass, then go ahead. This is after all your song and you are in complete control.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New MIDI track</code></strong>. Drag the track to fit the same region as the tracks above it. Then, double-click on the MIDI region to open the editor.</li><li>For our base line, we are just going to alternate back and forth between the main key chords (E and C). Focus the editor on or around <strong class="userinput"><code>C4</code></strong> and draw the notes as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/3359760c-0d47-4329-a50d-024f482023a0.png" /></div><p>Drawing the notes for the bass line</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Play the tracks and listen to <span>how</span> the bass line enhances the song. Of course, if you feel those bass line notes collide with the melody, then feel free to move them around or choose different notes. Just remember to use the same three-note scale. When you are done testing, close the bass line editor window.</li><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual instrument on new track,</code></strong> and when the FX dialog opens, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VSTi:ReaSynthDrum(Cockos)</code></strong> instrument. You will be prompted with a <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Routing Confirmation</code></strong> dialog; just select <strong class="userinput"><code>NO</code></strong> to add any additional tracks.

Double-click to open the editor and notice that this time some of the keys are labeled with drum sounds as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f58f7f66-3197-4017-8f00-ad27f2ebbbad.png" /></div><p>The labeled keys of the ReaSynthDrum instrument</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Use your mouse to click on the various keys, and you will see only the labeled keys make sound. You can add a simple rhythm to your tune by drawing one note every three columns on the Snare. Try that beat and see how it sounds with the rest of the tracks. Chances are it may not blend with your melody, in which case you will need to adjust the notes to a more pleasant beat.</li><li>Try adding just a couple notes/tones in a beat or rhythm that works with your melody. At this point, you are on your own, but if you keep things simple, you should be fine. When you are done editing and are happy with your song, save the project.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip177"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are still having trouble composing anything you like, and it will happen, there is always another option. You can download other MIDI tracks of almost any music you want online. You can then use those MIDI tracks as a basis for editing and rebuilding your own music. This will even allow you to change instruments, tempo, and more from the original song. Unless you are going to purchase the rights to the song, just be careful on how much inspiration you use from well known music in your game score.</p></div><p>Now that we have a simple song completed, in the next section we are going to record it to file, for later playback in our game.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note178"></a>Note</h3><p><strong class="userinput"><code>QUIZ TIME</code></strong><span class="strong"><strong></strong></span>Answer the following questions:
