We covered a lot of advanced content using FMOD in this chapter, and hopefully you are fairly comfortable now using the tool for your game development needs. We covered a lot of material in this chapter quite quickly by starting on replicating the environmental zones we developed for Audio Mixer earlier. Then, we advanced to the next phase of the zones example by adding dynamic wind and this allowed us to review the internals of FMOD scripting in Unity. After that, we jumped back to adaptive audio and the footsteps example that we upgraded to run with FMOD, while also adding other enhancements along the way. From there, we moved onto working with adaptive music again using FMOD, where we spent an extensive amount of time reviewing various techniques for extracting and re-sequencing the various musical phrases our game level would use. Finally, we looked into more advanced transition techniques that allowed us to blend our more awkward transitions seamlessly.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will go back to Unity and this time look at how we can visualize audio. Being able to visualize the beats of music or frequency changes can provide your game with new and interesting effects.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
