It gives the sound designer or developer the ability to create professional quality audio that can be used across platforms and even game engines. Getting experienced with such a tool will take some time and certainly not all the capabilities can be explored in a single chapter. While in the last chapter, we only started covering the basics of using FMOD with Unity by completing some simple and familiar tasks. For this chapter, we will go far deeper into FMOD and explore the complex tasks of creating dynamic and adaptive audio, which took us a couple of chapters using the Unity Audio Mixer. We plan to only cover the same material in a single chapter, not because FMOD is so powerful, but because all the background material was previously covered in earlier chapters. Of course there will still be plenty of sample exercises and tasks for you to get up to speed with using FMOD quickly.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the tasks of creating dynamic and adaptive audio with FMOD. Since we have covered all the background material already in previous chapters, this chapter will be almost entirely hands on and in the software. There will also be plenty of repetitive tasks using FMOD that should make you more familiar and comfortable with the tool. Here is a summary of what we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dynamic wind and environmental zones</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Unity scripting with FMOD</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Revisiting the footsteps example</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adaptive music with FMOD</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Transition timelines and stingers</li></ul></div><p>As already mentioned, this chapter will cover several complex examples and it is strongly suggested, as always, that you work through the exercises. Ultimately, you will be rewarded for your work. For those FMOD masters or readers that just don't have the tools or time, unfortunately no single completed project can be provided. However, the individual completed FMOD and Unity projects will be available for you to combine into the final example on your own.</p></div>
