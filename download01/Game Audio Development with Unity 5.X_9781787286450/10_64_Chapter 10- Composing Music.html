However, most of these sites are essentially artist demo and portfolio sites, where they feature their wares or talents. While in some cases this will work for games that only require a few effects or music, it certainly doesn't scale well; especially, if you plan to incorporate adaptive music throughout your game. In such a case, having the ability to compose or mix and match your own music becomes essential. Composing your own music does require additional knowledge and time, but with the advent of excellent software, it may not be as difficult as you think. Furthermore, even if you don't have the time to compose your own music at a minimum understanding, the basics of music theory and composition will make you a better adaptive music designer or developer.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to explore music and sound composition. We will start with downloading a music <span>composition</span> tool called <span class="strong"><strong>Reaper</strong></span>. After that, we will cover the basics of music theory and composition. We will then use that knowledge to develop a unique score and record it. Here is a summary of the topics we will be covering in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Getting started with Reaper</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">MIDI and virtual instruments</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Basic music theory</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Enhancing the composition</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Recording music and vocals</li></ul></div><p>In this chapter, we will have no contact with Unity or FMOD, yet we may still put things in the context of those software products. If you have jumped ahead to this chapter and have a basic understanding of audio mixing, then you should be alright to continue. However, if you have no background in audio mixing then you should go back to the start of the book and review the first three chapters.</p></div>
