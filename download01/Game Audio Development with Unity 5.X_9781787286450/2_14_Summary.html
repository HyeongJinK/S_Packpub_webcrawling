Even a basic understanding of scripting will be essential to sound designers or other artists working on Unity projects, as it provides them with the ability to make simple changes without interrupting a dedicated developer. From a basic scripting introduction, we worked our way into a more practical example of writing a simple musical keyboard. It not only introduced additional scripting concepts but also exposed how some of the essential audio source component properties can be altered to match an instrument. After that, we jumped back into the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> project and looked at another good scripting example that showcased weapons. Through repeated testing of our scene we then realized our audio was becoming quite repetitive. The solution was to introduce volume and pitch randomization on our audio playback to introduce variation and make those sounds less repetitive. Finally, we looked at one last example with background music on our scene and controlling the looping play time.</p><p>Even this early in the book, we managed to cover many of the core audio components introduced in Unity 4.x and earlier. In the next chapter, we will jump into the new audio mixing features introduced in Unity 5 and start to explore a whole new world of audio development with Unity.</p></div>
