This default mismanagement of resources may cause performance issues for your target platform. Likewise, while FMOD is an excellent and powerful tool, it also has some performance pitfalls you need to be aware of, if it is your chosen audio system. In fact, understanding the performance limitations of either audio implementation may be a deciding factor for which system you use for your game and target platforms. After all, game development is always about squeezing every little bit out of your platform, in order to provide the best experience for the player. Finally, we will finish with various troubleshooting tips that can help you in your current and future audio development efforts.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover audio performance and troubleshooting with Unity and FMOD. Performance tuning is an essential process for any aspect of game development and audio is no exception to this. After covering performance for both audio systems, we will review some helpful troubleshooting tips. The following is a summary of the main areas we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio performance considerations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Profiling performance with Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio optimization tips and tricks for Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">FMOD performance and optimization</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio troubleshooting</li></ul></div><p>This chapter will work off from previous developed exercises. It is suggested that the reader should have at least reviewed the relevant chapters with Unity and/or FMOD, in order to cover the corresponding sections on performance. A reader with experience in Unity/FMOD could get by, assuming they have mastered the relevant software. This means, you should at least do a quick review up to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using the Audio Mixer for Adaptive Audio</em></span>, for Unity performance optimization and/or <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>FMOD for Dyanmic and Adaptive Audio</em></span>, for the section on FMOD performance. For readers here looking for troubleshooting tips, jump ahead to the last section in the chapter.</p></div>
