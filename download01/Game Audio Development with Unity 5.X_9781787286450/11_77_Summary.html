We first looked at the considerations you should take into account when developing for your platform. After that, we looked at how to use the Unity Profiler and specifically looked at profiling audio performance. From there, we broke down some strategies for optimally handling resources and effects. This diverted us to cover profiling the FMOD audio system with FMOD Studio and how to identify and resolve issues. Finally, we looked at a troubleshooting section which is intended to help readers having issues with book's exercises or with the issues in the future.</p><p>That completes our journey through game audio development with Unity. Hopefully, you are able to take away a number of audio development skills that you can apply to your own games. While we tried to cover all aspects of game audio, in truth, not a single book could ever encompass all of it. Instead it is hoped that you use this base of new knowledge as a platform to build on and expand. There is plenty of excellent information online in many areas of game audio and other audio development that you can use now to extend your knowledge. We wish you the best of luck in your future game development, sound design, or music production efforts.</p></div>
