You learned the basic functionality of the mixer and how to use effects and route signals. While, we did look at a few recipes of using effects and the mixer, not much of what we did in the last chapter was applied to practical game development. Seeing how something works when it is applied to a real-world game development task or problem, reinforces a recipe or theory. Therefore, in this chapter, we will explore practical and advanced examples of how a mixer can be used.</p><p>For this chapter, we will spend time working through more practical and advanced examples that can be applied to a number of game development tasks. We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Recording audio changes with snapshots</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio Mixer scripting with parameters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dynamic audio wind effect</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating environmental audio zones</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dynamic music mixing</li></ul></div><p>Each of the main sections in this chapter will either be a practical example or provide an example of how to use the advanced capabilities of the Audio Mixer.</p><p>In order to complete the exercises in this chapter, you will need to have Unity installed on a computer, a downloaded copy of the book's source code, and the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> Unity example project installed. All the instructions for downloading and installing these resources are provided in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll continue from where we left off in the last chapter. As always, for those of you who have come here from another chapter, be sure that you have the Unity <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> project installed, and then import the <strong class="userinput"><code>Chapter_4_Start.unitypackage</code></strong> from the <code class="literal">Chapter_4_Assets</code> folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are unsure on how to install the project or load an assets, go back to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>, and work through the introduction.</p></div></div>
