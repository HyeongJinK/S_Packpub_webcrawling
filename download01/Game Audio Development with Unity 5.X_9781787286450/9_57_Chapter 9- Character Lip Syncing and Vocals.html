Traditionally, most character lip-syncing is rendered by animators to pre-recorded vocal tracks. While this works well and is still the method preferred by some, being able to dynamically lip sync a character reduces the need for animation entirely. Character lip syncing, on its own, is an advanced concept we could spent several chapters on. However, for our purposes, we are going to show just what is possible by extending the audio visualization techniques we developed in the last chapter and applying them to character lip syncing. Along the way we are going to get familiar with lip-syncing best practices and ultimately how these techniques can be applied to other environments, characters, or languages.
For this chapter, we going to extend the knowledge we have gained about audio visualization, with our goal being to provide real-time character lip syncing. Along the journey, we will need to understand some basics about speech and animation. Then, we will follow up with some techniques for character dialog and recording vocals. Here is a summary of the main topics we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Basic lip syncing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Speech and phonemes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Blend shape animation</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Real-time character lip sync</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Recording vocals

The previous chapter and this chapter include advanced topics that not all readers may be initially comfortable undertaking. Yet, we will try and address the content at a level all readers who have made it this far should be comfortable with.</p></div>
