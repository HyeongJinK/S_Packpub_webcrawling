We started with a basic introduction to the Audio Mixer, and how to set up mixers and groups. From there, we went on to introduce a few simple effects for equalizing frequencies and shaping our audio output. After that, we took a deeper look into mixers and groups and the Master group. This introduced us to other signal routing concepts with the Send and Receive effect, which introduced us to some more complex delay effects such as Reverb and Echo that worked best in a return group. We then spent more time reviewing all the effects the Audio Mixer supports and explored a couple examples with those effects. Finally, we focused our attention on the very useful Duck Volume effect.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will devote more time exploring further capabilities of the Audio Mixer. Here, you will learn about the use of: snapshots, parameters, and scripting the Audio Mixer, environmental effects and triggers, and interface controls.</p></div>
