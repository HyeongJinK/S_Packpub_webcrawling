In fact, a whole book could be written on just teaching basic music theory. The goal of this section is to teach you a few basics on music theory and some simple tricks to prototype music for your game or just fun. It is hoped that the knowledge of music composition will also assist you with working with sound designers or developing adaptive music for games. If you like composing your own music, you can certainly explore more learning resources online or locally.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note168"></a>Note</h3><p>For those of you with an already good understanding of music theory, you may still want to review this section as it will be relevant to the later sections in the chapter. However, remember that this section is intended for people with no knowledge of music theory.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="10lvl2sec28"></a>Chords and chord progressions</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span>chord</span> is a harmonic set of notes or pitches that sound as if they are <span>played</span> simultaneously. They are the root of tonal classic western music. This is the style of music now common in games and the one we will compose in. To keep things simple, we will just look at the major and minor triad chords, so named because they comprise of three notes. The following is a diagram showing an example of the major and minor triad chords:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f83203b9-f4af-4268-9646-95364280d80a.png" /></div><p>Example of Major and Minor chords in F</p><p>The diagram shows an example of a major and minor chords in <code class="literal">F</code>. We call it an <code class="literal">F</code> chord because our first note is <code class="literal">F</code>, as you can see in the diagram. From there, it is just a matter of counting. For a major chord, we count four notes (white and black keys) to the next note, an A. After that we count another three notes to the last note, a <code class="literal">C</code>. With minor chords, it is the opposite. Starting again with <code class="literal">F</code>, we count three notes to <code class="literal">G#</code> and then another four notes to <code class="literal">C</code>. In order to understand this better, how about we drop these two chords into a MIDI track by following the instructions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Reaper, and <span>from</span> the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New Project</code></strong> and when prompted to save the project select <strong class="userinput"><code>No</code></strong>.</li><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual instrument on new track</code></strong>. This will open the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX:</code></strong> dialog. Select and configure the sampler piano we used earlier or another VSTi piano or keyboard you may have downloaded. Close the dialog when you are done setting up the virtual instrument.</li><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New MIDI item</code></strong>. This will add an empty four bar MIDI item. Double-click within the MIDI item to open the MIDI editor.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Find the F key; somewhere around <strong class="userinput"><code>C4</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>C5</code></strong> is good. The F key is always the white key left of the grouped three black keys. Click on the key to list to the note. Then, use your mouse to draw the notes across the track to fill one bar (four notes at 1/16). Count four notes up from F and draw another set of four notes. Do this again, but this time count three notes up from the last note and again draw the notes. When you are done, your screen <span>should</span> resemble the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/6141fcb1-af69-4e97-9a84-8bcb9f6b53e6.png" /></div><p>Writing the F Major chord on the MIDI track</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Press the play button at the bottom of the window to play the track. When the track plays, it should sound harmonious; if it doesn't, then you may have done something wrong.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Now, we will repeat the process for the minor chord. Again, start at the <code class="literal">F</code> note just above the last chord, but this time start drawing notes after the first chord on the second bar. Then, just as before, start counting. Remember though a minor chord is three notes first and then four notes. After you have drawn the minor chord, your MIDI track should resemble the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/36e075fa-c1ea-4e8b-81c6-46e659b97b7d.png" /></div><p>Major and minor chords added to the MIDI track</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note169"></a>Note</h3><p>As a matter of convention, we will always refer to Major with a capital M and minor with a lowercase m. Thus, the shorthand form of F Major would be FM or often just shortened to F. For F minor, the shorthand form is Fm.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Again, play the track and listen to the two tracks together. If you only want to hear the minor chord, move the play head at the top of the timeline to the second bar just before the minor chord. When you are done listening, save your project so we can return to it later.</li></ol></div><p>One thing you may notice is that those two chords when played together sound harsh. Now assuming we don't want this harshness, how do we know which chords will work together and provide the basis for our theme? We will cover some basic chord progression tips and how they can be applied to themes in the next section.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="10lvl3sec3"></a>Chord progression</h4></div></div></div><p>Probably the first time you played with any musical <span>instrument</span>, you quickly realized that just mashing keys or notes just sounds awful. However, what you may not have realized is that there are actually some basic rules or theories we can use to make music. So far, we have covered the basic counting rules for constructing a major or minor chord. This method of counting not only extends to chords but also chord progressions and scales. We will cover scales later, but let's see how we can count the distance between two chords. The following diagram shows two chords, the key doesn't matter, and how we count the distance between chords:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/9f7b5520-0fdb-4028-8d3f-436ed742b512.png" /></div><p>Counting the distance between two Major chords</p><p>We count the distance between two chords from the root or the starting note of the chord. In the diagram, we start with <code class="literal">E</code> and then count the keys up from there to the next root of the second chord. Try counting the distance between the two chords on your own. Remember that counting starts on the next key, and we count all keys (black and white). Go back and count the keys between the last chords in the last exercise. Since we went from an <code class="literal">F</code> major to <code class="literal">F</code> minor, there will be 12 keys or one octave. In the preceding diagram, we use a form of shorthand to denote the chord type and distance (<code class="literal">M8M</code>).</p><p>Interestingly enough, some smart people have identified how the distance between chords relates to the theme of music in movies, television, and games. The following table shows chord progression distances that are common among the various themes:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Theme</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Chord Progression</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Shorthand</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Examples</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Protagonism</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Major 2 Major</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M2M</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Back to the future</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Outer space</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Major 6 Major</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M6M</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Star trek</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Fantastical</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Major 8 Major</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M8M</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Lord of the rings</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Sadness, loss</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Major 4 minor</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M4m</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Lost</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Romantic</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Major 5 minor</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M5m</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Stargate</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Wonder</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>minor 5 Major, Major 7 minor</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>m5M, M7m</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Night at the museum</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Dark mysterious</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>minor 2 Major</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>m2M</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Batman</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Dramatic</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>minor 11 Major</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>m11M</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Dark knight</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Antagonism</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>minor 6 minor, minor 8 minor</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>m6m, m8m</p></td><td style=""><p>The Empire strikes back</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In order to <span>demonstrate</span> this concept, we will extend the example we showed in the preceding diagram. As we can see from the diagram or counting the notes, the progression is M8M using our shorthand. Then, if we consult our preceding table, we will see that relates to a fantastical or fantasy theme. So, let's see how this sounds by drawing this on our MIDI track by following the directions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Reaper and go to the MIDI editor window. Right-click (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac) and drag the mouse around all the notes we previously drew. When you release the mouse, the notes will be selected and a context menu will appear. Select <strong class="userinput"><code>Delete</code></strong> from the menu to delete all the notes.</li><li>Locate the <strong class="userinput"><code>E</code></strong> key around <strong class="userinput"><code>C4</code></strong>. You can easily find <strong class="userinput"><code>E</code></strong> as it is the white key just to the right of the grouped two black keys. Draw the notes on <strong class="userinput"><code>E</code></strong> to fill a measure (four notes). Then, continue the process and count 4-3 to finish drawing the chord.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Right-click (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac) and drag select all the notes you just drew. From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Copy</code></strong> to copy the notes. Then, select the area just past the root note on the <strong class="userinput"><code>E</code></strong> chord, and from the menu select <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Past</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong>. You will now have a duplicate of the <strong class="userinput"><code>E</code></strong> chord as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/12f7a48f-055d-4a1f-98d7-fa36dba68733.png" /></div><p>Duplicating the Major chord</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Now, click to drag the selected notes, the second chord, up or down eight notes. Notice that you don't have to count keys, you can instead just count the grid lines. Since this chord is already a Major chord, no matter where we move it, up or down, it will always be Major.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip170"></a>Note</h3><p>Duplicating a chord and then just dragging it up or down is a great way to test various themes. At this point, you could quickly make any of the other chord progressions: M2M, M6M, or M8M.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>After you are done editing, play the track and listen. This sounds much more natural, but with only two measures, it is difficult to tell.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Select all the notes and copy them. Then, click in the area on the third measure and paste the notes. Adjust the chords so that they are inverted and look like the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a6c93062-4acf-4afd-9a48-29562736504f.png" /></div><p>Inverting the chords to fill the four bars of the measure</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>When you are done editing, play the tracks and listen to the composition. We can of course alter those chords any way we like, but follow along with the notes and chords we have chosen in this example for now.</li></ol></div><p>Now that we have some chords down, the next thing we generally will do is add a melody and this is what we will cover in the next section.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="10lvl2sec29"></a>Melody and scale</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span>melody</span> could best be described as the <span>interesting</span> or distinct part of a tune. While the chords establish the base notes and tone, a melody is what we often recognize a song for. Now, you probably are not going to compose a classic melody in your first session, but you will be surprised at what simple melodies you can create.</p><p>Before we jump into composing the melody, we need to understand a little about <span>what</span> a scale is. A <span>scale</span> is a set of notes or pitches that we know will sound good together. Now, there are many different forms of scales and how they are defined. For our purposes, we are going to use a classic form to derive the scale or notes we can use when constructing our melody. The following diagram shows how a diatonic scale is derived by counting whole and half tones:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/d0eb51ee-053d-45b1-84b5-b5825c8e7aa4.png" /></div><p>The C Major scale</p><p>The preceding diagram shows how you count out the notes for a <code class="literal">C Major Scale</code>. A <code class="literal">W</code> represents a whole tone or two notes and an <code class="literal">H</code> represents a semi-tone or single note. Looking at the diagram, you can see how we could just count out the notes of any major or minor chord. However, we are going to use an even simpler method to generate the notes for our scale. Of course, if you have some music theory under your belt and are comfortable finding all the notes on a scale, by all means use that.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip171"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">C Major Scale</code>, as you may have noticed in the diagram, is all the white keys. This can make composing simpler in C Major, but realize that at some point, you will likely want to introduce other scales to your music.</p></div><p>In order to demonstrate our simpler <span>scale</span> method and start writing <span>our</span> melody, follow the instructions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Reaper from where we left off in the exercise. Move the MIDI editor window down and out of the way but don't close it.</li><li>Hover your mouse over the left end of the MIDI chord track and it will change to the drag symbol. Hold the mouse down and drag the end of the MIDI item so that it is covers 12 measures as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/49037062-5e1a-4daa-80a8-a9bca1e8ea23.png" /></div><p>Extending the MIDI item</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note172"></a>Note</h3><p>You will notice that as you drag the MIDI clip over, it repeats the chords. This is because an automatic repeater has been added. If you open the MIDI editor for the chords, you will see a dark grey bar, denoting the repeat point has been added.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual instrument on new track</code></strong>. Use the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> dialog to select and configure the same instrument you used for the chords track above it.</li><li>From the menu, navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New MIDI item</code></strong> and then drag the item to fill the same area as the track above it. Double-click on the MIDI clip to open another instance of the editor window.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Do your best to overlay the melody MIDI window over top the chord window but to the right so you can see the first set of notes. Scroll the melody up to around <strong class="userinput"><code>C6</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>C7</code></strong> and try to match the keys (C to C), but the melody side should be at least an octave higher. Then, draw single notes that match the chord keys as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/4b8087ad-5bf3-46b3-9b07-31f02df49c8c.png" /></div><p>Placing the keys for the melody</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note173"></a>Note</h3><p>You will almost always want to create a melody that is higher in pitch. A higher pitch puts more focus on the melody.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>The three notes you drew will be our scale for the first chord. At this point, you can move those notes horizontally within the range of the first chord. Remember, you can't move the notes vertically as that would change the pitch and therefore the key. When you are done moving the notes, play the track and listen.
</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note174"></a>Note</h3><p>Using just three notes, we are obviously simplifying our songs. Yet, by only using three notes in each chord area we also force the use of space. Often, many beginning composers will want to fill every beat with a note, when it is better to compose some rest or space in your compositions. You certainly don't have to use all three notes and if you want you can optionally eliminate some.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each of the three remaining chords. Remember, you can only move the notes horizontally or 12 notes vertically (1 octave). As you add notes to your melody, keep playing the tracks and listen to the changes you are making. When you are happy with your melody, be sure to save the project.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note175"></a>Note</h3><p>Instead of trying to place notes randomly, when composing a melody, it is often helpful to have lyrics or an idea of the song's voice. If you are not a poet, just use a poem or other verse that fits the intent of what you are after. Then as you compose, sing the poem and place the notes where you want to highlight key phrases or emotions. Even though your song may not have vocals, you will likely be pleasantly surprised how well things come together.</p></div><p>If this is your first composition, don't worry about it sounding perfect. There will be plenty of time for improvement later. Just be satisfied that you have composed your first tune. In the next section, we are going to show you how to add some simple enhancements to the composition.</p></div></div>
