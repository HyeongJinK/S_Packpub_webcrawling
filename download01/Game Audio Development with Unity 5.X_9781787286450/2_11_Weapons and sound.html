For this section, we are going to introduce a new layer of audio, the direct feedback group. If you recall from the introduction in the first chapter, this is the layer of audio that covers sounds activated by a player action or reaction within the game, which may include audio such as explosions, weapons, character dialog, or boss music.</p><p>Back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>, we introduced the terms diegetic and non-diegetic. Are you able to categorize the audio we have used thus far or in the next examples as diegetic or non-diegetic? A quiz will be provided at the end of this section.</p><p>What better way to introduce direct feedback audio than by adding a weapon and the sounds associated with a weapon. For the example in this section and following with our theme of a <code class="literal">Viking village</code>, the weapon we will use is a throwing ax. Since we are basically constructing a projectile weapon, the same concepts could be easily applied to other games for weapons such as grenades, cannons, and knives.</p><p>Jump back into Unity and follow the instructions here to start the next exercise:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Make sure that you have the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> sample project from Unity loaded into the project you are using.

The reason we don't combine these sounds into a single audio clip is to allow us more control. This control of playback will be demonstrated in the next section.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>After you are done editing, press the play button.

When you are ready to stop playing, click on the play button to stop the scene.</li></ol></div><p>As you can hear, by <span>playing</span> the scene, those simple additions of sound provided an extra level of direct auditory feedback to the player. Now, the player not only sees the axe being thrown, but they can hear it as well. There is the sound of the throw, a swooshing noise, overlaid with a vocal grunt. We added the grunt in order to let the player know there was considerable effort used in throwing the ax. If we omit the vocal grunt sound, a player feels disconnected about the effort the character is making. Let's try this, open up Unity and follow the exercise here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Locate the <code class="literal">axController</code> object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window and select it.</li><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window, disable the second audio source (<code class="literal">grunt</code> audio clip) by unchecking the box beside the component name, as shown here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/98db5dbe-3255-406d-96c6-9e3066d68f84.png" /></div><p>Turning off the second Audio Source</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Press the play button to run the scene. Move around and throw several axs. Think about the mood or emotion you have toward the character as you throw the ax.</li><li>After you have played the scene for a while without the grunt sound, click on the checkbox on the second audio source to enable it again. Now, throw some more axs. Think again about how the connection to the character changes.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Next, expand the <span>second</span> audio source and lower the volume on the grunt audio clip, as shown here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/c4d50ceb-013d-41d1-b944-787704e8fc87.png" /></div><p>Changing the Audio Source volume</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Think about what effect changing the volume of the grunt sound has or says about the character. Does a louder or softer grunt sound say something about the physical condition of the character?</li><li>When you are done experimenting, press the play button again to stop the scene.</li></ol></div><p>Hopefully <span>the</span> preceding little exercise increased your appreciation for the subtlety of good sound design. We also started to introduce some other aspects of sound design known as adaptive sound. Adaptive sound and music is a dynamic way of altering game audio depending on the player's circumstances. Adaptive audio is prevalent in most games these days and a whole section of this book is devoted to it.</p><p>Of course, our scene is still missing the impact audio of the axe hitting things. Before we add those audio elements and since this chapter is about scripting, we will inspect the inner workings of the <code class="literal">axController</code> script in the next section.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="02lvl2sec17"></a>Understanding the axController script</h3></div></div></div><p>As you may <span>have</span> noticed, we avoided the tough work of manually entering the <code class="literal">axController</code> script. Instead, the script was provided as part of the chapter assets, not because the script is complicated, but because we wanted to focus on understanding audio rather than improving your typing skills. Although, we do still want to take the time to look over the script and understand the inner workings.</p><p>Open up Unity and follow the steps given to open the script in the editor:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Projec</code></strong>t window, and in the search field, type <code class="literal">axcontroller</code>.

Again we have a mix of <code class="literal">public</code> and <code class="literal">private</code> variables as shown here:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">public GameObject axPrefab; 
private AudioSource[] audioSources; </pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>The <code class="literal">public</code> variable <code class="literal">axPrefab</code> is used to hold the prefab we set as the thrown object. Remember how we set it by dragging the premade prefab into the open slot. Notice that it is of type GameObject, which means we could allow for almost any object to be thrown. Next, the <code class="literal">audioSources</code> variable is an array (denoted by <code class="literal">[]</code>) of audio sources. The <span>variable</span> is marked private, which means it will be set internally in the class.</li><li>The next section is the <code class="literal">Start</code> method. Remember the <code class="literal">Start</code> method is used to initialize variables and perform start-up tasks. True to form, inside the method the <code class="literal">audioSources</code> variable is initialized by calling <code class="literal">GetComponents</code>. It is just like the <code class="literal">GetComponent</code> method, but it returns all the components that match a type and not just one. Here is that line of code for review:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">audioSources = GetComponents&lt;AudioSource&gt;(); </pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>The last section of our script is the <code class="literal">Update</code> method, which, as we recall, is executed for every frame of the game. Here is the code inside the <code class="literal">Update</code> method:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) 
{ 
    foreach (var audioSource in audioSources) 
    { 
        if (audioSource.isPlaying) return; 
        audioSource.Play(); 
    } 
    var axe = Instantiate(axPrefab, 
        transform.position, Quaternion.LookRotation( 
        transform.forward,transform.up)); 
    var rigidBody = ax.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody&gt;(); 
    rigidBody.AddForce(transform.forward * 10f, ForceMode.Impulse); 
    rigidBody.AddTorque(transform.right * -10f, ForceMode.Impulse);  
} </pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>The first thing to notice about this code it is that is all controlled by the first <code class="literal">if</code> statement, which is used to determine if the mouse button is pressed. This is done using the <code class="literal">Input</code> object, which allows us to inspect the keyboard and mouse state. The statement <code class="literal">Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)</code> returns true/false depending on if the button is pressed. If the mouse button is pressed, then the code is executed inside the <code class="literal">if</code> statement. The next line of code starting with <code class="literal">foreach</code> is used to loop through <code class="literal">audioSources</code>, initialized earlier. The line: <code class="literal">foreach(var audioSource in audioSources)</code> is read as; for each audio source, we call a in <code class="literal">audioSources</code> do the following. Inside the <code class="literal">foreach</code>, the first statement determines if the audio source, <code class="literal">a</code>, is playing using the <code class="literal">isPlaying</code> property. If the audio source is playing, the return method is called, which exists of the entire <code class="literal">Update</code> method. This is done so that if an audio clip is playing, it can play to finish and to prevent rapid fire axe throwing. If the source is not playing we execute the next line, which uses the <code class="literal">Play</code> method to play the clip. This section of code will be executed for every audio source in the <code class="literal">audioSources</code> variable. The last part of code is the most complicated and is best left for readers wanting a broader discussion on using the Unity physics engine. Since our focus is primarily on audio scripting, just know that this section of code creates a new ax, with the <code class="literal">Instantiate</code> method, and then throws the object with the <code class="literal">AddForce</code> and <code class="literal">AddTorque</code> methods of the attached <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code>.</li><li>Notice that although we call some variables <code class="literal">axe</code> or <code class="literal">axePrefab</code>, this script could be used to throw any object.</li></ol></div><p>Now, we have added the audio to provide direct feedback to the player when they throw that heavy ax. Yet, we are still missing one last piece of audio in the scene and that is the sound of the axe hitting objects. In the next section, we will add the audio effects of the axe hitting or colliding with other scene objects.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="02lvl2sec18"></a>Playing sounds on collision</h3></div></div></div><p>As we mentioned, the last <span>missing</span> element of our scene so far is the sound the axe makes when it hits something. Now, this may seem like it could be quite complicated, and in fact it can be. For instance, you may want to have different objects sound different when getting hit or even perhaps break and make more noise. While that level of detail is entirely possible in Unity, it is a bit overkill for our simple audio demonstration. Instead, we are going to add audio effects to just the axe by following the exercise here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Enter the search text <code class="literal">axprefab</code> in the search field of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window.

Move around and of course throw those axs. Notice how the axe now makes a sound when it hits an object. When you are done testing, press play to stop the scene.</li></ol></div><p>Did you notice as you were running the scene how the axe sounds were obviously not only 3D but they matched well to how much force the axe hit or landed with? That is because we modified the playback of the audio depending on the force of the collision. Let's examine what is happening in the <code class="literal">axAudioCollider</code> script here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Locate the <code class="literal">axAudioCollider</code> script and open it in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window or your script editor. Either will work because we are only reviewing the script and not editing anything.</li><li>There is only one section of code we are interested in and that is shown here for review:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) 
{ 
if (collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude &gt; 2) 
   { 
       var magnitude = collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude; 
       var volume = Mathf.Clamp01(magnitude / volumeRatio); 
       var pitch = magnitude / pitchRatio; 
       audioSource.volume = volume; 
       audioSource.pitch = pitch; 
       audioSource.Play(); 
    } 
} </pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>The first thing <span>you</span> will likely notice is that our main working code is in a new method called <code class="literal">OnCollisionEnter</code> instead of <code class="literal">Update</code>. The reason for this is because we only want our code to run if an event, such as a collision, is triggered. While you can add this method to any object, it will only trigger when the object's collider collides with a different collider. A collider is a core element to the Unity physics engine and is generally used to prevent objects from passing through each other and/or detecting collisions. You can also have colliders that allow objects to pass through but still alert you of a collision. We will explore the use of such colliders later in this book. Inside the collision event method, the first <code class="literal">if</code> statement tests to see if the force or magnitude of the event is large enough to warrant playing a sound. This eliminates the potential for a lot of additional noise if an object rolls around for a while after landing or gets hung up. After, set some temporary variables to hold the magnitude of the collision and the calculated alteration in volume and pitch. We calculate a volume and pitch change using a simple ratio formula of the collision magnitude over a constant. This attenuation based on collision force is natural, after all, the more forceful collision, the louder it is. That technique, combined with already setting the audio to use 3D gives a more natural quality to the impact of the ax. Finally, we set the volume and pitch change based on the calculations and then play the sound.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">Mathf</code> static object is a library of useful math functions.
