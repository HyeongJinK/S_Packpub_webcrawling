As you have seen, assuming that you worked through those chapters, we were able to introduce a number of audio elements into our basic scene with good results. Chances are, if you were building a simple game a couple of years ago, those techniques would have worked well for most of your needs. In fact, that was the case for the majority of Unity developers. However, the game industry is always pushing the limits in the production value, with advances in graphics and audio. It seems with every new graphics enhancement, game audio needs to increase realism and immersion. In order to keep up with the current and mainstream, Unity introduced a fully integrated Audio Mixer in the release of 5.0. The capabilities and features of the Unity Audio Mixer will be our main focus for the next few chapters in this book.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to introduce the Audio Mixer, and elaborate on why it is such a game changer for audio development and how to convert our scene to use it. From there, we will look at the basics of grouping, signal routing, and various other audio affects we can apply with the mixer. Here are the main sections we will cover in the chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introducing the Unity Audio mixer</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Shaping audio with effects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The master mixer and controling signal flow</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Routing audio signals in the mixer to effects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The duck volume effect</li></ul></div><p>As with previous chapters, in order to complete the exercises in this chapter, you will need to have Unity installed on a computer, a downloaded copy of the book's source code, and the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> Unity example project installed. All the instructions for downloading and installing these resources are provided in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>.</p><p>We will start from where we left off in the last chapter. For those of you who have jumped to here from another chapter, first install the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> project and then import the <code class="literal">Chapter_2_Viking_Village_Start.unitypackage</code> from the <code class="literal">Chapter_2_Assets</code> folder. If you are unsure on how to install the required project or import an asset, then go back and start from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>.</p></div>
