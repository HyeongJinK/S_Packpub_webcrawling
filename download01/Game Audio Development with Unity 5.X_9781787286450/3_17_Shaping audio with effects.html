<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="03lvl1sec21"></a>Shaping audio with effects</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Thus far, we have used the <span>mixer</span> to group our audio <span>sources</span> into controllable groups or child mixers. This has allowed us to quickly balance the audio volume from various sources in our scene. While this is a great feature, it really is only the start of what is possible. The Audio Mixer not only allows you to mix or blend audio together, but you can apply numerous audio effects to each mix and even route the signal of a mix through other mixes. At this point, this may all sound a little abstract, so let's take a look at a simple hands-on example for adding audio effects:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Press play to run the scene. As the scene is running, switch your attention to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit in Play Mode</code></strong> button.</li><li>Isolate the mixer by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>S</code></strong> button at the bottom of the group, if you want to apply an effect to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer. Then, turn the volume up on the mixer so it is equal or greater than <strong class="userinput"><code>0</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/549eefa3-6b93-4379-928b-c258e6fe348a.png" /></div><p>Setting the Music mixer to Solo mode and increasing the volume</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note37"></a>Note</h3><p>The three buttons at the bottom of the mixer control the mode and are defined here: S = solo, only the single mixer is sent; M = mute, the mixer is muted; B = bypass, the mixer bypasses all audio effects</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Now that the Music <span>group</span> is the only channel playing, we will be <span>able</span> to easily hear the impact of any effects we add. Make sure to select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer group and then switch to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window.</li><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Effect</code></strong> button, and then from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/2ea17e52-f722-494d-bb4a-07e83c2584cc.png" /></div><p>Adding a Lowpass effect to the Music mixer</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Cutoff freq</code></strong> to a <span>value</span> around <code class="literal">2000</code> using the <span>slider</span> or text <span>entry</span> field, as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/276c8159-883d-4d49-8dc4-2f34dc8b8980.png" /></div><p>Setting the Lowpass effect cutoff frequency</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"></a>Note</h3><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong> effect or filter allow you to cut off sound above the threshold frequency. This can be useful for pulling out lower tones or softening an audio clip. It has also been used to great effect for quieting audio in pause menus or if a character experiences a temporary loss of hearing.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Notice how the sound of the music changes as you lower the cutoff frequency. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Effect</code></strong> button again and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> from the context menu. Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Cutoff freq</code></strong> to a value around <code class="literal">1500</code> using the slider or text field, as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/e23ef7bb-8b3a-43d3-8853-439423a12b52.png" /></div><p>Setting the cutoff frequency on the Highpass effect</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"></a>Note</h3><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> filter or effect is the opposite of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong>. The effect cuts off all the frequencies below the threshold frequency. This effect can be useful for cutting off lower tones and enhancing or isolating higher frequency sounds, such as bagpipes for instance. It can also be used to intensify or give an audio element an eerie screeching tone.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>The <span>first</span> thing you notice <span>when</span> you add the <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong><span>effect</span> is the music volume drops to being barely audible. This is because the default cutoff frequency of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> effect is cutting off those low tones before they even get to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong> effect. As the arrow on the preceding screenshot shows, all audio effects are applied top to bottom. In our example, the effects are added in the following order: <strong class="userinput"><code>Attenuation</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Low<span class="strong"><strong>pass</strong></span></code></strong>, and then <strong class="userinput"><code>High<span class="strong"><strong>pass</strong></span></code></strong>. When you lower the <strong class="userinput"><code>Low</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>pass</code></strong> cutoff frequency to around <code class="literal">2000</code>, this allows for only those lower frequencies to pass through to the next effect. Since the <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> effect; <strong class="userinput"><code>Cutoff</code></strong> is set to <code class="literal"><span>2000</span></code>, this allows a small band of around 500 Hz (1500-2000 Hz) of audio pass. If you listen to this, you will hear the music now sounds like it is playing from a can or a cheap speaker.
</li><li>Hover your mouse to the top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> effect; notice how the cursor changes to a vertical arrow. Click on the effect bar, and while holding the mouse, drag the effect above the <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong> and drop it into place. This will reorder the effects as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/de70aab1-61ed-4f54-9ea8-ebd33cc70586.png" /></div><p>Moving the Highpass effect above the Lowpass effect</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>Adjust the cutoff frequency of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Highpass</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Lowpass</code></strong> effects. Notice now, the combined effect sounds different with the order changed. When you are done testing, delete each of the effects by clicking on the gear icon and selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Remove this Effect</code></strong> from the context menu. Then, stop the scene.</li></ol></div><p>Now that we have explored how to add audio effects to a group and the importance of effect order, we will explore a more visual example of shaping audio in the next section.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="03lvl2sec20"></a>Visualizing audio equalization</h3></div></div></div><p>An excellent visual example of altering an <span>audio</span> signal is the parametric equalizer, which allows you to balance a range of tones visually. Follow the exercise to set up this effect:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>From the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button at the bottom of the <code class="literal">Music</code> group to open the effects context menu. Then, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> effect from the menu.</li><li>Set the parametric equalizer (<strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong>) settings to match those in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a502e4ee-08d0-4438-aef4-bef6133f2c85.png" /></div><p>Setting the parametric equalizer effect</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip40"></a>Note</h3><p>You can use the sliders, text fields, or select and drag the curve with your mouse to make changes to the ParamEQ effect.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Press play to run the scene. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit in Playmode</code></strong> button at the top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f2fef30a-ac5e-41ff-abd4-339a65a67d3b.png" /></div><p>Clicking on Edit in Playmode from the Inspector window</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>After the scene <span>starts</span> running, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>S</code></strong> button on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> group to solo that channel. The first thing you may notice about the music now is how the lower tones, especially the drums, are emphasized now. This exactly matches the center frequency we are applying to gain with the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> effect.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"></a>Note</h3><p>The frequency range shown in the diagram represents the typical human hearing range. Of course, if you were designing a game for dogs or elephants, you would likely use a much different range.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Try adjusting the parameters on the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> effect and notice how you can emphasize specific or broad ranges of the audio expressed in octaves. The following is a diagram showing the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> frequency graph over the top of the audible human frequency range and instrument chart:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/157e165d-d92a-4bc5-b7a1-d5fef183576f.png" /></div><p>overlaid on top of the audible frequency range chart</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"></a>Note</h3><p>The combination of the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> graph and audible frequency range chart should provide you with a good visualization of what ranges are affected by the equalization effect. For instance, if you wanted to highlight the high range of female vocals or other high pitched sounds such as the fiddle, you would shift the gain curve to the right, perhaps with a midpoint of 4,000 Hz and then a range of 1-2 octaves.</p><p>If you perform a search on Google images for <span class="strong"><strong>audible frequency range</strong></span>, you will find plenty of more examples of good charts showing more instruments or other sound ranges. Having a good instrument frequency chart handy can be a good reference if you are trying to tune music, highlight instrumentals, or tune other audio.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Adjust the <strong class="userinput"><code>ParamEQ</code></strong> parameters to equalize the <span>music</span> to your personal preference. When you are done editing, press the play <span>button</span> to stop the scene. Then, be sure to save the scene and project.</li></ol></div><p>If you do not have a <span>musical</span> background or audio editing experience, the preceding demonstration of visualizing the frequency range should be quite useful to you. Even if you do play a musical instrument, it may not be so obvious what frequency ranges another instrument or even a piece of music falls within.</p><p>As this section has demonstrated how a mixer group or channel can have effects layered to alter the frequency and corresponding sound, in the next section, we will look at how groups can by further mixed and routed to create even more complex audio effects.</p></div></div>
