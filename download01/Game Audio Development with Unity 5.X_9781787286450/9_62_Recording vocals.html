<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="09lvl1sec60"></a>Recording vocals</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>As much as we <span>now</span> have a real-time lip sync system running, you will of course still want to have in game characters lip sync vocal instructions to your players. In order to do that, we need the ability to record vocals or other sounds. How about instead of using different audio recording software we use Unity to record the audio directly. That way, we can also use this recording system to record sounds in a game just like those Foley artists do.
Open up Unity and follow the directions here to create a recording scene:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New Scene</code></strong>.</li><li>After the new scene is created, select from the menu <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Empty</code></strong> to create a new object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window. Rename this new object <code class="literal">Recorder</code> and make sure the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform Position</code></strong> is set to <code class="literal">0</code>.</li><li>Locate the <strong class="userinput"><code>MicrophoneRecorder</code></strong> script in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window and drag it onto the new <code class="literal">Recorder</code> object in <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window. This will automatically add a new <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Source</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Microphone Recorder</code></strong> components to the object.
</li></ol></div><p>Â </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Set the parameters on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Microphone Recorder</code></strong> component to those shown in the screenshot here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f067f0f5-16d0-499c-a47a-9058e6d15d35.png" /></div><p>Setting the Microphone Recorder parameters</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note157"></a>Note</h3><p>Setting those parameters allows for the recorded files to be saved and also trimmed of any leading or ending areas of silence. Trimming silence can be quite useful in recording and eliminates the need for you to do this later. As well, the Min Signal Threshold will allow you to block out background noise or any other noise distractions that can be common if you don't have a proper recording room. Of course, there are much better ways to record audio and we will look at one of those in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch10">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Composing Music</em></span>.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>When you are ready, run the scene. After the <span>scene</span> starts, you will see a <strong class="userinput"><code>Record</code></strong> button on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view. Click on the button to start recording and then press either the stop button to stop and save or stop and play the recording. The interface buttons are shown in the screenshot here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/4ab71849-d784-48b9-982b-b4088f689969.png" /></div><p>The button interface for the MicrophoneRecorder script</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>If you click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Stop and Play!</code></strong> button, the audio will not be recorded. So, be careful on which button you press. By clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Stop and Save!</code></strong> button, audio wav files will be saved to the <code class="literal">Assets/Vocals</code> folder. If you are unable to view any files in this folder, just right click on (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac) the folder and from the context menu select <strong class="userinput"><code>Refresh</code></strong> in order to force Unity to relist the folders contents.</li><li>When you are done recording the audio stop the scene. All the recordings will be in the <code class="literal">Assets<strong class="userinput"><code>/</code></strong>Vocals</code> folder or whatever you set it to. They will all be auto numbered. Just select any of the clips and you can play them from the preview panel at the bottom of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window.</li></ol></div><p>You now have the ability to record some quick vocals or other audio right within Unity. We won't spend anytime looking at the scripts that are used to do this since they are complicated and likely only of interest to the more developer focused reader anyway. Feel free to extend those recorder scripts for any other application and purpose you require.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note158"></a>Note</h3><p><strong class="userinput"><code>QUIZ TIME ANSWERS</code></strong>
