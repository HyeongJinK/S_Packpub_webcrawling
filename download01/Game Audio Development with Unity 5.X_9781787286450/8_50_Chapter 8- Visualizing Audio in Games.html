Essentially, all the audio we have used has been the result of some action, activity, or visual, from the sound of the wind, background music, axe throwing, and other sound effects. We have layered audio on top of the game's activity, in order to enhance the player's experience, which is the traditional use of audio in games. Although, wouldn't it be interesting if it was the other way around and the audio drove the games graphics and/or game play? Of course, there already is an entire genre and sub-genres of games devoted to music-driven gameplay, classified as music games. However, audio-driven game play and visualizations can be extended beyond that. What we will look at in this chapter, is how audio can be used to drive graphics visualizations and extended to derive game mechanics and game play.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to look at how audio can drive various graphic visualizations. We will look at the background techniques and tools Unity provides us to do this. From there, we will look at how a basic visualizer script can be built, after which we will use it in a couple examples. The following is the list of topics we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Analyzing audio with FFT windows</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Examining an audio visualizer</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Visualization performance and windowing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio-driven lighting</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Microphone-driven visuals</li></ul></div><p>This chapter will be primarily focused toward the developer and cover more advanced scripting techniques. Sound designers or audio engineers may find it helpful to review the contents in order to understand what is possible. While all readers should give this chapter a try, if you find yourself over your head, then be confident that you tried.</p><p>Unlike previous chapters, this chapter will start fresh with a blank new project. The examples in this chapter will assume that the reader has a solid understanding of Unity by this point. This means you should have either covered the introductory chapters or be well versed with Unity. In the next section, we will start with the foundations of how audio can be visualized within Unity.</p></div>
