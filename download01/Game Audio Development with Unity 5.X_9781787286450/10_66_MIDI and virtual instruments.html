While the standard was developed in the early days of computer-synthesized music, it really has become the interface for everything we do in modern music production. However, many people still confuse the use of MIDI to represent the digital representation of music, which it is not. Perhaps the simplest way to think of MIDI is as a complex form of music notation. In order to help demonstrate that concept, we will open up Reaper and <span>import</span> an MIDI song by following the instructions given here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open Reaper, and from the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New Project</code></strong>. This will clear out the workspace and reset any changes you may have made. If you are asked to save the current project, just click on <strong class="userinput"><code>No</code></strong>.</li><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Insert</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Media item</code></strong>. An <strong class="userinput"><code>Import file into project</code></strong> dialog will display. Use the dialog to navigate to the location you downloaded the book's source code and to the <code class="literal">Chapter_10_MIDI</code> folder. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Movie_Themes_-_The_Sting_-_The_Entertainer_by_Scott_Joplin.mid</code></strong> file and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Open</code></strong> to load the song.</li><li>An <strong class="userinput"><code>MIDI File Import</code></strong> dialog will prompt you to choose some options. Just confirm that both of the options are selected and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/3a9b2754-1cd2-4ecd-ab76-77dd0867c7ad.png" /></div><p>MIDI File Import dialog and options
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>After the MIDI file is imported, you will notice two new tracks have been added to the track area. These tracks look somewhat different than the audio wave files we are used to working with. The following is a screenshot showing how this will look in Reaper:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f5ddef3f-3fda-4e7c-8e7e-732721dcfc2c.png" /></div><p>MIDI tracks imported into Reaper</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note160"></a>Note</h3><p>The MIDI tracks are actually showing the musical notation or notes that will be played at any point in time. Looking at MIDI in this way, you can see that it is not unlike the old punch cards or rolls that were used in the old western player pianos. If you have ever watched the opening credits to the HBO drama Westworld, that analogy should be quite clear now.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Press play and listen. There is no sound. The reason for that is because we need to add a MIDI instrument to our tracks.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note161"></a>Note</h3><p>While we do have the musical notation defined, what we don't have is an instrument to play those notes, which, in our case, it might be a synthesizer or any virtual instrument. Now, that doesn't mean we need to have a MIDI keyboard or other MIDI instrument, as we can get using a virtual instrument instead.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Click on the small <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> button on the first track in the list; the button is highlighted in the previous screenshot. This will open a couple of dialogs. Select the Add FX to bring the dialog to the front. Then, select the Instruments group on the right panel and after that select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VSTi:ReaSamplOmatic5000(Cockos)</code></strong> instrument as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/54fb26d7-5932-46a5-bdf2-98ed7a76da95.png" /></div><p>Selecting the ReaSamplOmatic5000 instrument</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>After you select the instrument, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> button. The background <strong class="userinput"><code>FX:</code></strong> dialog will now take center stage with a confusing set of options. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Browse</code></strong> button and use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Open media file:</code></strong> dialog to locate the books downloaded source code <code class="literal">Chapter_10_Audio</code> folder. Select the <code class="literal">sting_piano_c6.wav</code> file and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Open</code></strong> to load the file. Then, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Freely configurable shifted</code></strong> option from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mode</code></strong> drop-down as shown in the following screenshot:
</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a0a707b7-ed4a-455f-beb2-dd05d8f1d5ac.png" /></div><p>Setting up the ReaSamplOmatic5000 instrument sampler</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note162"></a>Note</h3><p>The virtual instrument we are using here is called a Sampler. By setting the media file into the sampler, we are essentially telling it how one note sounds. The sample then creates the other notes as needed, very much like we did with our simple keyboard we built back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Audio</em></span>. You will learn more about virtual instruments later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Click on the start of the project home button at the far left of the control panel. This will move the play head to the beginning of the tracks. Then, press the play button to start the playing and listen/watch. As the play head scrolls across the tracks, you will see and hear the notes play.</li><li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the second track and just use the same settings for the sampler virtual instrument. After you are done, play the composition again. Now, you will hear both tracks playing a melody and chords, using the same instrument.</li><li>Double-click inside the MIDI area of the first track and this will open the MIDI editor window. Use the zoom in <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> button at the bottom right of the new window to zoom in to a few similar to the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/14385f21-1bdb-4318-9f2c-e13aac4abaf1.png" /></div><p>MIDI editor showing a piano roll view</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note163"></a>Note</h3><p>The default view for the MIDI editor is called the piano roll. The name piano roll is well suited because the notes look like cutouts in an old piano player roll. You can change the view by clicking on the various toolbar buttons. There is even a musical notation view on the end (musical staff) that can show you how the MIDI track would look on sheet music.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="11" type="1"><li>Use your mouse to click on the piano keys on the keyboard at the left, and you will hear each of the notes. From here, you can also add or edit the notes on the track. We will leave doing that until later. For now, just look through the menus and play some piano.</li></ol></div><p>To be clear, we have only just scratched the surface for what MIDI fully encompasses. However, the preceding exercise should provide you with a basis now for how we can use MIDI to compose sound or music. As you move through the software, you can also likely appreciate now how powerful and fully functional Reaper is. It may not be as slick as other packages, but for the price, it is remarkable. In the next section, we will cover another aspect of MIDI, the use of virtual instruments.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="10lvl2sec27"></a>Virtual instruments</h3></div></div></div><p>MIDI is a broad <span>standard</span> that covers many aspects for the interface of musical instruments with computers. The piano roll view of notes we looked at, in the end of the last section, could be thought of as a message from an instrument to a computer or vice versa. Yet, since the standard also covers the instrument interface for MIDI devices such as keyboards and synthesizers, it only follows that it could be extended to create effects and virtual instruments or VSTs. A VST or <span>virtual</span> studio technology is another way of describing an audio interface. The instrument we used in the last exercise is known as a sampler, because it creates notes from sampled media. The following is a list of the types of VSTs available:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>VST-FX</strong></span>: This group <span>covers</span> audio effects like reverb, echo, equalization, and so on. If you have been a consistent reader throughout the book, you should feel right at home using many of those effects by now.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>VST-MIDI</strong></span>: This is a type of <span>effect</span> that allows for the transpose and/or routing of <span>MIDI</span> to other instruments. It's not something we will worry about in this chapter.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>VSTi</strong></span>: This stands for <span>virtual</span> studio technology <span>instrument</span> or just virtual instrument. There are different types of virtual instruments described here:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Synthesizer</strong></span>: These create tones/notes <span>from</span> any sound generation technique. Synthesizers were very characteristic of MIDI music for the longest time. Now, they are as common as any other instrument.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Samplers</strong></span>: These sample a media file and then use that to generate tones/notes. An <span>extension</span> of this is called a ROMpler, which has predefined media already tuned to sound like a physical instrument. The ROM in <span>ROMpler</span> stands for read only memory, which just means these instruments are read only. We will explore some of these in the next exercise.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Drum machine</strong></span>: Similar to synthesizers, these <span>instrument</span> creates tones/notes that are specific to drum sounds.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>In most cases a VST will be a software plugin that is specific to the operating system. A windows VST will not work on a Mac for instance. There are a huge number of freely available VST plugins available for Windows but unfortunately Mac users will have less luck finding good plugins. This is because Apple's competing <span>protocol</span> Audio Units is often more preferred.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip164"></a>Note</h3><p>An excellent music composition tool called <span class="strong"><strong>GarageBand</strong></span> is freely available for the Mac. It uses the Audio Unit protocol to describe effects and virtual instruments. While the software won't have all the options of Reaper, it still may be a platform worth investigating for some Mac users, if you haven't already done so.</p></div><p>Open up Reaper again and we will take a look at how to set up and <span>install</span> a third-party VSTi ROMpler plugin by following the instructions:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note165"></a>Note</h3><p>The following exercise is specific to Windows installations so certain details may be different if you are a Mac user. However, the concepts should be the same on both platforms.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Options</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences</code></strong>. This will open up the <strong class="userinput"><code>REAPER Preferences</code></strong> dialog. Look on the left side of the dialog and select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VST</code></strong> group and you will see the following dialog:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/2b61e02e-7844-4239-9359-117c578a6cc8.png" /></div><p>Adding a VST plugins folder
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button, as shown highlighted in the screenshot, and use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Browse for Folder</code></strong> dialog to find the <code class="literal">Chapter_10_VST</code> folder in the book's downloaded source code. An example of how this will look on Windows is shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/572c5744-9225-4d3d-ae2e-082c7d8b3651.png" /></div><p>Selecting the VST folder that matches your OS platform</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note166"></a>Note</h3><p>If you plan to use Reaper extensively and will be downloading numerous plugins, then you should create a new VST folder on a drive with lots of space. VST folders have been known to grow into the 10's or 100's gigabyte range.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> after you set <span>the</span> folder. Then close the preferences dialog.</li><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> button on the top track to open the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX:</code></strong> dialog.</li><li>Then, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Remove</code></strong> button at the bottom left of the dialog to remove the sampler VST we previously configured.</li><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button and this will open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add VST to Track</code></strong> dialog. From the dialog menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Scan for new plugins</code></strong>. This will load the new plugins, or in this case, VST instrument. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VSTi:VSCO2 Piano (Bigcat)</code></strong> instrument from the instruments group and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong>. This will open the ROMpler settings panel. Stick with the defaults and then close both dialogs.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note167"></a>Note</h3><p>It is customary for most VST plugins to showcase a cool looking interface that may represent a hardware version of the device or something more abstract. In most cases, plugin interfaces will rarely share anything in common and you will often need to just fidget with the controls to see how things work.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Press the play button to play the audio and try to listen for how this virtual instrument sounds compared to the sampler we used earlier. If you pay attention to the high and low tones on the first track, you will notice that the new instrument plays much better. This is because ROMplers sample from a wider variety of preset media files and they have already been preset for the best experience.</li><li>When you are done listening, stop the audio. If you are still unsure of the difference in the way the instruments sound, repeat the previous exercise to load the sampler and play again.</li></ol></div><p>Windows users may have noticed that included in the book's source code is a whole collection of other ROMplers from DSK Music. Victor with DSK Music was gracious enough to provide us rights to distribute several of his excellent instruments. Each of the plugins from DSK actually contains, in most cases, numerous instruments. Here is an example screenshot from the <strong class="userinput"><code>DSK Overture</code></strong> ROMpler:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/42d97589-f91f-4a76-b384-5ffab0f210a0.png" /></div><p>DSK Overture showing it's orchestra of instruments
</p><p>There are literally thousands of VST instruments and effects out there freely available for download. However, not all VSTs are alike, and many can be unstable or just do not work right. So, finding the VSTs that work for you may take some time. Commercial VSTs are another option, but keep in mind these plugins are made for industry professionals. This means they will be at a premium cost but also better in quality.</p><p>Now that we have Reaper set up with virtual instruments and MIDI tracks, it is time for us to move onto some basic music theory in the next section.</p></div></div>
