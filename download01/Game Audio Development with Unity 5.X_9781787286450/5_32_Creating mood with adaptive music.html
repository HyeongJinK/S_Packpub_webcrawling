It is almost always the most influential non-diegetic audio element a director, editor, producer, or <span>game</span> developer will focus on in order to add depth and quality to their production. Music, therefore, has become an important production element in games for decades. In the early days of game development, developers found themselves using static or linear music tracks throughout their game to great success. However, as games became more sophisticated, linear music tracks just didn't cut it anymore. After all, unlike movies, games are not linear and ideally need gameplay to drive the tone of the music. It was with that realization of having gameplay drive the music and not the other way around, is what became adaptive music.</p><p>Okay, so now we decided that we want adaptive music for our game, and we have five levels or areas that need different music. Why don't we just go ahead and add those five different music tracks to our game and change them when a player enters a trigger. Unfortunately, it isn't that easy. After all, if we had five very different music tracks, it would sound painfully harsh to switch between them whenever a player moved to a new area of the level. Our audio needs to smoothly transition between tracks so as not to jar the players, experience. What sounded like a simple process of adaptively changing music, really is not that easy after all. In fact, it can be downright tricky from an audio or sound designers, perspective. Here is a list of the top current ways adaptive music has been implemented in games, with a general list of advantages and disadvantages of each method:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal re-sequencing</strong></span> : This is a <span>way</span> of blending those <span>multiple</span> tracks together using techniques such as cross-fading, phrase branching, musical demarcation branching, and/or bridge transitions.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Advantages:</strong></span><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Easier to compose and implement than other methods</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Allows for full changes to tempo, harmony, instrumentation, or melody</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></span>:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Often still very <span>disruptive</span> and still jarring to the player when a change occurs</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Changes are often non-immediate except for cross-fading</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio changes feel more scripted than adaptive
</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Stinger-based sequencing:</strong></span> This is a another <span>type</span> of horizontal re-sequencing that works by being triggered off events and then uses stingers (short audio clips) to cover <span>transition</span> points or changes in music.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Advantages:</strong></span><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Ability to transition quickly between full changes to tempo, harmony, instrumentation, or melody</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Highlights the music change by the game event</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Easier to implement and mix than other horizontal re-sequencing methods</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></span>:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Changes are <span>limited</span> to one event at a time</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Changes may appear to be disjointed</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Vertical remixing (layering)</strong></span>: The <span>music</span> is typically mixed on the fly into layers by adjusting tempo, harmony, instrumentation, or melody but while sharing common points of transition. Each transition may require multiple control inputs in order to adapt the music mix.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Advantages:</strong></span><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Allows for <span>very</span> quick and seamless transitions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Music changes are very natural</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Supports the ability to adapt after composition</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></span><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Difficult to <span>compose</span> for if not given the right tools</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Can be difficult to drastically change tempo and harmony on some compositions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The transition may be too quick and possibly missed</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li></ol></div><p>The following diagram demonstrates the difference between horizontal re-sequencing and vertical remixing visually. With the arrows representing possible audio changes or track transition points. Horizontal is appropriately named because changes may only occur horizontally on the audio timeline. While vertical allows for changes to occur anywhere on the timeline, since the tracks overlap by sharing common reference elements.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/5752ca0f-51e7-455c-8a28-69a96db0f5da.png" /></div><p>Diagram showing the difference between horizontal re-sequencing and vertical remixing techniques</p><p>The methods we will look at in this book will be number 2 and 3 from the preceding list. In the next section, we will get into implementing number 3, the vertical remixing (layering) system to use for our adaptive music with the Audio Mixer.</p></div>
