From the base of knowledge, we covered at a basic level how the technique of FFT and windowing could be used to process an audio signal into a visual representation of that audio. We then looked at the native support in Unity that allows us to break down an audio signal into bits we can generate visuals with. After that, we extended that example by adding more dramatic visualizations with lights. Breaking away from imported audio, we then looked at other sources of audio we could visualize, by adding support for using the microphone as a real-time audio source, where we discussed using a microphone or voice as a way to control a game.
In the next chapter, we are going to continue looking at vocals and dialog. This time we are going to create visualizations for vocals, where we will look at various sources for vocals and vocal dialog and how they can be used in gaming.</p></div>
