You learned that the order of effects on a group is important to how the audio is processed. This also applies to how audio is routed through the mixers. At the top of every mixer is always a Master. In order to simplify our understanding of mixers, we named our primary mixer asset <code class="literal">Master</code>.</p><p>However, this doesn't have to be the case and we will conduct an exercise to demonstrate this further:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Click on the plus icon beside the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixers</code></strong> element at the top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window. Rename this mixer <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> and then select it; your view should be similar to the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/5b814449-a05f-4c4a-9da6-1bfe6cdbcf58.png" /></div><p>Creating a new mixer asset called Music</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>This will create another mixer asset called <code class="literal">Music</code>. Note how the first group is called <strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong>. We can further confirm that this is a separate asset by going to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window and selecting the <code class="literal">Mixers</code> folder and expanding the mixer assets as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/2e4d4d13-e278-4e17-9367-bfa3a1dfba5e.png" /></div><p>Mixer assets in the Project-Assets-Mixers folder
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>As you can see, both assets have a <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong></span> group. The <code class="literal">Master</code> group will always be the top routing path for any mixer or mixer group. You can in fact route mixer assets through other mixer assets. Go back to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer and drag it onto the <strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong> mixer; this will make <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> a child of <strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/29d364a4-5ce0-4a1f-aaca-a8f602428be5.png" /></div><p>Routing the Music mixer into the Master mixer</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>A dialog titled <strong class="userinput"><code>Select Output Audio Mixer Group</code></strong> will then allow you to select the group you want to route the mixer asset through. Choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> group as shown in the preceding screenshot.</li><li>Now if you were to run the scene right now, nothing would change since the <code class="literal">viking_music</code><strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Source</code></strong> is still routing directly to the <code class="literal">Master-Music</code> group. Let's fix that by selecting the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer group and then clicking on the plus icon beside the <strong class="userinput"><code>Groups</code></strong> to create a new group. Rename that new group <strong class="userinput"><code>viking_music</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/518c8ad5-660f-4b6e-a9c8-f988e6233baa.png" /></div><p>Adding the viking_music group to the Music mixer</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Locate the <code class="literal">BackgroundMusic</code> object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window. Select the object, and then in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window, change the <code class="literal">viking_music</code><strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Source</code></strong> component's <strong class="userinput"><code>Output</code></strong> property to the new <code class="literal">viking_music</code> mixer group.</li><li>Press play now to run the scene. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit in Playmode</code></strong> button at the top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window. Notice how you are now able to switch between the top level <strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong> mixer and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer. Furthermore, you can control the music audio at multiple places as the signal is routed up to the top Master. Press the play button to the stop the scene when you are done exploring.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip43"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are new to Unity, it is recommended you go though the process of creating new mixer assets for the other primary groups we defined: Direct, Ambient, and Interface. Then, create individual groups for each audio source in each group, like we did for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> mixer and the <code class="literal">viking_music</code> audio source before. Finally, route all the new mixers as the children of the Master.</p><p>If you are an experienced Unity developer and don't have the time, the completed scene with those changes will be provided in the source code for the next chapter. Of course, if you are reading this book and want to become a Unity audio master, you probably want to complete the preceding exercise on your own, anyway.</p></div><p>From the last exercise, we demonstrated mixing across multiple mixer assets. This allowed us to group and identify our various audio source assets in each mixer more clearly. While this did provide for some organizational benefits, it is not the only type of additional audio signal routing we can perform with the Audio Mixer. In the next section, we will explore other forms of signal routing.</p></div>
