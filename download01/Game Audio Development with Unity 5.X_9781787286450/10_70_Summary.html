We started by downloading, installing, and configuring Reaper for basic use. After that, you learned about MIDI and how that could be used to allow us to compose our music. From there, we covered the use of virtual instruments within Reaper and how they would allow us add virtual sound to our MIDI tracks. With the background out of the way, we moved on to a very quick look at some music theory and simple composition rules we could use to build songs for our games. From there, we looked at adding a melody, bass line, and drum tracks. Then, we looked at how to render our songs to audio files. Finally, we covered the recording tools in Reaper and how you could clear up noisy sound.</p><p>In our next and final chapter, we will jump back into Unity and FMOD, where we will explore troubleshooting and performance tips.</p></div>
