We started with an introduction to adaptive audio, which is a way to adapt to, react with, and enhance gameplay. After that we looked at a technique for triggering adaptive audio and then implemented that into our village scene. From there, we took a closer look at adaptive music and the various techniques used to implement seamless music transitions. We then used one of those techniques best suited for the Unity Audio Mixer called vertical remixing to implement adaptive music within our demo scene. As we implemented this remixing technique, we began to understand the need for learning some basic music composition skills. Finally, in the last section of this chapter, we looked at adaptive sound using footstep audio. We introduced and examined a starting script that demonstrated how adaptive footstep sounds could be accomplished with a heavy amount of scripting.</p><p>For the next chapter, we will continue with the theme of implementing adaptive sound. However, in the next and following chapters, we will look at FMOD, which is powerful commercial tool that is able to do the job just as well as the Audio Mixer, if not better.</p></div>
