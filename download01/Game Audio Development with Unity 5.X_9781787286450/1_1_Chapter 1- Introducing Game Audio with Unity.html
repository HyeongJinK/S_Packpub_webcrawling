It is the leading cross-platform game engine that provides an abundance of features to make developing games easy. For this book, it doesn't matter if you are completely new to game audio, Unity, or game development. We will start with the assumption that you are a complete novice and build from there. With each new chapter, we will be introducing new concepts and additional material. Of course, if you are an experienced Unity developer with basic knowledge of audio development, you may want to skim over the first couple of chapters. Regardless of if you are a novice or master, the later chapters in this book will cover plenty of Unity features and tools to give you the knowledge of developing <span class="strong"><strong>AAA</strong></span> game quality audio for your games.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the basics of Unity and add audio to a project and scene in Unity. As this is the first chapter, we will be covering a quick introduction to game audio and then spend some time installing and configuring Unity. From there, we will introduce the core Unity components and how they function. Here is a summary of what we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to game audio</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Getting started with unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing audio into unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio sources and listeners</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">3D sound and spatial blending audio</li></ul></div><p>As with most of the chapters in this book, it is expected that you follow along and complete each of the exercises.

All the material required to complete the exercises will either be provided via the book's downloaded source code or will be freely available online. Therefore, in almost all cases, you will be required to have an internet connection.
