As we did before, we want to add a reverb or echo effect in order to provide that natural sound quality.</p><p>However, before we get into the <span>exercise</span> of doing that, it will be helpful for us to understand how the signal routing in FMOD works. If you recall, we already went over this for the mixer, so let's break down how this looks using the FMOD interface here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f8a47098-d66b-414a-9dda-a7e0220f3a82.png" /></div><p>Signal flow through the FMOD interface</p><p>The interface screen shows how the signal is routed through the event editor. This is just the first half of the routing and we will cover how signals are routed through the mixer later. For now, let's break down what each step is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sound file or Module -&gt; Audio track</strong></span>: The sound is first routed from the audio file or files called a module to the track. A track essentially represents a grouping of audio, and in the name group, is used to represent the same level.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Audio track -&gt; Master track</strong></span>: The audio track is routed to the master. Again, just like the way groups are routed to the master in Unity.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Master track -&gt; Input Bus</strong></span>: We will get to the bus routing later when we talk about the mixer. For now though, just realize that all tracks, including the master, route through an effects processor. In the screenshot, the effects shown are the <strong class="userinput"><code>Fader</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>3D Panner</code></strong>. Just like in Unity, effects can be added to any track (group) and routed to other tracks as well using a <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> effect.</li></ul></div><p>Now that we understand the first <span>phase</span> of routing, we will see how this can be applied by adding a reverb effect to our <code class="literal">torch</code> event by following the directions here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] on the track and from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Return Track</code></strong>. This will add a new track to the area. Double-click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>A</code></strong> label to rename the track <code class="literal">Reverb</code> as shown here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/8c32f11e-61c7-4c7b-a383-bf3db30a6bd6.png" /></div><p>Adding a Return track to the event</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>With the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> track selected, go to the deck area and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> button after the <strong class="userinput"><code>Fader</code></strong> effect. Then, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Effect</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>FMOD Reverb</code></strong> from the context menu. This will add a reverb effect to the track. Right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] inside the new effect and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Presets</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Mountains</code></strong>. This will add the effect as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/55d4275a-f9ef-4d0e-b26c-dc7a7c31ae6f.png" /></div><p>Setting a preset on the Reverb effect</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note103"></a>Note</h3><p>Notice that all the settings on the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> effect are very similar to the same effect in Unity. This is no accident since they ultimately use the same code base for both. However, look at all the preset options you have available to choose from. Ultimately, if you decide not to use FMOD, you can still borrow those preset settings and apply them to the SFX Reverb.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Select the <code class="literal">Audio 1</code> track <span>again</span> and return to the deck region. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> button again, and this time, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Send</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Reverb</code></strong> to add a Send effect. Set the send level to <code class="literal">0 dB</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/2e46e0ac-dbc8-4ccb-ae47-aee4bf963987.png" /></div><p>Adding a Send effect and setting the send level to the Reverb track</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip104"></a>Note</h3><p>This is the exact same workflow we used with the Audio Mixer in Unity to add the reverb and echo effects, so we won't explain the reason why we do this here. If you missed that section, head back to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Audio</em></span>, to review.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong> to update the project and jump over to Unity. Press the play button in Unity to run and test how the reverb effect sounds. Walk up to a torch and listen to the reverb. If there is too much reverb, go back to FMOD while the scene is running, and turn down the signal level.</li><li>When you are done testing and tweaking the audio, stop the scene and save your changes in FMOD.</li></ol></div><p>Hopefully, at this stage of our journey, you feel comfortable enough to add other regular or return effects to the audio tracks. You should be able to replicate the same steps and add a reverb return effect to the lake-shore -waves event as well. However, having to set the same reverb effect for each track could become tedious. So, let's look at a better way of doing this with the mixer by following the instructions here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>First, remove the existing reverb return effect by right-clicking [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] on the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> track and selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Delete</code></strong> from the context menu. Then, select the <code class="literal">Audio 1</code> track and in the deck region, right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> effect and from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Delete</code></strong>.</li><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixer</code></strong>. This will open up the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixer</code></strong> window, and you will see both of the events in the routing list, plus a default reverb. Upon first opening this window, you will notice it is quite similar to the Audio Mixer, again not by accident.
</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note105"></a>Note</h3><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixer</code></strong> window allows you to define the Input buses that will be mixed like groups in Unity and will all get routed to the Master bus. This may be slightly confusing at first, but this is just like how we created child groups that routed to groups in Unity.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] on the <code class="literal">torch</code> event, and from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Reroute to New Group</code></strong>. Rename the new group <code class="literal">Ambient</code> and then drag the <code class="literal">lake-shore-waves2</code> event into the same group as shown in the <span>following</span> screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/3770b41b-e439-4c62-bda1-53e46cdf30db.png" /></div><p>Transferring the lake-shore-waves2 event to route through the Ambient group</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Select the <code class="literal">Ambient</code> group, and then in the deck area, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> button and from the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Send</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Reverb</code></strong>. Then, adjust the send level to <code class="literal">0 dB</code>, just as you did in the last exercise.</li><li>Select the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> group, and then in the deck area, right-click on an empty space on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Reverb</code></strong> effect to open the context menu. From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Presets</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Mountains</code></strong>. Here is a screenshot showing the completed window:

Press play in Unity to run the scene. Again, feel free to return to FMOD and adjust the mix as you would have done in Unity. When you are done editing and testing, stop the scene and save your changes.
