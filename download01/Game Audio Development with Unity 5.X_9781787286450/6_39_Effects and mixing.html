Fortunately for us, while the interface may be quite different, the theory and practice we already covered in previous chapters will apply well here. In order to demonstrate effects and mixing, we will add the lake shore waves ambient sound we used previously, as a new event in Unity, by following the directions here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up the FMOD event editor window to the <code class="literal">GameAudio_FMOD</code> project. The one we have been working with.
</li><li>Locate the <code class="literal">lake-shore-waves2.wav</code> audio clip in the <code class="literal">Chapter_1_Audio</code> folder of the book's downloaded source code. Drag this file from the folder and drop it into the event editor <strong class="userinput"><code>Events</code></strong> tab as shown in the screenshot here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/5cb67689-5e52-4b24-84a7-c960f060c500.png" /></div><p>Importing the lake-shore-waves2.wav file into the FMOD event editor</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>You will then be prompted by the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Event</code></strong> dialog to select the type of event, choose <strong class="userinput"><code>3D</code></strong> as we did earlier, and then click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong>. Right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac] on <span>the</span> and then from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Assign To</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Master Bank</code></strong>.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note100"></a>Note</h3><p>In order to avoid confusion, we will call the work areas within FMOD Studio region or area as opposed to windows like we do in Unity. This is because FMOD actually creates and uses actual windows for various functionality such as mixing, event editing, and so on.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Right-click [<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + Click on Mac] on the audio clip in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tracks</code></strong> region, and from the context menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>New Loop Region,</code></strong> just as we did for the <code class="literal">torch</code> event earlier.</li><li>Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Master</code></strong> track in order to <span>view</span> the event's <strong class="userinput"><code>3D Panner</code></strong> effect and adjust the settings to match those shown in the screenshot here:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/36c30d51-eca2-4812-9399-f1db166d1304.png" /></div><p>Adjusting the 3D Panner effect on the lake-shore-waves2 event</p><p>Notice that as you change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sound Size</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Min Extent</code></strong> (angle) on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Panner</code></strong> the way the 3D preview plot updates. This not only allows us to control how the sound drops off but how wide and deep the sound is. Creating that depth is essential for us on our lake waves sound. Otherwise, we would need to place multiple sounds in our scene to generate the same effect.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip101"></a>Note</h3><p>We don't have the time to break down all the FMOD effects like we did for the Audio Mixer, but it will be invaluable to you to spend time playing with each effect at some point.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong> to build the project. This will also update the connect project in Unity as well. Next, open up the Unity editor and locate the <code class="literal">Capsule 5</code> object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window. Rename the object to <code class="literal">Ambient_lake-shore-waves</code> and set its <strong class="userinput"><code>Z</code></strong> position to <code class="literal">60</code><span class="strong"><strong>,</strong></span> just like we did in the first chapter.</li><li>Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong> and then locate and add an <strong class="userinput"><code>FMOD Studio Event Emitter</code></strong> component to the object. Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play Event</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Object Start</code></strong> and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Event</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>event/lake-shore-waves2</code></strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/1177c7d3-b90e-44ff-8291-cd54bddc5f97.png" /></div><p>Setting the Studio Event Emitter properties
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Press play to run the scene. Move around and listen to the sounds of the torch and the waves. Obviously, one of the more powerful features of the Audio Mixer is to be able to edit while the scene is running. Fortunately, you can also do this in FMOD. While the scene continues to run, go back to FMOD, and from the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Connect to Game</code></strong>. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Connect to Game</code></strong> dialog will open, prompting you to select the host, just use the defaults as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/70248d74-ad1d-40b5-8903-cce8f9d4663a.png" /></div><p>FMOD Studio connecting to Unity</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>After FMOD connects to Unity, you can now edit your events in real time and notice the changes automatically just like the mixer. Unlike Unity, however, you have full control over all the audio effects, including control of the <strong class="userinput"><code>3D Panner</code></strong> in one interface. This is a very powerful feature, but you may find it distracting moving between interfaces unless you have two+ monitors.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip102"></a>Note</h3><p>FMOD Studio is designed to be used with multiple monitors. Everything is still completely functional, if you only have a single monitor. When it comes down to it, you will be more productive with multiple monitors if you are doing a lot of fine edits.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="10" type="1"><li>Go ahead and continue <span>exploring</span> and making edits. When you are done, stop the scene and save your changes in Unity and FMOD.</li></ol></div><p>Now that we have our couple of starter ambient sounds, we can look to add some effects to give them a little more quality and realism, just as we did previously. Of course, we won't cover all the techniques and effects we used earlier, but instead will go through a couple effects workflows in the next section.</p></div>
