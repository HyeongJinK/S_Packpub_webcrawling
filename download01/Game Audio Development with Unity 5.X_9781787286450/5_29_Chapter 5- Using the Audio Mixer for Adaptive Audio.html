Starting from the basics of looped ambient audio clips to something a little more advanced using 3D spatial techniques. From there, we introduced processing and mixing techniques in order to refine the sound and music the game played. Then, we jumped into advanced mixing techniques in order to develop some dynamic audio effects with the wind and the environment. While all the techniques we have covered thus far could create excellent audio for your game, in this chapter, we start to bump things up to the next level by introducing adaptive audio.</p><p>For this chapter, we introduce new audio techniques in gaming called adaptive audio. Then, of course, as always, we will use these new concepts and apply them to useful and universal examples. Here are the main topics we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introducing adaptive audio</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building adaptive audio cues</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating mood with adaptive music</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Vertical remixing with the audio mixer</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Footsteps with adaptive sound</li></ul></div><p>The examples in this chapter will continue from the work we completed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Audio Mixing</em></span>. For those of you that have jumped here from another part in the book, you can get going by installing the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> Unity project and then importing the <code class="literal">Chapter_5_Start.unitypackage</code> found in the downloaded source code in the <code class="literal">Chapter_5_Assets</code> folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip75"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are unsure on how to install a project or import custom Unity assets, then in order to get the best experience from this book, go back and cover the exercises in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Game Audio with Unity</em></span>, first.</p></div></div>
