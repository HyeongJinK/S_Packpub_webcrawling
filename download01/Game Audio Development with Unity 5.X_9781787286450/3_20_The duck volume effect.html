This is a powerful effect and has many applications in several areas where we want to highlight a specific group without it getting washed out from other competing audio. As this is a specialized effect, we will take a look at the following custom configuration to set this effect up:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Unity to the village project and direct your attention to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window. Select the <code class="literal">Music</code> group and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Effect</code></strong> button. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Duck Volume</code></strong> effect from the context menu.</li><li>Select the <code class="literal">Direct</code> group and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Effect</code></strong> button to open the effect context menu. Then, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> effect. Drag the new <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> effect above the existing <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> and then set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Receive</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>'Music\Duck Volume'</code></strong> and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Send level</code></strong> right up to <code class="literal">0</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/1e306809-05c9-4977-b47a-057bce4c58d3.png" /></div><p>Setting up the Send to the Duck Volume effect</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note54"></a>Note</h3><p>The Send to a Duck Volume effect does not increase the output gain of the group as the signal is only used to trigger the effect. In our example, we moved the Send up a level in order to avoid any confusion. However, if you do notice the effect not being triggered, try moving the Send up or down in the chain. This may just be an issue in the way Unity updates in the play mode.</p></div><p>Â </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Select the <code class="literal">Music</code> group and <span>then</span> set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Duck Volume</code></strong> settings as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/1810141a-0bcc-4aa1-b60b-87e464cf6f57.png" /></div><p>Setting the Duck Volume effect parameters</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Let's take a closer look at what these settings mean and how they are used:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span>: This is the required signal level (loudness) before this effect will be triggered. In our example, we set this to <code class="literal">-60 dB</code> in order to catch the fainter axe-landing sounds.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Ratio</strong></span>: This determines the amount of reduction in gain or change in the volume. We use a value of <code class="literal">200%</code> in our example since it works well for our short-lived Direct audio.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Attack time</strong></span>: This sets the amount of time between when the threshold is triggered and the reduction in gain starts. A value of <code class="literal">10 ms</code> is used here to allow for a quick attack, since the audio group we are ducking on has a short-lived audio.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Release tme</strong></span>: This is the amount of time after the attack time has passed before the gain reduction is reset to the original. Again, we set this to a short release of <code class="literal">10 ms</code> because the grunt, throw, and landing sounds are short lived.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Make-up gain</strong></span>: Use this parameter to alter the gain, positive or negative. We are keeping this value at <code class="literal">0 dB</code> in the example, since we don't want to alter the audio aside from the duck effect.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Knee</strong></span>: This determines the behavior of when the effect is triggered. A low value will create a hard or linear transition, while a larger value will soften the transition. We will start by using the default value of <code class="literal">10 dB</code> and then later in our sample alter this value to demonstrate the impact of this effect.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sidechain mix</strong></span>: This determines the amount of wet and dry audio mix. At 0%, only the original or dry signal is heard. While at <code class="literal">100%</code>, only the modified or wet signal is heard. We use a value of <code class="literal">100%</code> as the default, because we want the <strong class="userinput"><code>Duck Volume</code></strong> effect to completely control the volume of the <code class="literal">Music</code> group.</li></ul></div></li><li>Press play to start the <span>scene</span> and then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit in Playmode</code></strong>. Listen to the scene and throw an axe or three. Notice how the <strong class="userinput"><code>Direct</code></strong> group of sounds now is not obscured by the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> group anymore. However, you may hear a pause or click when the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> group volume adjusts or is ducked.</li><li>In order to fix this issue, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Music</code></strong> group and direct your attention to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window's view of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Duck Volume</code></strong> effect. Adjust the <strong class="userinput"><code>Knee</code></strong> setting on the effect to the maximum right as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/0c48d304-452a-4cea-9068-015f9a99c2e5.png" /></div><p>Adjusting the Knee on the Duck Volume effect
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Notice how the graph smooths to a very gradual curve now. There is no longer a hard edge or change at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Threshold</code></strong> line on the graph. Go back to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view and throw a few more axes. Now, the volume change should almost be imperceptible.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip55"></a>Note</h3><p>You can also modify the various effect settings by clicking and dragging on the graph.
