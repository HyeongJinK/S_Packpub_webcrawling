Of course, if you haven't taken a break, good for you, and just continue as you were.</li><li>Now, divert your attention to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window and specifically the search field at the top of the window. Click on the down arrow at the left of the search field, to select the form of the search as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/eb311c85-1ad0-4136-b097-b1147697fe37.png" /></div><p>Setting the search type</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Now, enter <code class="literal">AudioListener</code>; make sure to use the same case in the search field. This will filter the GameObject in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window with an AudioListener component attached, as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/b2ce2514-8f3a-45bf-9094-9235fe804963.png" /></div><p>Hierarchy window showing filtered list of game objects with AudioListener</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>As you can see, this filtered list of objects is showing us the various scene cameras. A camera in Unity is what captures the rendered view of the scene. As such, you can think of a camera as the player's eyes to the game world. Therefore, it only makes sense that we also make the camera be able to listen to the world using the AudioListener component. That way, as the <span>camera</span> moves around the scene, the ears or Audio Listener, will also be tightly coupled.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>A GameObject in Unity is the base scene object. What differentiates one object from another is the components attached to the GameObject. A component is a script that applies specialized functionality to a GameObject. A component could include everything from a camera, audio listener, audio source, mesh renderer, and so much more. The Inspector window allows you to view, modify, add, and remove components on a GameObject.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Select <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera_high</code></strong> at the top of the list in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window and take a look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window and bottom-right corner of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/55dc1cc2-1e42-4183-8938-ed717de06a4b.png" /></div><p>Camera preview and Inspector window
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>As you can see, there are a number of components attached to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera_high</code></strong> object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window. We won't get into the details of all the components but just take notice of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Listener</code></strong>. Remember that these two components equate to the scene's eyes and ears. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera_high</code></strong> object selected and press the <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> button to run the scene.</li><li>After the scene starts running and switches to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Esc</em></span> key to unlock the mouse. Then, go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window and scroll through the components. Feel free to turn off and on components by unchecking the checkbox beside the component name. You can even alter the component settings if you like. Notice how the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view changes as you make those changes. Don't be afraid to change several things; as long as you are in play mode, nothing will be saved.</li><li>When you are done with exploring the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window, press the Play button again to stop the game running.</li></ol></div><p>Good. As you can see, we already have a number of Audio Listener components set up on the scene. This means that we can certainly hear any audio. However, we are still missing the source of our audio, which hasn't been configured. In the next section, we will add an Audio Source component to our scene.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="01lvl2sec13"></a>Adding an audio source</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to hear any <span>audio</span> in a scene, we need two components added to game objects. They are the Audio Listener - the ears, and the Audio Source - the noise. As you probably already realized, the dead silence of our scene must mean there are no configured Audio Sources. In the following exercise, we are going to rectify that issue by adding an Audio Source:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open the Unity editor and make sure the <code class="literal">Viking Village</code> scene is loaded. If you are continuing from the last section, be sure to click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>X</code></strong> on the right side of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window search field. This will remove the type filter and show all the scene objects again.</li><li>Locate the GameObject called <strong class="userinput"><code>AccessibleVolume</code></strong> in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window and click on the arrow beside it to expand and show its child objects. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Capsule 5</code></strong> object and press <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span></em></span>, to frame select the object as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/76ab36e6-ee38-432f-8153-d74ab1af65b7.png" /></div><p>Frame selecting the Capsule 5 GameObject</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>What we <span>want</span> to do is use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Capsule 5</code></strong> object as an Audio Source for our <code class="literal">lake-shore-waves</code> ambient sound we imported earlier. We will use this object as it is conveniently situated close to where we want our Audio Source. Before adding the audio though, let's make a couple changes to the capsule.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>We are going to add the audio to the scene following the audio layers and groups we defined earlier. Therefore, the first layer we will be adding the audio to is for the ambient and environmental background noises.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>With the capsule object still selected, rename the object <code class="literal">Ambient_lake-shore-waves</code> and then set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Z</code></strong> position on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> component to <code class="literal">60</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/2b3e62bf-7f86-4791-b79b-6796fae53970.png" /></div><p>Renaming and altering the position of the Capsule 5 GameObject</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"></a>Note</h3><p>Giving your game objects an appropriate name is essential, especially as your scene becomes more complex. Notice how we prefixed the object name with our layer name and then followed that with the audio clip name.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>After you changed the <strong class="userinput"><code>Z</code></strong> position of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform,</code></strong> you will notice that the object moves to shore of the lake in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view. This is exactly what we want, as this capsule object will be the source for the lake-shore-waves ambient sound.</li><li>Next, click on the button <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong> button at the bottom of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window. Type <code class="literal">audio</code> in the search text and notice how the list filters to components with audio in the name. Select the <span>Audio Listener</span> component as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/1a449203-70b7-4708-9df6-9d9a93b7dbf6.png" /></div><p>Adding the Audio Source component
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>We now <span>have</span> an empty <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Source</code></strong> component on our object. Click on the target icon located next to the <strong class="userinput"><code>AudioClip</code></strong> property. This will open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Select AudioClip</code></strong> dialog. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>lake-shore-waves2</code></strong> clip from the list as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/f59d1505-be27-4ca6-90ff-23d73c1694f5.png" /></div><p>Setting the AudioClip on the component</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Close the dialog after selecting the clip. We won't worry about all the other settings on the component right now. However, we do want to make sure the clip loops, since, after all, it is ambient sound that should keep playing over and over again. Click on the <span>checkbox</span> next to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Loop</code></strong> setting to make sure the <span>audio</span> loops.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"></a>Note</h3><p>Audio clips will typically be designed to either play forever, called a loop, or play just once, called a single shot. In most cases, you will want your ambient sounds to loop, but not always. Whereas, audio-like weapons or footsteps will generally be a single shot. A looping audio clip is one that is designed to play over and over again with no noticeable break or change when the clip plays over.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>With the Audio Source is added to the scene, press the Play button. Explore the scene by moving around and listening to the audio as you move. When you are done exploring, press Ctrl+P (<span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + P on Mac) to stop the scene running.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="10" type="1"><li>Select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Save Scene</code></strong> from the menu, to save the changes we made to the scene. It is a good habit to save your scene often in Unity and especially when you are working with large scenes.</li></ol></div><p>Good, we now have an ambient Audio Source in our scene. Of course, most likely, the first thing you noticed is that the sound was everywhere and that certainly is not what we want. We obviously only want our waves sound to be more audible when we get closer to the lake and certainly not so pronounced everywhere. What we need is to make our Audio Source use 3D or spatial sound and this is exactly what we will cover in the next section.</p></div></div>
