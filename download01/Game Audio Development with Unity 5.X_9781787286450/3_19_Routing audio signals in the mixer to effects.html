<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="03lvl1sec23"></a>Routing audio signals in the mixer to effects</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>You have most likely already have <span>seen</span> the <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Receive</code></strong> effects listed on the effects context menu in one of the previous exercises. While they are considered effects, they really are a way of routing a group signal to another group for additional processing. This allows us to split and combine multiple signals through the same group or multiple groups for additional effects processing. The following is a diagram showing how this may work and a sample of the type of effects that use multiple signal processing:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/4e1662ac-92b5-47a9-b673-b09d904b5279.png" /></div><p>Mixer signal routing through return effects groups</p><p>The preceding diagram represents the routing we will connect in the next exercise. For simplicity, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Interface</code></strong> mixer group, which is just a placeholder for now, was removed. As the diagram shows, the <code class="literal">Direct</code> and <code class="literal">Ambient</code> groups will have their signal split to the <code class="literal">Master</code> and either a <code class="literal">Reverb</code> or <code class="literal">Echo</code> return effect. In turn, the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> and <code class="literal">Echo</code> effect after processing the signal will route to the <code class="literal">Master</code>. Finally, the <code class="literal">Master</code> will combine all the groups and send the signal to the audio listener in the scene.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"></a>Note</h3><p>When a signal is split, the output from the original group is not cut or reduced. Instead, the portion of the signal that is split is added to the original by an amount set by the send level.</p></div><p>In the example, we <span>are</span> using the <code class="literal">Reverb</code> and <code class="literal">Echo</code> as return effects. We call them return effects to denote that they are processing a return or split signal. By doing this split and routing the signal back to another group or groups, it allows us to enhance or layer additional dynamics or physical characteristics about a sound we couldn't do otherwise. For instance, if we wanted to simulate a real-world sound we would want to create an echo or reverb to our audio mix. However, we wouldn't want all our audio processed through the same effect. This would make our audio sound over processed; instead we would want to simulate the actual and reflected sounds in multiple channels, just as we would experience them in the real world.</p><p>Check out the following diagram, which demonstrates how sound travels in the real world:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a9d16605-d22a-4627-970e-9dfc2f5b4654.png" /></div><p>Direct, diffuse, absorbed, and reflected sounds</p><p>As you can see in the diagram, sound can appear from multiple sources and at slightly different times to the listener. If you have ever stood in a large empty room or cavern, you will hear this effect magnified. With the sound seeming to echo on and on as it is reflected off the walls or other surfaces. Both the SFX Reverb and Echo effects simulate those various physical effects, such as sound reflection and diffusion. This is why, for both effects, we will generally process them through a signal return, in order to add that additional echo or reverb effect on top of the original audio.</p><p>Let's put all this sound physics <span>theory</span> to practice by adding a Reverb and Echo effect to our mixer by following the exercise:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up the village scene in Unity and make sure the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window is visible.

Yet, if you have followed along with the exercises, most of what we just did should seem almost natural and intuitive by now. Of course, at this point, it should be obvious that we are only scratching the surface of what is possible with signal routing and effect mixing in the Audio Mixer. In the next section, we will breakdown the other audio effects for your reference.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="03lvl2sec21"></a>Audio effects breakdown</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have never mixed <span>audio</span> before, all these different effects can be overwhelming and abstract on how or where to use them. In this section, we are going to review each of the effects at a basic level, what they do, and a typical application for each. We won't go into extensive details on the effect parameters as they are well documented in other areas. For some of those effects that may have a direct benefit to our scene, we will provide an example. Of course, as always, take some time to test all of these effects on your own to get a better understanding of how they work.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="03lvl3sec0"></a>Equalization effects</h4></div></div></div><p>Equalization effects <span>are</span> used to alter the frequency response of an audio signal. As we have seen in the musical keyboard demonstration from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Audio</em></span>, the higher the frequency equates to a higher octave, pitch, or tone. Conversely, the lower the frequency, the lower the octave, note, or tone.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec0"></a>Lowpass and Lowpass simple</h5></div></div></div><p>We have already spent time <span>looking</span> at the Lowpass effect. Just remember that the Low in Lowpass means it allows frequencies lower than the cutoff. So if you wanted to emphasize low tones, such as a kick drum, you would use a Lowpass effect.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec1"></a>Highpass and Highpass simple</h5></div></div></div><p>As we have seen, a <span>Highpass</span> effect allows for those upper frequencies above the cutoff to pass through and is effectively the opposite of the Lowpass effect.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec2"></a>ParamEQ</h5></div></div></div><p>Since we have already spent a <span>fair</span> bit of time on this effect, we will just mention it here. This effect is used to isolate a frequency range and then either increase or decrease the signal strength. This is useful to isolate or highlight certain instruments or vocals in a mix.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="03lvl3sec1"></a>Delay effects</h4></div></div></div><p>A delay effect stores and <span>then</span> plays back or echoes the original signal back onto itself. The effect originated for the need to spatialize or create the sense of space in audio playback. We generally equate a sound with an added delay or echo as being in a large space. Since this is something we already covered when we looked at <strong class="userinput"><code>SFX Reverb</code></strong>, we don't need to elaborate much further. However, delay effects have had a broad use in other areas of mixing, especially in modern music, so don't think a delay effect can't be used for some other cool sound.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec3"></a>Echo</h5></div></div></div><p>You can <span>think</span> of the <span>Echo</span> effect as the base delay effect. The effect creates an echo by playing the input signal delayed over a period of time. This is a good effect, if you want to create a sense of space to your audio without using one of the more CPU intensive delay effects. Since this effect is the base for the other delay effects, let's take a closer look at the parameters in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/a189e6b8-3f8b-48bf-a4ed-34dfa7ed664a.png" /></div><p>Echo effect default settings</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Delay</strong></span>: This sets the amount of time before playing the original (dry) signal and the modified signal (wet).</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Decay</strong></span>: This displays the amount of decay or loss of signal when the echo is played.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Max Channels</strong></span>: Nothing about this is provided in the Unity documentation.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Drymix</strong></span>: This is the amount of original audio to use with this effect. If you are using Echo as a return effect, like we did previously, then Drymix should always be 0.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Wetmix</strong></span>: This shows the amount of modified signal to play.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note48"></a>Note</h3><p>The terms wet and dry are used frequently in audio mixing. Dry always refers to the original unmodified signal, with wet denoting the modified or affected signal.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec4"></a>SFX reverb</h5></div></div></div><p>We really only <span>covered</span> the surface of this effect earlier, so it is worth taking a closer look at. It is also worth mentioning that the Unity documentation on most of these effects is severely limited and inaccessible to newcomers. However, if you are an old mixing pro, most of the parameters will likely be quite familiar to you. For those without a mixing background, we will identify some of the important settings here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/8c3d04cf-8266-449e-a309-913eb696e31c.png" /></div><p>Default settings for SFX Reverb</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Dry Level</strong></span>: This is the same as Drymix. It controls the <span>amount</span> of the original signal to pass through. Again, if used in a return set, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Dry Level</code></strong> goes down to <code class="literal">-10000</code>.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Room</strong></span>: This is the amount of gain applied to the original or source signal.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reflections</strong></span>: This is a reverb that will use multiple delays to denote the various sets of reflections. The Reflections setting denotes how strong the first delay or echo should be. It is called Reflections to denote how much sound the walls in the room immediately reflect back sound. This first set of reflections will also be called early reflections.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reverb</strong></span>: This is the amount of strength of secondary or late reflections. Essentially, the sound that is coming back to the listener after it has been reflected off at least a couple walls or objects.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Delay</strong></span>: This is the late reflections. The sounds that have bounced a while before returning to the listener.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Room HF and HF Reference</strong></span>: This controls the gain on the input high frequency and cutoff point. It is similar to a Highpass effect.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Room LF and LF Reference</strong></span>: This controls gain on the input low frequency and cutoff point. Again, it is similar to a Lowpass effect.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Diffusion and Density</strong></span>: These control the correlation among the delay lines in the internal reverb system.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip49"></a>Note</h3><p>The Audio Mixer in Unity is built on top of the FMOD plugins. As such, all the effects we look at here are also available in FMOD Studio with a better interface and documentation. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to FMOD</em></span>, we will download and install FMOD Studio and also cover more effects then.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec5"></a>Flange</h5></div></div></div><p>this is another delay effect that <span>produces</span> a more synthetic synthesizer sound by <span>remixing</span> the dry and wet signals offset by usually less than 20 ms. This effect is used quite heavily in the music industry to produce interesting instrumental or vocal effects. Like the other delay effects, it is best used with a Send/Receive on a return group or bus. This would be a good effect to enhance machinery, lasers, spells, or other non-natural sounds.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note50"></a>Note</h3><p>Bus in mixing terminology denotes a single audio channel or group where multiple sources may be routed through. In the Unity Audio Mixer this is synonymous with group, and we may use the term bus to denote a mixed group. The Master group is a bus, for instance.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec6"></a>Chorus</h5></div></div></div><p>A Chorus effect is a <span>way</span> of taking multiple audio sources of a <span>similar</span> timbre and pitch and then harmonizing them together to produce a single blended sound. This is another heavily used effect in modern music where instruments and vocals may be tuned to more closely harmonize without any noticeable differences. It is a good effect to use when you want to create distinct new tones from various audio sources.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"></a>Note</h3><p>Timbre is often used to denote the tone quality or color of a sound. It is that tonal quality of a sound, instrument, or playing style that allows you to determine different instruments and/or singers even though they may be playing the same note or frequency.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="03lvl3sec2"></a>Other effects</h4></div></div></div><p>The last category is for those effects that don't fit into any of the preceding or more general categories. All of these effects are especially useful, and we will look at an example using each.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="03lvl4sec7"></a>Pitch Shifter</h5></div></div></div><p>Another one of those <span>effects</span> that has had a huge impact in the modern music industry. This effect allows you to pitch shift or tune a sound up or down in frequency without changing playtime. Typically, if you alter the pitch on an audio clip, you may reduce or increase the playtime. The Pitch Shifter, however, preserves the playback time while still adjusting the frequency. Since this is such a cool effect, let's take a look at the following example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Unity to our village project and focus your attention to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window.
