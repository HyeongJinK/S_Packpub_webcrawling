Having the individual instruments on each track can, of course, be beneficial, especially when developing adaptive music using vertical <span>remixing</span> techniques. Likewise, understanding how the music changes can also help you horizontally re-sequence multiple songs more easily.</p><p>Follow the instructions to render the song we constructed to a media file:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open Reaper to the project you have been developing your song in. From the menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Render</code></strong>. This will open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Render to File</code></strong> dialog. Enter a name for your song and then select the options as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/90e9404e-155a-439c-8296-bb39a68a45b0.png" /></div><p>Setting the file name and options for rendering to a file
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>After you name the file and set the options, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Render 1 file</code></strong> button on the dialog. This will open another dialog where you will see in real time how the song is rendered to the file and what the resulting waveform looks like.</li><li>Click on the button labeled <strong class="userinput"><code>Close</code></strong> to close the dialogs. You will now see a new track has been added with your rendered audio clip. At this point you can solo the track by pressing the <strong class="userinput"><code>S</code></strong> button and listen to how the render went.</li></ol></div><p>From this point, if you are not happy with how the song rendered, you can alter the mix using the controls to adjust the volume/output. At this point, in the book, you should be fairly comfortable mixing or adjusting the tracks as you need to. In the next section, we are going to showcase one other excellent use for Reaper, recording and optimizing vocals.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="10lvl2sec30"></a>Recording and optimizing vocals</h3></div></div></div><p>Recording vocals or any other <span>sound</span> you may <span>need</span> for your game can be frustrating. What you think should be easy often doesn't turn out that way. To make matters worse, if you need to record multiple vocal tracks with a proper recording space, the end result will be inconsistent and noisy. Fortunately, since Reaper is a commercial audio generation tool, it has a number of good effects that can optimize your vocals or other sounds.</p><p>Follow the instructions to record and optimize your vocals:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up Reaper and from the menu select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>New Project</code></strong>. If you haven't already saved your last project, you probably want to do so.</li><li>Double-click on the gray area beside the track area. This will add a new track. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Record Armed</code></strong> button on the track and make sure that the <strong class="userinput"><code>Record Input</code></strong> option is selected on the input options as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/0076f537-7f77-4485-a9a5-cddf7b7ce78e.png" /></div><p>Setting the track recording options
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>When you are ready to start recording, type <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> on Mac). As the sound is recording, you will see a wave form being generated on the track. Wait for a count of three and then start recording the vocals. After you are done type <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>R)</em></span> to stop recording.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note179"></a>Note</h3><p>The reason we waited for a three count before we start, is to establish a base for the audio recording. This base will contain just the ambient noise of your recording room or equipment. This could be noise like hissing, heating vents, and other sounds you may not even notice.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Click on the red button on the track to disarm recording. Press play to listen to the vocals and you will likely notice some obvious noise now at the start of the recording. We will use an effect to remove that background noise from the recording.</li><li>Use your mouse to drag and select just below the audio clip track the region just before the vocals start. Don't worry about getting all of it; if you waited 3 seconds, there should be plenty to select. Then, click on the green <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> button to open the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> dialog. Click the loop or repeat button on the play head controls located next to the record button.</li><li>On the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> dialog, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Cockos</code></strong> group and then select the <strong class="userinput"><code>VST:ReaFir(FFT EQ+Dynamics Processor)(Cockos)</code></strong> effect. Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> to open the effect parameter settings. Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mode</code></strong> and option as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787286450/graphics/ef04ebc5-6309-4d54-9813-49f6fd6db0b5.png" /></div><p>ReaFir effect settings with subtract filter set and recording audio
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Press play to play just the <span>leading</span> section of the vocals. As the audio plays, you will see the noise sound being captured in the <strong class="userinput"><code>ReaFir</code></strong> effect as shown in the preceding screenshot. When you have let the audio section loop a couple of times, press the stop button. Uncheck the option <strong class="userinput"><code>Automatically build noise profile</code></strong> to turn off the noise capture.</li><li>Close the <strong class="userinput"><code>FX</code></strong> dialog and right-click (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + click on Mac), and from the <span>context</span> menu, select Remove Selection. Then, click on play again to play and listen to the audio. As you will hear, the noise in the audio has been completely removed.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip180"></a>Note</h3><p>Generally at this point, you would trim out the leading noise area and then add an EQ, compression and normalization effect. All of these effects are available in Reaper, and it is up to the reader to explore those in order to better optimize the vocals.</p></div><p>That covers our quick demo on recording vocals in Reaper. As you can see, there are plenty of capabilities and other effects you can apply to clean up and improve the audio recording.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note181"></a>Note</h3><p><strong class="userinput"><code>QUIZ TIME ANSWERS</code></strong><span class="strong"><strong></strong></span>
