They have also become the cornerstone or standard for several areas of AI, from image and speech recognition to playing Atari games. This sounds really intimidating, but actually, a neural network is a quite a simple and elegant structure modeled after our own human brain. The foundation of our brain and nervous system is a single neuron, shown in the following image beside a simulated computer neuron:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789138139/graphics/f42215de-c55f-4098-adef-51a95f75949a.jpg" /></div><p>
A neuron</p><p>The simulated neuron in the preceding diagram represents the structure of a single neuron. The inputs, or signals, into the neuron are typically summed and then evaluated against some form of activation function. You can see an example activation function in the diagram. When a neuron is activated, or fired, it sends out an output that can either be fed into more neurons or as a final output. The following image shows a multiple-layer neural network:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789138139/graphics/413d54b1-9d04-4866-88ed-3f74b9a34806.png" /></div><p>
A multiple-layered neural network</p><p>The preceding diagram represents a typical simple neural network with an input and output and two hidden layers of neurons. We call the layers of neurons in between the input and output hidden because we don't typically interact with these layers. The final layer, the output layer, is where the network spits out the answer. At first, that answer is rubbish, because the network is untrained and has no sense of what a right answer should be. In order to be especially useful, a neural network needs to be trained as to what the right or perhaps wrong answer is. There are numerous ways to do this, but the more common way is to back-propagate the errors from the output back through the network.</p><p>Backwards propagation is a fundamental <span>concept</span><a id="id325394026" class="indexterm"></a> in neural networks and deep learning. It is a method whereby the activation function of each neuron gets weighted based on its contribution to the total amount of error. We generally do this in a very slow, iterative manner in order to find the best fit. This means that a typical neural network needs to be exposed to thousands of samples or iterations to develop effectively.</p><p>We don't have time to go into back propagation, gradient descent, and activation functions in any detail. It is recommended that you take an hour or so and learn these fundamentals when you have the time, perhaps between chapters. There are plenty of great resources online that can delve into the details of neural networks in any depth you need.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec22"></a>But what does it do?</h3></div></div></div><p>At their core, neural networks are just <span>really</span><a id="id325397545" class="indexterm"></a> good, nonlinear function approximators, which means they are just good at solving equations. If you think back to our first example in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Machine Learning and ML-Agents</em></span>, we used a simple linear ML algorithm called linear regression to predict cannon velocities. While we were able to estimate things reasonably well with a linear method, what we really needed was a nonlinear solution. While there are a variety of other nonlinear methods we could use, neural networks provide us the ability to develop more generalized and better-fitting solutions, without all the math.</p><p>For us, this means neural networks—or deep networks, as we will call them—will be used as a tool to solve our Q-learning equations and other more complex problems. We will look at how we can use a neural network to solve a Q-learning problem in the next section.</p></div></div>
