Back then, C# and .NET were just newcomers and Microsoft had a tough sell; after all, it was dethroning VBA and Visual Basic as well as trying to steal away Java developers. The game allowed developers to build tiny programmable creatures that would be born, eat, sleep, reproduce, and die in a terrarium. It also featured the ability of allowing tiny programs to infect other connected terrariums. In fact, Microsoft has a contest that pitted these tiny creature programs against each other and the winning developer was the one that had the most successful creature. While we won't go so far as to build a connected terrarium infrastructure, we will do our best to replicate a number of the cooler features that made the original game so entertaining (as a developer, anyway).</p><p>The focus of this chapter will be to develop a similar terrarium game which allows our agents to live and die, but with a few twists. While neural nets and other ML technologies were available at the time, virtually all the terrarium creatures were based on <code class="literal">A*</code> and heuristic methods that were created by developers. Now, we have the ability to let the little terrarium creatures program themselves and develop their own winning behaviors, possibly in ways we have never even thought about. This is going to be an exciting chapter and here is what we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What Terrarium was/is</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building the Agent ecosystem</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Basic Terrarium – Plants and Herbivores</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Carnivore: the hunter</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Next steps</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exercises</li></ul></div><p>In this chapter, we have a lot of ground to cover and we will need to go over some advanced Unity concepts quickly. If you find yourself in trouble, download the book's source code and look at the completed example.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip30"></a>Note</h3><p>If the concept of growing your own little programmable creatures in a terrarium doesn't excite you, then you probably picked this book up by accident.
