We started by walking through the installation of the Python tools and dependencies, where we learned how to use the more basic tools, such as Jupyter Notebook. Then we built a working ML-Agents example that used an external Python agent's brain. After that, we covered the basics of neurons and neural networks. From there, we took a look at DQN and a basic deep Q-learning agent using Keras. We completed the chapter by looking at another RL algorithm called PPO. As we learned, PPO will be the workhorse for many of our complex situations.</p><p>Our journey this chapter was more or less a setup for the next chapter, where we start to dig in deep and build on the foundations we laid in this chapter. We will take a closer look at PPO and how it can drive other more sophisticated learning scenarios in the next chapter.</p></div>
