What we didn't cover are the details of how this code worked and what it is capable of. While teaching you about all the details of this model would take a book by itself, we will try and cover the basic features in this chapter. Also, keep in mind that while we will be talking about the Unity-specific training implementation, many of the concepts can be carried over to other deep learning models.</p><p>In this chapter, we will look at several concepts that are internal to the <code class="literal">learn.py</code> training script using PPO and by exploring the <span>Unity ML-Agents</span> examples. Here is what we will be covering in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Agent training problems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Convolutional neural networks</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Experience replay</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Partial observability, memory, and recurrent networks</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Actor–critic <span>training</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exercises</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip22"></a>Note</h3><p>One thing to note is that our use of neural networks or deep learning solves a very specific problem. However, that doesn't mean that many of the same concepts you learn cannot be applied to other problems. Keep that in the back of your mind as you work through this chapter.</p></div><p>In this chapter, we are going to continue right from where we left off, so be sure you have completed the end of<a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python </em></span>before continuing.</p></div>
