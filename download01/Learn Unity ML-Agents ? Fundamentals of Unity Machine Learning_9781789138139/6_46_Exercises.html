Using the skills you just learned only reinforces your learning, and you should really appreciate that concept by now. Do an exercise; your brain will thank you later:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Create a variety of different <span class="strong"><strong>plant</strong></span> species, each with different points. If you are very ambitious, build different prefabs and use other models to represent different species.</li><li>Create a variety of different <span class="strong"><strong>herbivore</strong></span> species, each with different points and perhaps different models. Do your new animals perform better or worse?</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Create a variety of different <span class="strong"><strong>carnivore</strong></span> species again with different points and other models. Feel free to download other free poly models on your own and use those.</li><li>Encourage your friends or colleagues to build agents and see who can build and train the best creature. You can share this by exporting your creature prefab from Unity and then importing it into another game.</li><li>Convert the agents to use Visual Observations from the Vector Observation they are using. How much more difficult will this make the training?</li><li>The original Terrarium also allowed for agent communication. We omitted that due to time, but add the ability for similar species to communicate in some manner.</li><li>Build a fully connected peer to peer terrarium that allows creatures to hop among peers. If you can build this, your skills are way beyond this book and you likely work at Unity now.</li></ol></div></div>
