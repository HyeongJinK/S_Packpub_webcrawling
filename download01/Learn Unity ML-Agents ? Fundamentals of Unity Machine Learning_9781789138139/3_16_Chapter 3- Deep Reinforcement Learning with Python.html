Unfortunately, the number of states in an RL problem can quickly exceed billions. The number of states in the game Go has been calculated to exceed the number of atoms in the observable universe, for instance. Now, dealing with these unfathomable numbers of states and doing the math for these types of problems isn't trivial. In fact, it is only just recently that we have been able to grapple with these numbers, thanks to the efforts of Google and others in releasing some powerful ML tools collectively called TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a math-execution library that has become the cornerstone of ML research because of the power it provides. Now, the preferred toolset when working with TensorFlow is Python. Unity, not wanting to reinvent a massive wheel, decided to build ML-Agents around Python and TensorFlow. As such, in this chapter, we will learn how to set up Python and use those tools to develop more advanced ML agents.</p><p>In this chapter, we will dive into working with Python and a number of other ML tools and libraries. The following are the main areas that we will focus on in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Installing Python and tools</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The ML-Agent external brain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Neural network foundations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Deep Q-learning</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Proximal policy optimization</li></ul></div><p>Python has become the preferred standard language/environment when working in ML. Honestly, with the number of free and powerful ML tools available for Python, it really doesn't make sense to work with any other language or platform.</p><p> </p></div>
