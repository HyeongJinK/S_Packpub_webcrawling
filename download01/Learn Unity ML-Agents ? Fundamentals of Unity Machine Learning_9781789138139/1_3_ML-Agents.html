Before we do that, though, we need to pull down the ML-Agents package from GitHub using git. Jump on your computer and open up a command <span>prompt</span><a id="id324988421" class="indexterm"></a> or shell window and follow along:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note7"></a>Note</h3><p>If you have never used git before, make sure to install it from <a class="ulink" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/</a>. You will need to install git before continuing with the following exercises and thus the rest of this book.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Navigate to your work or root folder (on Windows, we will assume that this is C:\):</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>      cd/</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Execute the following command:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>      mkdir ML-Agents</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>This will create the folder <code class="literal">ML-Agents</code>.

<span class="strong"><strong>      git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>This uses git to pull down the required files for ML-Agents into a new folder called <code class="literal">ml-agents. git</code> will show the files as they are getting pulled into the folder. You can <span>verify</span><a id="id325397632" class="indexterm"></a> that the files have been pulled down successfully by changing to the new folder and executing:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>      cd ml-agents</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>      dir</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Right now, we are doing this to make sure that there are any files here.

If you had issues pulling the code down, you can always visit the ML-Agents page on GitHub at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents" target="_blank">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents</a> and manually pull the code down. Of course, we will be using more of git to manage and pull files, so you should resolve any problems you may have encountered.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip8"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are not familiar with GitHub and git, then you really should be. git completely dominates source control across all areas of software development now and is widely used, even at Microsoft, who abandoned their own source control for it. Do yourself a favor, even if you develop your code just for yourself: use source control.</p></div><p>Now that we have ML-Agents installed, we will take a look at one of Unity's sample projects that ships with a toolkit in the next section.</p></div>
