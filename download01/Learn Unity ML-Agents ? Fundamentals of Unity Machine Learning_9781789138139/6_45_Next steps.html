There really is no better way to reinforce learning than by doing; take a cue from our learning agents. If you have time, look to build on or use another new example using ML-Agents.</p><p>Outside of your learning and this book, you have just begun a journey in a new wave of programming. It would not be surprising that in the near future (25 years or so) that programming becomes a lost art. After all, would you rather write a bunch of code or write an agent that writes your code better, faster, and even automatically has it tested? Yeah, no contest really. Therefore, if you are under 30 and reading this book, don't plan on programming for the rest of your life, look to teaching the programming agents.</p><p>With that in mind, what are the skills you should be pursuing in order to give you true mastery of reinforcement learning and your ML career in general? The following is a list of what appear to be the most requested skills that could get you a job teaching ML-Agents:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Math</strong></span>: It may be hard, but it is the path to ML glory. At the very least, you should have knowledge in the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Probability and Statistics (fundamental)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Calculus</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">3D</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Tensor Calculus and prerequistes</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data Science</strong></span>: There are plenty of free courses and materials online that train the basics all the way up to building complex models. You will likely waste less time buying a course or books, so consider that option as well.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</strong></span>: Again, there's plenty of free material online that can teach you the basics but again, you get what you pay for and what you are willing to put into learning.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong></span>: RL is quickly evolving and it is quite likely that some of the techniques in this book could become stale quickly. Therefore, trust that working in RL is going to require constant learning of new techniques and innovations.</li></ul></div><p>Building on your skills will take a lifetime, so always plan on learning. In the meantime, if you are looking for some new projects to throw ML-Agents at, here are some thoughts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Self-driving and robotics</strong></span>: Why are we still letting robot makers drive their own bots? Seriously, isn't a bigger challenge also adding intelligence? Perhaps RobotWars AI? In any case, Unity provides the ability to simulate training of robotic agents in a multitude of scenarios.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Gaming</strong></span>: Well of course, but what about games where people train agents? Perhaps not unlike the little Tamagochi devices that were carried around in the 90s.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>AR/VR/MR</strong></span>: Integrating these technologies with reality experiences can provide ways for an augmented agent to perhaps assist a person in day to day activities.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Industrial simulations/augmentations</strong></span>: Businesses are discovering not only the power of 3D but the ability for Unity to support many wide and varied platforms seamlessly. This has caused a whole new growing trend of in-house business/industrial apps are being used from warehouses to hospitals. All are potential candidates for some form of smart agent scenario.</li></ul></div><p>The preceding examples are really only the start of what is possible and the limits at this point are really only your imagination. We leave the rest up to you and we hope that you enjoy your learning journey.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip35"></a>Note</h3><p>The author of this book is always excited to hear about projects that were developed by readers.
