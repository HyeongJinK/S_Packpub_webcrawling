We first spent time understanding the old rules and theme of the original game and those rules our creature agents would need to follow when building our simulation. From there, we pulled down some useful assets to make our simulation a little more game-like. Then, we built the foundations of our terrarium and created our first creature, the plant. The plant is essential to the life and training of our higher level agents like the herbivore, which was the next creature we built and started training as an ML-Agent in our scene. After building the herbivore, we moved onto building a carnivore creature as a way to balance and finish up our terrarium. Finally, we looked at suggestions for your next steps in training and other possible ideas for some exciting projects that use ML-Agents.</p><p>It is our hope that this book gives you the confidence to build on your knowledge and create stunning simulations, games, and apps that use ML-Agents to their full potential. This version of the book is only for the beta version, but the foundations of knowledge you have built will carry with you to your other pursuits in <span>AI</span>.</p></div>
