If you are new to Python but have plenty of programming experience with C#, you should be fine to proceed. For those of you with experience in Python, you may still want to pay special attention to the setup as, at the time of writing, ML-Agents is only supported by Python 3.5.</p><p>Python is a great language to learn if you are new to programming. However, for more experienced C# developers, it can be intimidating to learn a new language/framework that is outside the family, so to speak. After all, Python is more than a language: It is a multiple programming paradigm that also supports functional, aspect-orientated, and meta-programming. If you are not sure about learning a new language, do yourself a big favor <span>and</span><a id="id324673332" class="indexterm"></a> give Python a try—you may be more than pleasantly surprised.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec19"></a>Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>Proceed with the relevant setup for your operating system, as shown in the following two recipes.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec0"></a>Mac/Linux installation</h4></div></div></div><p>The following setup guide is provided as an <span>overview</span><a id="id324673236" class="indexterm"></a> of the guide that came with the Unity ML-Agents source we cloned in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Machine Learning and ML-Agents</em></span>. We included this guide for the sake of completeness, but chances are that if you use Linux, you will likely already have Python installed. Go <span>through</span><a id="id324673253" class="indexterm"></a> the following steps to install Python and the tools:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Download <span>and</span><a id="id324673269" class="indexterm"></a> install Python 3 from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.</li><li>Make sure pip is installed as well. If you're not sure, check <a class="ulink" href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/#installing-pip-setuptools-wheel-with-linux-package-managers" target="_blank">https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/#installing-pip-setuptools-wheel-with-linux-package-managers</a>.</li><li>Navigate to the <code class="literal">ML-Agents</code> folder, which we cloned earlier.</li><li>Navigate to the <code class="literal">python</code> folder and type the following command:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>      pip3 install .</strong></span></pre><p>You should see the required dependencies get installed.</p><p>If you have any problems, be sure to consult the Unity docs for any special instructions. Overall, installing Python and the required dependencies on macOS/Linux is embarrassingly simple compared to installing them on Windows, which we will cover next.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec1"></a>Windows installation</h4></div></div></div><p>The current version of Unity ML-Agents has only <span>been</span><a id="id324988472" class="indexterm"></a> found to work with Windows 10. You can try to use an earlier operating system, but expect to encounter issues. If you do, use the following guide to install the Python environment for ML-Agents:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Install Anaconda 3.6 (64-bit) from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a>.</li><li>Follow the instructions of the installer. Be <span>sure</span><a id="id324988494" class="indexterm"></a> to use the Advanced Options and set the PATH as shown in the following:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789138139/graphics/fd08b508-a6fb-4648-8222-88d03fc30696.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li><p>While this isn't recommended, setting this option will be useful for us in later sections of the book. Anaconda will prompt you to install Visual Studio Code after it has finished the installation. If you don't already have VS Code, be sure to select this option to download and install it as well. We will use VS Code in a later chapter of this book, and installing it now will save you a step later on.</p></li><li><p>Test the installation of Anaconda by<span>launching</span><a id="id324988524" class="indexterm"></a>Anaconda Navigator. Press the Windows key and then enter anaconda navigator to quickly find and launch the app. Leave the app open, as we will get back to it shortly.</p></li><li>Open a new Anaconda prompt by entering anaconda prompt in the search bar (press the Windows key).</li><li>Enter the following command in the prompt window:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>conda create -n ml-agents python=3.5</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>This command will create a new 3.5 Python environment named <code class="literal">[-n] ml-agents</code>. Follow any prompts that require you to download dependencies, for which, of course, you will want to be connected to the internet. ML-Agents is currently dependent on Python 3.5; therefore, we need to explicitly state that we want to use Python 3.5.</li><li>Activate the environment by entering the following:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>conda activate ml-agents</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>Install TensorFlow by running the following:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>pip install tensorflow==1.4.0</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="10" type="1"><li>This will install a number of required packages, but we still need a few more.</li><li>Navigate to the python folder in the <code class="literal">ml-agents</code> source folder. If you recall, we downloaded this to <code class="literal">C:\ML-Agents\ml-agents\</code>, if you followed the instructions for downloading the ML-Agents source from GitHub in <code class="literal">Chapter01</code>: </li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>cd c:\ML-Agents\ml-agents\python</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="12" type="1"><li>Install the required Python dependencies for ML-Agents by running the following:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>pip install .</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="13" type="1"><li>Double-check the folder before running the <span>preceding</span><a id="id324988625" class="indexterm"></a> command.

While using a GPU is essential for numerically <span>complex</span><a id="id324673421" class="indexterm"></a> problems, ML-Agents does not currently require a supported GPU in order to run TensorFlow. This means that we can currently bypass installing the support for GPU drivers. If you want to use TensorFlow with a GPU, be sure to check Unity's internal docks and the proper setup guidelines for your hardware and operating system.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec20"></a>Testing the install</h3></div></div></div><p>After you install Python and the required <span>dependencies</span><a id="id324673436" class="indexterm"></a> for your OS, make sure everything is installed correctly. Fortunately, the commands to run the tests are essentially the same for all OSes currently supported. Go through the following quick steps to test the installation:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open a command shell or an Anaconda prompt window, as you did previously.</li><li>Navigate to the <code class="literal">ml-agents/python</code> folder. If you are continuing from the previous exercise, you should already be there.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Enter the following command in your shell or Anaconda prompt window:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>jupyter notebook</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>This should open your default browser with the <span>Jupyter</span><a id="id324673514" class="indexterm"></a> Notebook window, as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789138139/graphics/fada316b-4d0a-4342-b07b-909ab9c8320e.png" /></div><p>Jupyter Notebook running from the python folder</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li><p>Click on the <code class="literal">Basics.ipynb</code> file, as shown in the preceding screenshot.
