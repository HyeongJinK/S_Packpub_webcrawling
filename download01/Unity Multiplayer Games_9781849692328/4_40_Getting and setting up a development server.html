Copy the game ID for later, as we'll need it for connecting.</p><p>Next, download the developer package, which contains Flash and Unity client SDKs, and the development server: <a class="ulink" href="https://playerio.com/download/" target="_blank">https://playerio.com/download/</a>.</p><p>After downloading and unzipping this, navigate to the Flash folder and copy the <code class="literal">NewGame</code> folder. Paste this wherever you like (I usually paste it into the same directory) and rename it, then delete the <code class="literal">Flash</code> folder inside. Now, you can open the SLN file to begin developing.</p><p>The first time you run the server (by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>F5</em></span> with the solution open) it will ask for your credentials. Supply your developer username and password and log in. username and password are stored on a per-server basis. If you ever need to log out (for instance, before passing on server code to a third-party), there is a log out button at the top-right corner of the server application.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692328/graphics/2328OT_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>Now, the server is ready for developing.</p></div>
