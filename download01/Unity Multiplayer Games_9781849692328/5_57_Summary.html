PubNub is good for group communication and passing simple messages around, rather than multiplayer networking. It also has the advantage of communicating over HTTP, which is allowed by most firewalls (such as school or corporate networks).</p><p>â€©We learned how to publish messages to channels, and subscribe to receive messages from a channel. We applied this knowledge to creating a global chatbox application where users can talk to each other.</p><p>In the next chapters, we'll begin covering more advanced networking concepts, starting with interpolating networked entities, and client-side prediction.</p></div>
