We learned how to connect to a Photon Server, send operation requests, and receive events or operation responses. We also learned how to make a custom server application that receives these requests and sends back responses, or broadcasts events.</p><p>We then applied these concepts to create a simple star collector game, where players race to collect as many "stars" as possible, and the player with the most stars, after all stars are collected wins the game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will cover another dedicated server technology known as Player.IO.</p></div>
