One of the biggest differences is that Player.IO is cloud-hosted. That is, your game code runs on a cluster of shared servers (whereas Photon requires you to host your own server), and it is also possible to rent dedicated clusters in this cloud. Additionally, Player.IO is room-based. Upon connecting to Player.IO, you specify a room to connect to, and players are segregated into different rooms. For instance, in an MMO you might have different "rooms" for regions in the world. Without a dedicated cluster, rooms are limited to 45 players. If you rent a dedicated cluster, there is no limit.</p><p>One final, big<a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a> difference in Player.IO: as Player.IO was originally designed for Flash applications, and Flash does not support UDP, Player.IO supports TCP only. Additionally, Player.IO has a strict limit on message processing, and too many messages can result in disconnects.</p><p>Other than that, most concepts learned with Photon will apply to Player.IO, although the specifics may be different. With that aside, let's set up a development server for testing.</p></div>
