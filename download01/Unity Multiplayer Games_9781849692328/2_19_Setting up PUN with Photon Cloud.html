</p><p>After you've created <a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a>an account, go to the Dashboard (<span class="strong"><strong>My Photon</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span>) and create a new Application. The name is not important, but you'll want to copy the ID for later.</p><p>Next, visit the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> and search for <span class="strong"><strong>Photon Unity Networking</strong></span>. The first asset you see should be <span class="strong"><strong>Photon Unity Networking Free</strong></span>. Download this asset into your project.</p><p>Upon downloading the plugin, and importing via <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package</strong></span>, you are prompted with a window asking you to sign up, enter an app ID, or setup a custom-hosted server.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692328/graphics/2328OT_02_01.jpg" /></div><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> option, assuming you have already created an account with Photon Cloud. <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>Select which region you want to use by default, and<a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a> paste the ID you copied from the website into the <span class="strong"><strong>AppId</strong></span> field, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><p>You are now ready to begin using the PUN plugin.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>Photon relies on sockets to connect, and while it does work in webplayer or standalone builds with Unity Free, it does not work on iOS or Android builds with the free license (since these disallow use of .NET sockets). However, in some cases there appears to be undocumented Android support on the 30 day Pro trial.</p></div></div>
