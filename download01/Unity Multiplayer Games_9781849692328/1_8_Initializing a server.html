The following script initializes a server on port 25000 which allows 8 clients to connect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ExampleUnityNetworkInitializeServer : MonoBehavior
{
  void OnGUI()
  {
    if( GUILayout.Button( "Launch Server" ) )

  // launch the server
  void LaunchServer()
  {
    // Start a server that enables NAT punchthrough,
    // listens on port 25000,
    // and allows 8 clients to connect
    Network.InitializeServer( 8, 25005, true );
  }

  // called when the server has been initialized
  void OnServerInitialized()
  {
    Debug.Log( "Server initialized" );
  }
}</pre></div><p>You can <a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a>also optionally enable an incoming password (useful for private games) by setting <code class="literal">Network.incomingPassword</code> to a password string of the player's choice, and initializing a general-purpose security layer by calling <code class="literal">Network.InitializeSecurity()</code>. Both of these should be set up before actually initializing the server.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that incoming connections does not mean maximum player count, since it does not include the host (for example, if you allow 8 players to connect, it's possible for 9 players to play in the same roomâ€”8 clients plus the host).</p></div></div>
