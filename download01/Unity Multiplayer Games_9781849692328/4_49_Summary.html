Player.IO differs from Photon in that it's better suited to room-based setups and smaller Flash-type games, rather than network-heavy twitch games or massively multiplayer games. It also cannot be self-hosted, similar to Photon Cloud.</p><p>We have learned how to connect, join rooms, send and receive messages, and work with BigDB for persisting player data. We then applied this knowledge in creating a pseudo-RTS demo where the player can command 5 units to attack other player-controlled units. In the process, we also learned how we can generate a unique 64 bit ID on the client with no server intervention by using a 32 bit player ID.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll cover our final networking system, an HTTP push service known as PubNub.</p></div>
