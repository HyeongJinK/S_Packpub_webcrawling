This is what the Master Server is for.</p><p>Now that you can start up a server and connect to it, let's take a look at how to connect to the Master Server you downloaded earlier. First, make sure both the Master Server and Facilitator are running. I will assume you are running them on your local machine (IP is 127.0.0.1), but of course you can run these on a different computer and use that machine's IP address. Keep in mind, if you want the Master Server publicly accessible, it must be installed on a machine with a public IP address (it cannot be in a private network).</p><p>Let's configure Unity to use our Master Server rather than the Unity-hosted test server. The following script configures the Master Server and Facilitator to connect to a given IP (by default 127.0.0.1):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ExampleUnityNetworkingConnectToMasterServer : MonoBehaviour
{
  // Assuming Master Server and Facilitator are on the same machine
  public string MasterServerIP = "127.0.0.1";

  void Awake()
  {
    // set the IP and port of the Master Server to connect to
    MasterServer.ipAddress = MasterServerIP;
    MasterServer.port = 23466;

    // set the IP and port of the Facilitator to connect to
    Network.natFacilitatorIP = MasterServerIP;
    Network.natFacilitatorPort = 50005;
  }
