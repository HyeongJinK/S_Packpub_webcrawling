In this chapter, we'll be covering another multiplayer technology from Exit Games, called Photon Server.</p><p>Photon Server<a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a> is a dedicated server middleware. That means, unlike Unity Networking or Photon Unity Networking, games are not organized by players (in rooms or hosts). Instead, players connect to a single dedicated server, which is in charge of processing game logic. This is the kind of setup you would see in an MMO (for example, a single region in the game might be a server).</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What differs Photon Server from Photon Unity Networking or Unity Networking</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Getting the Photon Server</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up a Photon Server instance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up the Photon Client SDK in Unity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a new server application</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Connecting and sending/receiving messages</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a central game logic class</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Assigning player IDs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a semi-server-authoritative Star Collector game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Let's get started.</p></li></ul></div></div>
