We learned to get a list of rooms in the lobby, filtered by user preference, and how to create and join rooms as well as how to add random matchmaking. We learned how to add friends list features, and making sure everyone plays on the same level.</p><p>We also applied these concepts to create a fully functional chat client. Players can create or join, manage a list of friends, and of course, chat with others.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be exploring another networking technology from ExitGames, called Photon Server.</p></div>
