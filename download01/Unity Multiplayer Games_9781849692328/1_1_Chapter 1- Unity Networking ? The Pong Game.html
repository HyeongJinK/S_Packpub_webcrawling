It's a staple of AAA games and small-budget indie offerings alike. Multiplayer games tap into our most basic human desires. Whether it be teaming up with strangers to survive a zombie apocalypse, or showing off your skills in a round of "Capture the Flag" on your favorite map, no artificial intelligence in the world comes close to the feeling of playing with a living, breathing, and thinking human being.</p><p>Unity3D<a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a> has a sizable number of third-party networking middleware aimed at developing multiplayer games, and is arguably one of the easiest platforms to prototype multiplayer games.</p><p>The first networking system most people encounter in Unity is the built-in <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Networking API</strong></span>.
<a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a> This API simplifies a great many tasks in writing networked code by providing a framework for networked objects rather than just sending messages. This works by providing a NetworkView component, which can serialize object state and call functions across the network.</p><p>Additionally, Unity provides a Master server, which essentially lets players search among all public servers to find a game to join, and can also help players in connecting to each other from behind private networks.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Introducing multiplayer</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Introducing UDP communication</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up your own Master server for testing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What a NetworkView is</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Serializing object state</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Calling RPCs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Starting servers and connecting to them</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using the Master server API to register servers and browse available hosts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up a dedicated server model</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Loading networked levels</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a Pong clone using Unity networking</p></li></ul></div></div>
