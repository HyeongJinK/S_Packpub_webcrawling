For instance, the server now immediately runs a simulation step when the user sends input. One only needs to send input at a faster rate in order to exploit this system.</p><p>We can modify our server to process input at a fixed rate, perhaps via a queue of move commands which are processed one at a time in <code class="literal">FixedUpdate</code>. Care needs to be taken to ensure that the server doesn't fall behind when processing user input.</p><p>The server <a id="id300" class="indexterm"></a>could also keep track of the last processed input message, and when a new message is received the server compares the timestamps, discarding the new message if the timestamps are too close together. This could also be potentially exploited if the user tampers with timestamp values sent with the message. You could impose a limit on timestamps, so they cannot be older than a threshold (say, a few seconds), and cannot be newer than the current time (which is physically impossible). Additionally, the timestamp of the last message is recorded and messages older than the last message are automatically discarded. This imposes a much smaller window on hackers in which they can exploit timestamps, and once they exhaust this window they can no longer use the exploit.</p></div>
