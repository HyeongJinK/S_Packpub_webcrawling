We applied smart entity interpolation to smooth the movement of entities and closely replicate the original motion of the player. We then modified our code to employ server-authoritative simulation for a hack-free game, with client-side input prediction with almost no rubber banding at all.</p><p>These concepts are particularly well suited to games utilizing direct client-to-server connections where the server will be simulating the state of the game, and for networking systems that allow for the use of unreliable messages to be sent.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll cover a simple way to remove the need to lead targets in a server-authoritative shooter game: hitbox rewinding.</p></div>
