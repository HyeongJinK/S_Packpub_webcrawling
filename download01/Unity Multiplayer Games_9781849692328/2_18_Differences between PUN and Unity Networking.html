However, there are many key differences and some code is not compatible without changes.</p><p>In PUN, nearly all of the main functions are contained in the <code class="literal">PhotonNetwork</code> class (meant to be analogous to the <code class="literal">Network</code> class in Unity). There is no MasterServer equivalent in PUN: all the required functions are moved to the <code class="literal">PhotonNetwork</code> class.</p><p>Rather than initializing servers, in PUN you create "rooms" via <code class="literal">PhotonNetwork.CreateRoom</code>. Rooms are essentially partitions on the game server to separate groups of players from each other.</p><p>There is no longer a concept of host IP. Instead, to connect to a room, you pass either <code class="literal">Room</code> to the <code class="literal">JoinRoom</code> function, or you pass the name of the room (room names are required to be unique).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>Because of the way Photon Unity Networking works, direct LAN connection is not possible as rather than connecting to each other, players connect to a central server cluster. Players are required to be connected to the Internet to play with each other, even if they are on the same local network.</p></div><p>PUN also has PhotonViews, rather than NetworkViews, although they serve a very similar purpose. State serialization is done via the <code class="literal">OnSerializePhotonView</code> method, and RPC calls work almost exactly the same way they do in Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"></a>Note</h3><p>There is a key difference in behavior between the <span class="strong"><strong>PUN RPC</strong></span> calls and <span class="strong"><strong>Unity RPC</strong></span> calls.<a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a> In Unity, unless you broadcast a message to all, you can't directly send a message to yourself. However, PUN does not have this restriction.</p></div><p>There is one very big difference between Photon Unity Networking and Unity Networking. Whereas <code class="literal">Network.Instantiate</code> simply takes a prefab and instantiates it, <code class="literal">PhotonNetwork.Instantiate</code> does not have access to many of the things <code class="literal">Network.Instantiate</code> makes use of (for example, <code class="literal">Network.Instantiate</code> likely sends some kind of <a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a>metadata like an asset ID which can be used to instantiate the object on the receiving end). So <code class="literal">PhotonNetwork.Instantiate</code> instead takes a string for the name of the object, and it will load the object from a <code class="literal">Resources</code> folder in your project (via <code class="literal">Resources.Load</code>). Therefore, all of your networked objects need to be included in a <code class="literal">Resources</code> folder.</p><p>Now that we've covered what makes PUN different, let's get started setting up PUN and Photon Cloud</p></div>
