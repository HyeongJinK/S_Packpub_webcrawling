In this chapter, we will be covering another dedicated server technology known as Player.IO.</p><p>Just like Photon Server, Player.IO <a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a>runs dedicated server code, where players connect to the server and send messages, and the server processes game logic. Player.IO also includes a variety of other features such as login/account systems, databases, leaderboards, and so on. Additionally, it is similar to Photon Cloud in that servers are hosted by the service, and cannot be self-hosted.</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What makes Player.IO different from Photon Server</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up a development server instance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up the Unity client SDK</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Connecting to Player.IO, joining rooms, and sending/receiving messages</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Loading and saving data via BigDB</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Generating instant object IDs client-side</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a simple multiplayer RTS prototype</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's dive in.</p></div>
