<span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> tool<a id="id258" class="indexterm"></a>, which is easy to get started with. A terrain<a id="id259" class="indexterm"></a> is a large subdivided plane, where <a id="id260" class="indexterm"></a>vertices can be lifted in <a id="id261" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>-direction: a so-called height field. While it takes a lot of effort to fine-tune to perfection, it provides the following interesting <a id="id262" class="indexterm"></a>features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>You can paint the height using brushes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>You can also paint the materials using texture maps</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>You can add accessories, such as trees, bushes, and grass, which can move, as if the wind was blowing them</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>When you already have a grey-scale height-image for your terrain, maybe made in Photoshop or<a id="id263" class="indexterm"></a> containing real-world geography data, you can import this <a id="id264" class="indexterm"></a>as a raw image. Refer to the documentation on: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/terrain-Height.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/terrain-Height.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you created the terrain already inside your 3D environment, it can be loaded as a Mesh, just like any other imported Mesh. However, a regular mesh cannot<a id="id265" class="indexterm"></a> be combined with the<a id="id266" class="indexterm"></a> features of the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> module.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>It is possible, with some effort, to turn a terrain from Google Earth into a Unity terrain. The process is documented by artist <span class="emphasis"><em>3D Nemo</em></span> on: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.3dnemo.com/031_G_to_U.html" target="_blank">http://www.3dnemo.com/031_G_to_U.html</a>. A terrain mesh is loaded inside SketchUp and the terrain textures are assembled in a Photoshop image. The final step, for which a script is provided, makes a Unity terrain, by sampling the height from the mesh. This is interesting, since copying the reference mesh into a real terrain can use all native Unity terrain features.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you just want to add a basic model, you can import it as a mesh, but donot expect things to move or be interactive. For that, the Unity terrain is more suited. Due to space constraints, we refer to the online documentation and other books that go into detail on this, which are available from: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Terrains.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Terrains.html</a>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec25"></a>Customizing trees with Tree Creator</h3></div></div></div><p>While initial <a id="id267" class="indexterm"></a>versions of Unity came with example trees, there<a id="id268" class="indexterm"></a> is a dedicated <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span> tool, which has been included since Unity 4x. It allows <a id="id269" class="indexterm"></a>users to build up a generated tree from branches and leaves, with several<a id="id270" class="indexterm"></a> parameters controlling the generated 3D <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span>. To know more about the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span> tool<a id="id271" class="indexterm"></a> refer the online documentation at: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Tree.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Tree.html</a>.</p><p>To get started, load the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Creator</strong></span> package<a id="id272" class="indexterm"></a> that comes with Unity (<span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Creator</strong></span>). Start a new <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span> object (<span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span>) and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span> component. Here you can fine-tune the geometry generation parameters.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_05_02.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Tree</strong></span> component displays the tree as a hierarchy of nodes. Start from below, with the main tree node and <a id="id273" class="indexterm"></a>add branch and leaf groups. Each group is tied to its parent and controls parameters, for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Frequency</strong></span> sets the amount of branches and <span class="strong"><strong>Length</strong></span> sets the lengths.</p><p>To make the tree <a id="id274" class="indexterm"></a>visually pleasing, you need to add<a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a> materials too. The <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Creator</strong></span> package includes examples to be used. Create <a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a>a new material and use the <span class="strong"><strong>Nature</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>Tree Creator Bark</strong></span> shader. Add at least a base texture, for example, <code class="literal">BigTree_bark_diffuse</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Base (RGB)</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Alpha (A)</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Gloss (A)</strong></span> map and <code class="literal">BigTree_bark_normal</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Normalmap</strong></span>. You <a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a>need to assign this material to the <span class="strong"><strong>Branch Material</strong></span> property on each relevant branch group. For leaves, a similar default is included.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_05_03.jpg" /></div><p>In the background, Unity generates optimized textures in a subfolder called <code class="literal">Treename_Textures</code>, if you were wondering where these additional folders come from.</p><p>There is a lot more<a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a> to it, for example, using <span class="strong"><strong>Curves</strong></span> to fine-tune<a id="id279" class="indexterm"></a> branch distribution and setting up the possibility of branches<a id="id280" class="indexterm"></a> that break. Play with it, as the process is fairly intuitive, once <a id="id281" class="indexterm"></a>you get the hang of the material system.</p><p>And finally, when you create trees, they can be integrated in the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> module too.</p></div></div>
