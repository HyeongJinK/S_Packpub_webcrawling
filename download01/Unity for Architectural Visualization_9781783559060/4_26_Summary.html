We showed how to set up the <span class="strong"><strong>Third Person Controller</strong></span> and how you can use either the default worker character or one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> packages, which might come at a price. All setups, either FPC or 3PC also control the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> component, which is essential to display anything on screen. Without a camera, you wouldn't see anything happening. But you don't have to stop at a single camera either. You can layer several cameras in the same scene, using the <span class="strong"><strong>Depth</strong></span> field and the <span class="strong"><strong>Normalized View Port Rect</strong></span> section. You can overlay even more information or simply add static text and logos, which are easily set up using a <span class="strong"><strong>GUI Text</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>GUI Texture</strong></span>. They do not require any scripting. More advanced user interfaces will be discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Full Control with Scripting</em></span>, when introducing GUI scripting.</p><p>The next chapter will further fill our project with models and set up an environment. This will make our project more interesting, but also more demanding on the computer. So this is also were we need to think about scene optimizations.</p></div>
