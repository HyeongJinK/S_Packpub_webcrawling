They are at the heart of Unity. To add behaviors to objects, Unity uses components. If you need lighting behavior, add a <code class="literal">Light</code> component. If you need physics<a id="id371" class="indexterm"></a> behavior, add a <code class="literal">RigidBody</code> component. If you need custom behavior, add a <code class="literal">Script</code> component.</p><p>A script<a id="id372" class="indexterm"></a> has particular entry points, which define the flow of execution. Some functions are automatically called when the game runs, others every time the display is refreshed, possibly several hundred times per second. You enter the code into one of these functions or call custom functions from these entry points. In the background, scripts are compiled and bundled into your final application, so they run as fast as built-in functions and behaviors.</p><p>Internally, Unity uses the <span class="emphasis"><em>Mono framework</em></span>, an Open Source implementation of the <span class="emphasis"><em>.NET framework</em></span>, which was designed and developed by Microsoft as a modern and extensible framework. It works independently from the high level programming code the programmer writes, and supports multiple platforms, including not only Windows, OSX, and Linux, but also Android and iOS. While Unity supports JavaScript, C# and the aptly called <span class="emphasis"><em>boo</em></span>, in practice<a id="id373" class="indexterm"></a> most people use JavaScript or C#,. If you have a background in Web development, the <span class="emphasis"><em>UnityScript</em></span> version of JavaScript is the easiest to get into. On the other hand, C# is more akin to C++ or Java and is the best starting point if you have some programming<a id="id374" class="indexterm"></a> experience. Since custom development for CAD and BIM applications relies on such languages and since many Unity developers embrace C#, we will use this for the rest of the chapter. Luckily, scripts are easily ported between these languages and you can mix and match scripts using all supported languages.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>Some of the scripts in this section are based on examples generously provided by Pieter Jorissen and Ivan De Boi, from the Karel de Grote Hogeschool (University College) in Antwerp (Belgium).</p></div></div>
