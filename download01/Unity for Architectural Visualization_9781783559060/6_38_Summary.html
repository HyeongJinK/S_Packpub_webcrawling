For architectural visualization, this is good to emulate bricks, concrete, metal, and wood. To display a convincing glass, we used a custom (copied) shader. And finally, we illustrated procedural textures.</p><p>The final chapter will go into scripting and we introduce a few reusable scripts that can be used to further tweak and control what we learned throughout the previous chapters. </p></div>
