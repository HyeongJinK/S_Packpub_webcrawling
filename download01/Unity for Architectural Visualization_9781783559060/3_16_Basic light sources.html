Without light, everything looks flat and dull. Use additional light sources to even-out lighting and to set up interior scenes. In Unity, lights are components of GameObjects. The different kinds of light sources are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Directional lights</strong></span>: These lights are commonly used to mimic the sun. Their position is irrelevant, as only orientation matters. Every architectural scene should at least<a id="id132" class="indexterm"></a> have one main Directional light. When <a id="id133" class="indexterm"></a>you only need to lighten up an interior room, they are more tricky to use, as they tend to brighten up the whole scene, but they help getting some light through the windows, inside the project. We'll see a few use cases in the next few sections.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Point lights</strong></span>: These <a id="id134" class="indexterm"></a>lights are easy to use, as they emit light in any <a id="id135" class="indexterm"></a>direction. Try to minimize their Range, so they don't spill light in other places. In most scenes, you'll need several of them to balance out<a id="id136" class="indexterm"></a> dark spots and corners and<a id="id137" class="indexterm"></a> to even-out the overall lighting.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Spot lights</strong></span>: These<a id="id138" class="indexterm"></a> lights only emit light into a cone and<a id="id139" class="indexterm"></a> are good to simulate interior light fixtures. They cast a distinct bright circular light spot so use them to highlight something.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Area lights</strong></span>: These are <a id="id140" class="indexterm"></a>the most advanced lights, as they <a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a>allow a light source to be given an actual rectangular size. This results in smoother lights and shadows, but their effect is only visible when baking and they require a pro-license. They are good to simulate light <a id="id142" class="indexterm"></a>panels or the effect of light coming in through a window. In the free version, you can simulate them using multiple Spot or Directional Lights.</p></li></ul></div></div>
