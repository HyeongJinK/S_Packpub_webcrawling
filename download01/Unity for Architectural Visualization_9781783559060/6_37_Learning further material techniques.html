However, the material only defines the look and not how the actual textures are placed on the geometry. This is done at the modeling stage (for example, inside your 3D, CAD, or BIM software). The latest architectural authoring software provides textures as part of the material properties and allows you to define the real size of a texture map; for example, inside the ArchiCAD material editor, you can define the visual properties of a material, including setting the real world <a id="id365" class="indexterm"></a>size of a <a id="id366" class="indexterm"></a>texture as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_06_08.jpg" /></div><p>If you modify a material to contain another texture, be sure also to adapt the real world size of the texture map immediately, so that it will be positioned at the right scale.</p><p>When you export your model into Unity, the texture (as part of the material) stays at the same place. The projection of the texture map onto the model gets stored inside an additional set of coordinates per vertex, called the "UV" coordinates, as opposed to the XYZ coordinates defining the vertex position in a Cartesian coordinate system.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"></a>Tip</h3><p>Correct texture mapping in the model, before exporting it to Unity.</p></div><p>When you replace a texture with another that does not conform to the same size, you need to adjust the tiling of the material. This will change the appearance of this material on all places where it is used and this is not always what you want. Moreover, if your 3D model only contains solid color information, no texture coordinates are assigned and Unity has no way to link a texture to the geometry.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"></a>Tip</h3><p>Always assign textured materials on your geometry, even just as placeholders, before exporting to Unity.</p></div><p>Unity is not a <a id="id367" class="indexterm"></a>complete model and texture authoring tool, but is an <a id="id368" class="indexterm"></a>environment where all these are assembled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec37"></a>Applying animated textures</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity supports <a id="id369" class="indexterm"></a>animated materials through the use of Movietextures, which <a id="id370" class="indexterm"></a>can be used for animated television screens or other effects, but they require a pro-license and have some limitations on a mobile platform.</p><p>If your animation consists of a few frames, it makes sense to apply the technique of sprites. This is similar to a small cartoon movie or an animated <code class="literal">GIF</code>. There are (quite) a few packages in the Asset store, as they are widely used for 2D games, but you can create your own sprite manager with some scripting. You either have a series of separate images that get switched or a single image with multiple sections where you adjust the offset to switch to the next frame of the animation.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>At the time of writing of this book, Unity announced that a sprite management system would be available with the release of Unity 4.3.</p></div></div></div>
