We made a complete, free-roaming, real-time environment from a CAD or BIM model. That was not too hard, was it?</p><p>When all you need is a quick walk through around a CAD model, this chapter will help you a lot. This chapter explained the basic steps of exporting your model into Unity and adding a sun and a navigation control system.</p><p>It is wise to have a fast and predictable recipe, as it usually works out fine, especially when you are pressed by a deadline looming around the corner. This basic setup is the minimum that is required for an interactive scene.</p><p>Job done? Not quite. What we have shown in this quick overview might be impressive for your very first project, but if it is needed to sell a design, there is much more to it! The next chapter will start with getting a better lighting setup, including shadows.</p></div>
