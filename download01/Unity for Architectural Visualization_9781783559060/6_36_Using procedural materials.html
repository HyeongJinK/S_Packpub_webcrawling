Shading languages can be very extensive and support many other instructions. Current GPUs calculate advanced shaders in real time. The glass shader above is a basic example of a procedural shader.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec35"></a>Allegorithmic substances</h3></div></div></div><p>As we don't expect our readers to simply start writing such shaders, and this book has no room to discuss <a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a>them either, we suggest an <a id="id359" class="indexterm"></a>alternative route and use a procedural shading system that is more directly accessible for end users.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Allegorithmic</em></span> is a company that develops a procedural material system called "Substances". They have an authoring environment where you can create new materials and they even sell individual materials. Many 3D systems, including Unity, support substance shaders. In the Asset Store, check the <span class="emphasis"><em>8 FREE Substances for Mobile</em></span> package (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/1352)" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/1352)</a>, which illustrates the potential of these materials. Although they increase the loading time of scenes, they take few resources, so the resulting files are really small when compared with comparable regular textures. They look quite detailed even when zoomed in, and they are compatible with the supported mobile platforms as well. The following screenshot illustrates the available <span class="strong"><strong>Procedural Properties</strong></span> and the generated texture images:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_06_07.jpg" /></div><p>Installed Substances come in packages, with embedded materials and textures. Fold out the shader package icon in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and drag the underlying Substance material onto an object, as shown in the following screenshot. You can tweak many settings, so a single material can actually have multiple variants with widely differing<a id="id360" class="indexterm"></a> results. In the background, the procedural system generates regular texture maps that are applied without<a id="id361" class="indexterm"></a> any additional user intervention.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_06_06_extra.jpg" /></div><p>With <span class="emphasis"><em>Bitmap2Material</em></span>, you can generate a complete shader, including diffuse, specular and bump maps, based on a single image. It even has options to remove tiling, to make the texture seamless, to remove lighting, and to even out shading. Check out the free watermarked Lite version at: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5687" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5687</a>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"></a>Tip</h3><p>On <a class="ulink" href="http://www.crazybump.com" target="_blank">www.crazybump.com</a>, you can also download a free demo application for Windows and OS X that does something similar, by generating normal maps from regular images. The final normal map can be used directly inside Unity.</p></div></div></div>
