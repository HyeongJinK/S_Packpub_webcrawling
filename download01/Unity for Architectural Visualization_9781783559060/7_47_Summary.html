It might be beneficial to look around the Asset Store to add other tools and scripts to your arsenal, but a decent understanding of scripts is a valuable competence to gain in the long run.</p><p>Always strive for short, simple, understandable, and reusable scripts. If you need two unrelated behaviors, they might be better off being split into two scripts. To make scripts reusable for different contexts, give them a rather generic name. <code class="literal">RotateObject</code> is more versatile than <code class="literal">RotateDoor</code>. If variables need to be adjusted, provide them as public variables, so they become parameters of the scripts. Reusable scripts never need to be edited during usage, but mainly tweaked by their parameters.</p><p>Add easing and <span class="emphasis"><em>tweening</em></span> to improve smoothness and to obtain a visual, modern animation style. If you are pressed in time, you might cut some corners here, but they do provide an overall professional feel to your project, which is really beneficial. If you often need to write scripts that interpolate between values, a system such as <span class="emphasis"><em>iTween</em></span> can be a good alternative, but many cases work well using the <code class="literal">Lerp</code> methods.</p><p>And finally, start with a few basic scripts that you write and know yourself. Do not rush into turnkey systems that take over the whole project. You'd be surprised at how little scripting is really needed for basic, interactive scenes.</p></div>
