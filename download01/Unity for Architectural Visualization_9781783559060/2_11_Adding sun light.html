For architectural <a id="id121" class="indexterm"></a>scenes and environments, you probably need a sun-like light source. We will add a <span class="emphasis"><em>Directional Light</em></span> by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span>. This is a light source that emits light in one particular, parallel direction. Its position does not matter.</p><p>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> to activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> tool and drag the colored circles of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Rotate Gizmo</em></span> to point it downward, as direction is very important. This can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500_02_10.jpg" /></div><p>While we said that position doesn't matter, it often makes sense to place the Directional Light slightly above the scene, with the rays pointing towards your design, as a visual clue for yourself.</p><p>You can adjust <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span> to your liking. Slightly yellow with intensity between 0.5 and 1 is a good starting point. You can also activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Type</strong></span>, which enables <a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a>real-time shadows. Beware that this can be<a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a> computationally expensive. Further setup will be the topic of <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let There be Light!</em></span>
</p><p>We are almost ready to press play. We promise!</p></div>
