It is very important to learn how changes to the design can be propagated into Unity, by fully understanding the asset-based approach inside Unity. The workflow will be illustrated mostly with examples from <span class="emphasis"><em>Graphisoft ArchiCAD</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Trimble SketchUp</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Maxon CINEMA 4D</em></span>, but similar workflows can be followed with <span class="emphasis"><em>Autodesk Revit</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maya</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>3ds Max</em></span> or even the Open Source <span class="emphasis"><em>Blender</em></span>.</p><p>While prior experience with Unity is not required to follow this book, it is recommended that you also follow an introductory Unity tutorial to get started with setting up a project, creating, positioning, and selecting game objects, adjusting properties, and running the game. But don't be afraid, as we will explain the required steps along the road. Some good starting points are given in the first three chapters of the book <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity 3.x Game Development Essentials</em></span> by Will Goldstone (published by <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span>) and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Beginner Editor</em></span> official video tutorial series available at <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor</a>.</p><p>This chapter is mostly about workflow, and while filled with important comments, this is for the most part a read only chapter. However, it is important to get a grip on your workflow from modeling to real-time visualization.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Assets and the Unity workflow overview</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>CAD or 3D modeling software (such as, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Rhino, and Blender)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>BIM software (namely, ArchiCAD and Revit)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Updating the scene when changes occur to the model</p></li></ul></div></div>
