Lighting is essential in architectural visualization and Unity provides several options to tweak and improve the visual quality of your scene.</p><p>While you can get quite far with the free version, lighting with the pro-version is more advanced with Area lights, Bounced lighting, and Sky lights to improve Lightmapping results. In addition, the full screen image effects give a more polished effect to the result. Luckily for the users of the free version, real-time hard shadows were added for Directional lights in Unity 4.2, which could be used in any architectural scene. But use them sparingly, when you need interactive lights.</p><p>The next chapter looks at navigation in our project, using character controllers.</p></div>
