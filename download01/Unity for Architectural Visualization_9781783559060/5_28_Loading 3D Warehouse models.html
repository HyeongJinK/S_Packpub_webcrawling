Furniture, accessories, plants, cars, and people can enliven the project. Rather than filling the model with every possible object, place some key items on visible locations around the scene. There are several online repositories of models, animations, and textures. The Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> is an obvious entry, but do not underestimate the vast amount of online content that is freely available in <span class="strong"><strong>Trimble 3D Warehouse</strong></span>. However, as the <span class="strong"><strong>terms of service</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ToS</strong></span>) are not fully clear for usage in <a id="id253" class="indexterm"></a>commercial projects, you might want to rely on other sources or create your own models. You can either download models directly into Unity using the COLLADA format<a id="id254" class="indexterm"></a> or prepare them first in other software. It is advised to start from the SketchUp model and at least clean up the normals (front/back faces), as explained in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>An Integrated Unity Workflow</em></span>, before exporting into Unity and properly assign materials and texture scale.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559060/graphics/7500EN_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>The download of a COLLADA file, with extension DAE, is usually a zipped folder, with some additional files for textures and an XML file for use with Google Earth. In fact, a KMZ file<a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a> is the same thing. If you want to unpack the KMZ, rename the extension to ZIP.</p><p>When you drag or <a id="id256" class="indexterm"></a>copy the file into Unity, the importer routine creates new materials for each found assigned material in the model. It might be necessary to link the textures again to these materials, so look at the material names.</p><p>We often encounter the same problems as noted in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>An Integrated Unity Workflow</em></span> and <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Quick Walk Around Your Design</em></span>: scale, wrong face normal, and non-optimized geometry. We usually scale the model with factor 0.1 or 0.01, but when it still looks off-scale, try 2.54 (or 0.0254), for example, when it was made in imperial units (feet, inch). As always ensure the scale is right on the importer settings.</p></div>
