We can load additional geometry, to enliven the scene. You can even add detailed terrains and trees and a nice sky image.</p><p>However, this all comes at a price; that is, performance may suffer. So the last few sections looked at several approaches to lower draw calls and increase the amount of frames we can display per second. It is also obvious that a pro-license simplifies many of these optimization techniques, but with some experience and a few helper scripts, there is a lot you can improve using the free version as well.</p><p>Get ready for our next chapter, on further improving the use of textures and shaders.</p></div>
