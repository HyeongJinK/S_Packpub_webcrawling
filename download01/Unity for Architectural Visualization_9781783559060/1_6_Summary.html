Getting this workflow organized properly is required for working efficiently.</p><p>Many architectural projects start from a 2D CAD drawing, in which case there is little you can do inside Unity. If you have a 3D model, made in 3D CAD or BIM software, it is still advised to use a DCC application to pass the model through, to allow fine-tuning of the conversion. At best, this supports a workflow where changes to the design model can still be incorporated in the real-time model, without losing applied interaction inside Unity.</p><p>We explained common problems and pitfalls, and collected several tips: apply supported software workflows and formats, use meters as units, set up normals correctly, always apply textures, export models in chunks, and avoid excessive geometry.</p><p>Further chapters will explain the actual process in more detail, from simply getting started, to full control over graphic quality and interaction.</p><p>So without further delay, fire up your modeling software of choice and ensure you have a copy of Unity installed and activated, either the free or the pro-version. In the next chapter, we will load our project in Unity and add the necessary interactivity to walk around in real-time with very little effort, using functions that are installed with Unity.</p></div>
