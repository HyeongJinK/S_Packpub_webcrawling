Just drag your FBX character from Windows Explorer (or Mac Finder) into the Project panel, and Unity will load both the mesh and its rig automatically. The mesh should be displayed in the Preview panel. However, as we'll see later, it's possible to import only a rig and animation data minus the mesh. For the purposes of demonstration here, we'll use the MakeHuman rigged character included as part of this book's companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter05/Char_Anim</code> folder. This mesh is shown in the following screenshot.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_05_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Importing a rigged character into Unity</p></div></div><p>The first step for importing a rigged character is deciding on <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Factor</strong></span>, as changing a character's scale factor later can sometimes corrupt or invalidate other settings of the mesh. To do this, drag and drop your character mesh into a scene, checking out its proportions and sizes in relation to the rest of your scene. Ideally, <span class="emphasis"><em>stick to real-world units</em></span>; that is, use<a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a> the meter as a unit of measurement where one Unity unit corresponds to 1 meter. This means you should change your scale factor if required so that your mesh appears to be of a real-world size in the scene. This is important for both physics and lighting calculations.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_05_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Setting the character's scale factor</p></div></div><p>Next, switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> tab in the Object Inspector, and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Type</strong></span> drop-down list, select <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span>, if it's not already activated. By default, this value will probably be <span class="strong"><strong>Generic</strong></span> if the mesh contains rigging information, or <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span> if the mesh has no rigging information. <span class="strong"><strong>Generic</strong></span> should be used for rigged noncharacter meshes, such as cranes, three-headed monsters, snakes, trees, and others. <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> is the recommended setting to choose for human characters because it gives us access to the entire range of animation features in Mecanim, as we'll see later. After <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> is selected, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_05_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Selecting Humanoid from the Animation Type menu</p></div></div><p>When you click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to confirm a <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> rig, a check-mark or a cross will appear beside the <span class="strong"><strong>Configure</strong></span> button in the Object Inspector. This indicates whether or not Mecanim has <a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a>successfully identified a humanoid character rig inside the mesh file. For the character mesh provided with the book, and for the sample asset meshes, Unity should successfully detect the character rig data. However, if your own meshes fail, they will need to be configured manually. We'll see how to do that next.</p></div>
