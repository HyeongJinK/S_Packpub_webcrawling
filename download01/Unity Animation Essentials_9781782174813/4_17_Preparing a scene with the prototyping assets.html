The scene contains some props and assets to work with, and it was assembled quickly using the Unity 5 prototyping assets, which feature many prefabs and objects (such as floors and stairs) for easy building of sample scenes. </p><p>I will take that sample scene as the starting point, as shown in the following screenshot. However, you can build your own level to achieve the same purpose and follow along with this chapter, if you prefer. To import the sample assets package, just go to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package | Prototyping</strong></span> from the application menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_04_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Importing the sample prototyping assets</p></div></div><p>Once the<a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a> prototyping assets are imported, you can drag and drop the premade prefabs into the scene and start building an environment.
