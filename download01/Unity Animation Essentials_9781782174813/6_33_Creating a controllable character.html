The character will begin in an idle-neutral pose, and with the use of the WASD keys, the character will walk, run, and turn on the spot as appropriate. The project here will begin from a specifically prepared <code class="literal">Start</code> project, included in this book's companion files. This project contains only a blank scene, an imported MakeHuman character model, and the native assets for character animations, included in the character assets package. These animations include walk, run, idle, and turn animations (as discussed in the previous chapter). They were originally intended for a different character model, but the Unity Avatar system allows us to retarget different animations to multiple models, as we've seen before.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">Start</code> project for this chapter can be found in the companion files inside the <code class="literal">Chapter06/Start</code> folder. The completed project can be found in the <code class="literal">Chapter06/End</code> folder.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_06_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Creating a player-controlled character with Mecanim</p></div></div><p>To get started <a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a>with creating an animated character, ensure that you have imported humanoid animations for walk, idle, run, and turn (or use the animations included in the companion project). In addition, ensure that a character model has been imported and configured as an Avatar-compatible character, as explained in the previous chapter (or use the MakeHuman character model included in the companion project). Then create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Controller</strong></span> asset from the Project panel by right-clicking and going to <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Animator Controller</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Controller</strong></span> created will be used to control animations on the player rig when controlled using the keyboard.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_06_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Creating an Animator Controller</p></div></div></div>
