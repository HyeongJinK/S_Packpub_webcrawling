The Animation Editor produces the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Clip</strong></span> data, which defines a set of key frames plotting change over time, and these are compatible (as we'll see later) with the Mecanim System. Particle Systems, by contrast, are entirely procedural and do not save their animation data to key frames. Rather, animation is created dynamically within those systems at runtime, based on graph-based input specified using the Shuriken Editor in the Object Inspector. This allows particle systems to display an impressive degree of flexibility. In the next chapter, we'll explore Mecanim further, looking at various Mecanim-based animations that don't involve humanoid characters.</p></div>
