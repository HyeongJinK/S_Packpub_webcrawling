By creating an Avatar for an imported character, we can make it work easily with a variety of different humanoid animations from many different sources. This is just one part of what makes Mecanim so powerful; but, there's more to Mecanim than this. After we've imported and configured a character, there are many features available for controlling and interacting with animations, making them work and play together to create believable characters at runtime. In this chapter, we'll consider these by creating a player-controlled character.</p></div>
