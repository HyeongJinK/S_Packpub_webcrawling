If you're planning on making 2D games, such as side-scrolling platformers or casual puzzle games for mobiles, or if you're creating animated GUIs and menu systems, then 2D animation will probably be highly important for your project.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A 2D side-scrolling platform game in action</p></div></div><p>Before getting started, however, let me elaborate further on the meaning of <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span>, as opposed to 3D animation, to clarify the scope of this chapter and the kind of animation we are concerned with here.</p><p>By 2D (short for two-dimensional), I mean only a specific kind of presentation, that is, any scene presented using either an orthographic camera or a camera showing objects in a planar or flat way, not allowing the user to rotate their view and observe events from other angles. In this sense, even a 3D scene may be part of a 2D game because 2D relates only to a scene's mode of display through cameras and not to any intrinsic properties of the scene. Even so, most of our 2D work will be related to sprite objects, a special 2D game object type supported by Unity. So, let's get started. Our aim in this chapter will be to create an animated sprite character that runs through the level, playing a run animation as he moves.</p></div>
