You've now completed this chapter and this book. At this stage, you have a solid foundation for using the following: Blend Shapes, for animating morphs and transitions across vertex states; IK, for creating arms and legs that animate easily in the designated positions; and movie textures, for playing prerendered cut-scenes and other movie files.</p><p>Also, by completing this book, you've explored almost all of Unity's extensive animation feature set, including scripting and animation curves, animation windows, particle systems, rigged skeletons, key frames, interactive elements, and more.</p></div>
