<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec31"></a>Root motion</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Based on <a id="id204" class="indexterm"></a>the previous example, we've created a scene where an imported character undergoes a walking animation from the Unity characters package. On pressing Play, you'll notice the character not only <span class="emphasis"><em>plays</em></span> a walk animation but actually <span class="emphasis"><em>walks</em></span> forwards in the scene, as opposed to in-place walking. In other words, a walk animation plays <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the character moves in terms of his scene position. This happens because of <span class="strong"><strong>root motion</strong></span>. Root motion refers to any animation or change applied to the position and rotation of the topmost (root) object in the mesh hierarchy. The imported character mesh contains many child objects, for its bones and pieces. However, animation applied to the top-level object is regarded as root motion. By default, root motion is enabled for the character, which means that it will move when the animation plays. You can, however, disable root motion, causing the character to walk in-place, that is, walk without moving anywhere. To achieve this, select the character in the scene and disable the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply Root Motion</strong></span> checkbox from the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component in the Object Inspector.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_05_21.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Disabling root motion animates characters in-place</p></div></div><p>Then, the <a id="id205" class="indexterm"></a>question arises as to when root motion should be enabled or disabled. In short, root motion frequently makes character movement look more realistic, because with access to animation curve data, the motion of a character can be interpolated more effectively. However, disabling root motion gives you a faster and more responsive character motion, suitable for arcade and action games. Ultimately, the decision about when to use root motion depends on what's best for your game.</p></div>
