We covered the types of animation that are most common in Unity games. In addition, we examined some core tasks and ideas in programmatic animation, including the ability to animate and change objects dynamically through code without relying on pre-scripted or predefined animations, which will engross you in much of this book. Although this chapter marks the end of our coverage of programmatic animation (at least in a dedicated way), coding and scripts will nevertheless find an important niche and presence throughout most of the upcoming chapters. The next chapter continues our journey, with us entering the world of 2D animation for sprites.</p></div>
