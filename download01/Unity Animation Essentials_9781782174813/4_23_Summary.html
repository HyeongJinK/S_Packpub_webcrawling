Using a combination of these three features, we created an animated scene in which pressing a button opens a door. Although simple in design and principle, this sample uses a wide range of animation features and demonstrates just how much can be achieved in terms of functionality using only animation and no scripting. In the next chapter, we'll get started with character animation in Mecanim.</p></div>
