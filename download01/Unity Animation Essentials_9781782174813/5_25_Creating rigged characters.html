The purpose of the bones is to define the extent to which vertices in the character mesh should move and deform to conform to the skeleton. </p><p>This makes character animation easier because instead of animating a high-resolution character model and all its vertices, the animator can simply animate the skeleton (bones) and have the character deform automatically to match that skeleton.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_05_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A rigged character</p></div></div><p>The full details of character rigging and the rigging process are software-specific and beyond the scope of <a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a>this book. This book assumes you already have a rigged character to import. However, you can generate rigged characters quickly and freely using the <a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a>MakeHuman software. This software can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.makehuman.org/" target="_blank">http://www.makehuman.org/</a>.

It is in the <code class="literal">Chapter05/char_anim_walk_end</code> folder.</p><p>You can also find premade rigged characters in the characters asset package in Unity 5.
