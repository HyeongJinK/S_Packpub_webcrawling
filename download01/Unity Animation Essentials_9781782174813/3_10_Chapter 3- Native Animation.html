That is, it is typically known as a <a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>game engine</strong></span> in which premade assets (assets made in other applications) are imported and configured to produce a final game. However, despite this largely correct understanding, Unity does offer a range of asset creation tools, especially concerning animation. These are called native animation features. They include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Unity animation editor</strong></span>
<a id="id107" class="indexterm"></a> for rigid body animation, such as doors that open, camera fly-throughs, elevator platforms, and more</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <a id="id108" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shuriken particle system</strong></span>, for rain, snow, fireworks, sparkles, and other cases of intangible animation with many moving parts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Both of these are considered thoroughly in this chapter.</p></li></ul></div></div>
