It lets you import a flat, regular texture for displaying a scene as if it were a cardboard prop or billboard. Sprites are useful for animated characters and props, such as the playable character in a side-scrolling platformer. 2D sprite animation works much like traditional <span class="strong"><strong>flip-book</strong></span> animation<a id="id79" class="indexterm"></a>, where key frame sketches are drawn on the pages of a book, one frame per page, and are played back to create animation by quickly turning the pages and observing the effect. There are two methods of importing and configuring animated sprites for your game, and this section covers both of them. The sprite objects used here are included in this book's companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter02/assets</code> folder. So, open the assets and follow along with me. Let's start by considering two methods of importing sprites: importing individual sprites and importing a sprite atlas.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"></a>Note</h3><p>More information about sprite objects can be found in the online Unity documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Sprite.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Sprite.html</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec24"></a>Individual sprites</h3></div></div></div><p>If you've<a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a> created an animated sprite using separate image files for each <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>frame of animation, you can simply drag and drop all the frames at once into the Unity Project panel for importing.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Importing animated sprites as separate files frame by frame</p></div></div><p>When <a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a>you <a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a>do this, each file is imported as a regular texture.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Imported running animation for a player character in the Unity Project panel</p></div></div><p>To convert them into sprites, select all the imported textures in the Project panel.

In addition, the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> setting should be disabled so as to improve texture quality. Finally, the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span> option for the sprite should be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom</strong></span>, the location of the feet of most character sprites. This is because the feet <a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a>are where the character meets the ground plane and is effectively positioned <a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a>within the scene.

The imported frames are now configured and ready for sprite animation in the scene. We'll see how to do that specifically later in this chapter.

In other words, all the frames in an animation may be bundled together into regular rows and columns inside a single texture file, as opposed<a id="id88" class="indexterm"></a> to many separate files. These kinds <a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a>of sprite sheets are also supported by Unity, but they require some additional setup and tweaking at the import stage.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A sprite atlas texture</p></div></div><p>To import the sprite atlas, simply drag and drop the texture into the Unity Project panel.

To do this, select the texture in the Project panel. From the Object Inspector, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> option. Then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> option. This is because the texture file contains multiple frames, not just one. Disable the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> checkbox<a id="id91" class="indexterm"></a> for optimal texture quality and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Preparing the atlas texture in the Object Inspector</p></div></div><p>Choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> option signals that multiple frames exist within the texture, but Unity still doesn't know precisely where they are in the texture. To define this, the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> can be used. This tool is accessed by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> button from the Object Inspector when the texture is selected in the Project panel. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> dialog, you can manually draw the boundaries for each sprite by simply clicking and dragging a box around each one in the image. Alternatively, you can automatically generate sprite slices from a tiling pattern. For the robot texture provided with this book's companion files, each sprite is in a 512 x 512 pixel grid. To generate slices for this, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button in the top-left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Click on the slice button in the Sprite Editor to generate slices from the atlas</p></div></div><p>After <a id="id92" class="indexterm"></a>clicking <a id="id93" class="indexterm"></a>on the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button, a configuration popup appears. Fill in the slice parameters to generate slices for the frames in the atlas. For the robot texture provided here, the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> type should be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Grid</strong></span> (instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span>), since the sprites are arranged in a grid inside the image. <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Size</strong></span> should be <span class="strong"><strong>512 x 512</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span> should be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom</strong></span> to position the pivot at the character's feet.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_09.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Generating slices from a grid</p></div></div><p>After clicking<a id="id94" class="indexterm"></a> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> popup, Unity will divide the texture atlas into separate sprites, each of which is surrounded by a selectable border. If <a id="id95" class="indexterm"></a>required, you can select each slice and change its settings. However, for the robot texture, the default arrangement can be accepted, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button can be clicked on from the top toolbar in the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The slices are now created</p></div></div><p>Clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window generates a sequence of sprite objects, which appear in the Project panel as independent entities and are now ready for animation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_02_11.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Generated sprites from the atlas texture, ready for animation</p></div></div></div></div>
