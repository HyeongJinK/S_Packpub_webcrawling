The different states (such as walk, run, idle, and so on) should not, however, be triggered arbitrarily. Instead, they should be triggered based on the player input through the WASD keys. To achieve this, we'll need to use a script, linking keyboard input to the Mecanim parameters. To get started, be sure that you've created a scene, you have a character, and you've assigned the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator Controller</strong></span> asset to the <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span> field of the object's <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component. This ensures that the character model in the scene uses the appropriate Mecanim controller.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_06_18.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Assigning an Animator Controller to the character</p></div></div><p>Next, we'll need to <a id="id227" class="indexterm"></a>create a C# script file that reads the player input and maps it to the controller parameters, playing the animation. To create a script, right-click inside the Project panel and go to <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>C# Script</strong></span> from the context menu, like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174813/graphics/B04103_06_19.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Creating a C# script file</p></div></div><p>Name the script file <code class="literal">CharControl.cs</code>.
