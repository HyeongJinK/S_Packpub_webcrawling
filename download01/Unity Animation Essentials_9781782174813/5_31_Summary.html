You now have a solid and versatile import workflow for adding rigged character meshes into Unity. They now play nicely with the Avatar system and can effectively reuse animations from many other suitable configured meshes. This, of course, is only half of the story. Mecanim not only allows you to import and configure reusable characters for animation, as we've been doing so far, but also lets you define more complex animation controllers, allowing blends and responses to user input. This topic will be described further in the next chapter.</p></div>
