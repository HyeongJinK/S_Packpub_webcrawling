This class is used as a base for most of the special editor classes that we saw in the previous chapters, such as the <code class="literal">Editor</code> and <code class="literal">EditorWindow</code> class. However, the principal use for that in this chapter is to going to be saving data in a persistent way.</p><p>In some scenarios, this has benefits over using XML, JSON, or plain text files because Unity will handle all the serializing and parsing for you without the necessity of a custom parser or third-party tool.</p><p>When you <a id="id287" class="indexterm"></a>create tools for game designers, you may want to allow them to experiment with values that affect how the video game behaves.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn how to use Scriptable Objects to store data and make it persist in the Play mode.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec58"></a>Defining the chapter goals</h3></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will use Scriptable Objects to allow game designers to tweak level settings in real time.
