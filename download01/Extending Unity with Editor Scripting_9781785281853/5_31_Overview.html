Also, 2D mode is selected by default. In this chapter we are going to<a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a> implement ways to keep these restrictions by code, but until that happens, be sure you respect these in order to test the rest of the code.</p><p>If you have problems with the code, remember always to create a new level scene before testing the changes. This is because errors can sometimes corrupt data at the stage we are currently at.</p></div></div></div>
