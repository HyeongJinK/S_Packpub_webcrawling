If you are making a video game, you can look in the Asset Store and save time buying tools that help you with your development or assets that complement your gameplay requirements.</p><p>Additionally, this creates a new business line where instead of developing your own videogames, you can create tools of contents to help people to make video games and earn money from the sales in the process.</p><p>In this section, you will learn how to publish our stuff in the Asset Store, as an example, we will continue using the AppBuilder tool.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec84"></a>Installing the Asset Store Tools</h3></div></div></div><p>To start, open <a id="id401" class="indexterm"></a>the AppBuilder project, and then in the Unity menu navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>.

In the top-right corner of this window, you have two options: <span class="strong"><strong>Login</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Create Account</strong></span>.
