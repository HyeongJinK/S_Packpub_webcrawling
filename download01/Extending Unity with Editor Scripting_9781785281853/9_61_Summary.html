We are now able to create builds for specific platforms, trigger several builds in sequence, and add information to the builds to make it easier to match with a commit in Git.</p><p>The example covered here was small but it is possible to extrapolate in order to have something better that matches with the reality of your own project.</p><p>Using external scripts in Unity allows you to have the flexibility to interact with other tools, at least the ones that allow you to use command lines to do stuff.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will talk about how to distribute your custom tools.</p></div>
