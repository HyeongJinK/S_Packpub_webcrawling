If your tool requires a custom GUI, creating mockups is always a good alternative to get an idea of the final result. Remember, there is nothing worse than a tool that is not easy to use and doesn't solve the specific problem.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Always evaluate the cost of creating the tool and the time you want to invest in that. Ensure that the time and resources you spend creating the tool itself to save more time and resources later during development.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will continue working on the Level Creator, integrating the use of gizmos to display a grid meant to be used as guides in our tool.</p></div>
