When it is not possible to access the code of the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class to implement these methods directly, an alternative way is to use the <code class="literal">DrawGizmo</code> attribute, allowing you to implement the gizmo logic in a second class.</p><p>When you work with gizmos, you can change they color and the matrix used to be rendered. To achieve this, you need to overwrite the variables <code class="literal">Gizmos.color</code> and <code class="literal">Gizmos.matrix</code>, respectively. Because these variables are static, it's recommended to always save the current value of the variables and restore it when you're done.</p><p>Gizmos can help visually expose implementation details of code to artists and designers, and help them debug problems on the fly. Think about gizmos as a way to expose part of the code to team members who are not programmers. If an image is worth a thousand words, a good gizmo is worth more than a thousand lines of debugging code.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue working with the Level Creator tool by creating our own custom inspectors.</p></div>
