This class must inherit from the <code class="literal">Editor</code> class and must be nested in an <code class="literal">Editor</code> folder in order to work.</p><p>An inspector, such as a <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class, has its own message method. These events are <code class="literal">OnEnable</code>, <code class="literal">OnDisable</code>, and <code class="literal">OnDestroy</code>. To make changes to the GUI, you must override the method <code class="literal">OnInspectorGUI</code>.</p><p>There are several classes to add the GUI in the inspector: the <code class="literal">EditorGUILayout</code> and <code class="literal">EditorGUI</code> classes are similar, with the only difference being that the first one auto adapts the GUI elements based in a layout, and the second one requires the specification of a rectangle to be used as a container of the element.</p><p>There is a class called <code class="literal">GUILayout</code>, with generic GUI elements that can be used in a video game or editor context. The <code class="literal">Button</code> method is part of this class.</p><p>It's important to review the API reference of these classes because there are several useful methods to create GUI elements and knowing them makes it easy to make design decisions. Also, exploring the different signatures that each method on the API has will help you to customize how these GUI elements are rendered.</p><p>Without having to write a custom inspector, it is possible to create a GUI for the class properties using property drawers and decorator drawer. These require less effort than the inspectors and are applied using attributes.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue working on the Level Creator using editor windows to create a Piece Palette.</p></div>
