You must save your editor window class inside an <code class="literal">Editor</code> folder to make it work.</p><p>A big challenge in the creation of the editor window is to define the approach to create a GUI. You can use layouts if you use methods from <code class="literal">EditorGUILayout</code> and <code class="literal">GUILayout</code>, or take care of the position of each component using a Rect approach, which means using methods from <code class="literal">EditorGUI</code> and GUI. The best advice you can get here is to not be afraid of jumping around all the different classes to create your GUI.</p><p>Using an editor window or an inspector will depend of your design. Remember, the inspector was designed to expose parameters from a specific element. A window is more generic and doesn't require an inspected element to work.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue working in the Level Creator tool, focusing on the customization the Scene View. We will finally implement functionalities to start adding content to the level.</p></div>
