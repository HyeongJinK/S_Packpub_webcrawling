It is a feature supported natively by Unity and is flexible in terms of choosing which scripts or assets we want to use for that package.</p><p>However, if you are within a context where shared tools are a critical part of your development workflow, like a video game studio that tries to create standards and avoid reinventing the wheel on each project, using Git submodules is a better option, keeping the tools on each project updated and allowing collaboration for bug solving. If you are using another version control solution, there is a high probability that it will have something similar to this feature.</p><p>The last option reviewed was sharing using the Unity Asset Store. This creates new possibilities for anybody who has an idea for improving video game development in Unity, allowing developers to help other developers and earn money in the process.</p><p>This concludes this book. At this point, you have all the basics to start thinking of ways to improve your development workflow by creating custom tools. We have covered a lot of things but if you start investigating the Unity editor API, you will find more useful features that you can include in your tools. Most of them aren't well documented but you can always find support in the Unity community.</p><p>To finish, only one thing: don't be afraid to put Unity to use for your video games!</p></div>
