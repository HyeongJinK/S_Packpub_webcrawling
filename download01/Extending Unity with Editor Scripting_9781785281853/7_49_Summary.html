In some scenarios, they are also an alternative to XML, JSON, or plain text files to define configuration parameters.</p><p>Based on what we did in this chapter, with a Scriptable Object approach, it is now possible to keep changes you make to settings values while your game is running in play mode, easily swap between different sets of settings values, and allowing the separation of logic and data.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to work improving the asset import pipeline.</p></div>
