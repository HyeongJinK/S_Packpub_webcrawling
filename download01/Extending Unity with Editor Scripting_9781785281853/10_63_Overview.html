If you have invested time and resources solving a particular problem in a project using a custom tool, it makes sense to use it again in other projects too.</p><p>The challenge appears when you try to find the best way to do this distribution and also keep the tool updated. On the other hand, you need to know what happens if you decide to focus on the development of tools instead of video games and you want to distribute your tools, making money in the process.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn how to use packages and Git submodules for custom tools distribution that are more suitable for sharing inside a team, and how to sell content in the Asset Store.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec79"></a>Defining the chapter goals</h3></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will focus on<a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a> tool distribution using the AppBuilder tool we created in the previous chapter as an example.</p><p>The goals here are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating and using a Unity Package</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating and using a Git submodule</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using the Admin panel of the Asset Store to create a publisher's account and defining the information of the package to be submitted</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using the Asset Store Tools to prepare the package</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Submitting the package to the Asset Store</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
