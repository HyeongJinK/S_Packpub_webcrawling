For example, imagine that you have a set of waypoints to model the movement of a <span class="strong"><strong>Non Playable Character</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>) in your video game. If it is possible for you to see the waypoints, it will be<a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a> easier for you to make tweaks and readjust the movement paths.</p><p>Thankfully, in Unity there's a<a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a> class called <span class="strong"><strong>Gizmos</strong></span> that allow us to add visual aids to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene View</strong></span> in an easy way.</p><p>Here, you will learn about the Gizmos class and how to use this to create a visual grid that will help level designers position the level piece prefabs with more control in the level.</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <code class="literal">OnDrawGizmos</code> and <code class="literal">OnDrawGizmosSelected</code> methods</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <code class="literal">DrawGizmo</code> attribute</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Gizmos class API</p></li></ul></div></div>
