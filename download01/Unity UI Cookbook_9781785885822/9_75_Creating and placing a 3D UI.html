However, 3D UIs are <a id="id481" class="indexterm"></a>more dynamic. As such, it is necessary to consider the placement of 3D UIs. In this recipe, you will learn how to place a 3D UI.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec206"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To begin, we need to create <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. We can do this by adding any UI element to the scene, as we have done many times during this book so far, or we can add it directly by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then going to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Next, select <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, and in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, change <span class="strong"><strong>Render Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span>. Setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> mode means that it is positioned in the space and it can be viewed from all the cameras within the world, provided they are pointed towards it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_09_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now that we<a id="id482" class="indexterm"></a> are working in 3D, we need to keep the scale of our project in mind. As such, we need to make sure that we change the project settings<a id="id483" class="indexterm"></a> from <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span>. We do this in order to have adequate reference points (keeping in mind the added dimension). To change from <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span> mode, we have to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> button in the upper part of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel in order to uncheck it, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_09_06.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>As with any game, when creating UIs, we need to consider the resolution and size of our canvas within the world. This is because the resolution will differ from one project to the next, depending on the intended device that our game is likely to be experienced on.</p></li><li><p>After we have chosen a resolution for our UI, we are ready to scale our canvas down using <span class="strong"><strong>Scale tool</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>At this point, we need to consider the scale of the current UI elements. Depending on the locations of their anchor points, they may or may not be displayed on the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> (for example, located off-screen). Therefore, it is important to take this into consideration as we place each UI element on the canvas. Thus, especially<a id="id484" class="indexterm"></a> for an already implemented interface, it's important to have all the anchor points correctly placed for all the UI elements.</p></li><li><p>Next, we can rotate and<a id="id485" class="indexterm"></a> place the UI where we like it on the scene. As in the previous recipes, we can do this by clicking on the rotation icon or using the keyboard shortcut <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec207"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>The next section will give us a better idea about how to take advantage of the 3D world for our UIs.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec85"></a>Using the 3D world</h4></div></div></div><p>As we have seen in<a id="id486" class="indexterm"></a> all the recipes so far in this book, it is possible to use scripts to manipulate various UI elements. For instance, it is possible to hide and unhide certain elements or even change them. Considering what you have learned in this recipe about 3D UIs, it could be useful to create scripts that instantiate new elements. For example, some 3D elements can be better represented as part of a 3D UI than a 2D UI. In addition, a 3D message can appear when the player gets close to dangerous areas, valuable items, or a health bar attached above the player or a timer on a door.</p><p>They can be instantiated using the <a id="id487" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Instantiate()</code> function, as with all other game objects in Unity. However, this function requires the original object to clone, which for UIs is often a prefab.</p><p>There are many other possibilities for creating and modifying UI elements from the script, such as those covered within this chapter (and even in previous chapters). These include having individual buttons behave differently depending on the types of interactions with the player (for example, clicking, hovering, and so on), and also depending on how a UI element is intended to respond to an input from the player. For instance, a UI element changes shape, color, or even text if a player interacts with it in a particular way. These kinds of dynamic customizations occur by getting various components and changing their properties. This is the essence of user interfaces, and it plays a fundamental role in 3D UIs, whereby they also need to react to the world around them.</p></div></div></div>
