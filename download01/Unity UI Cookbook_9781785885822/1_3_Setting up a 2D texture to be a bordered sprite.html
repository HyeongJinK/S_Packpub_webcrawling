This allows us to force the resolution, but not scale all the parts of our image, in order to maintain the original appearance of the image. Buttons are often bordered because their appearance depends strongly on how corners are scaled, and we don't generally want them to scale.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To begin, we need to import our image.

However, not all of them can be scaled freely. Otherwise, it could look different from what we thought it should be. Therefore, bordered images are used to scale everything as it should be. Borders tell Unity how it has to scale the picture. When we drag the green points in the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, we are dividing the image into nine sections. Each of these sections is scaled differently. The central sections are scaled in both <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> directions (vertically and horizontally). The side sections are scaled in only one direction: vertically for the right/left sections and horizontally for the upper/lower sections). Finally, the corners do not scale at all. You can see these nine sections and the scales in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_01.jpg" /></div><p>Let's consider an example to understand why a <a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>bordered sprite is important for the UI. Imagine that we have a button like the one in the preceding image and we have placed it on the screen. When the game runs on different devices, the resolutions will be different <a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a>and Unity will scale our UI accordingly (see the next recipe for more information). Ideally, we want the button to look like the original one that we have designed as much as possible. This means, for instance, that we want to preserve the original curvatures of the corners, and therefore, we need to force them not to scale. This can be communicated to Unity using borders. In this way, the rest of the button can scale along with the screen size in order to fit it, but as a result, the button will look like the original one.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>The next subtopic will show us how to slice the sprite without using all of the nine sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"></a>Slicing with less than nine sections</h4></div></div></div><p>As you have learned so far, we can <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>use the nine sections of the border to define the scaling setting of an image properly. But we are not constrained to use all of them. In fact, it is possible to segment the image into fewer sections. This is useful when we have some UI elements that are attached to the border of the screen. In fact, in this case, the image will scale differently according to only those sections that have been defined. To do this, we need to drag only some of the green points from the corners, instead of what we did in steps 5 and 6, where we dragged all them. By tweaking these, we can achieve different ways of scaling our UI, and the right one depends on how we want our game to look in different resolutions. For instance, we can create something similar to this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_Extra01.jpg" /></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Since having a bordered image is very important when the UI is scaled on different resolutions and platforms, maybe it could be worthwhile taking a deeper look at<a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a> resolution scaling. The following recipe, <span class="emphasis"><em>Resizing the UI according to the screen size and resolution</em></span>, will explain how to resize the UI according to the screen resolution.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Moreover, it is possible to learn more about how to place an image in the UI in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding and placing an image in the UI </em></span>recipe.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
