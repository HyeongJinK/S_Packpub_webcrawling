We will start by making a menu appear and disappear, using only the <span class="strong"><strong>OnClick()</strong></span> event. Then, we will create new animations for the UI through the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> window. Next, we will deal with the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> controller as well. Finally, we will see how we can animate the lives counter that we made in the second chapter, using all that we have covered about animations.</p></div>
