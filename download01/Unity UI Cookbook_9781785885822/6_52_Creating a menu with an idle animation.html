We are now going to <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>see how to make an idle animation, where the object just cycles through a general animation, such as hovering or pulsing. To do this, we need to create an animation that can be played as a loop. In this recipe, we will see how to change the color background of the pause menu that we created in the first recipe, <span class="emphasis"><em>Appearing and disappearing menu</em></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec150"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>First of all, we need to create a menu. We can follow the first three steps of the previous recipe, <span class="emphasis"><em>Appearing and disappearing menu</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Next, select <span class="strong"><strong>Appearing Menu</strong></span> and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Property</strong></span> inside of the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> window. Once again, Unity asks us to save the animation, so we can simply select a folder and save the animation by naming it <span class="strong"><strong>IdleAnimation</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> view, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Rec</strong></span> button if it is not already selected in Unity. Also select <span class="strong"><strong>Appearing Menu</strong></span>. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image (Script)</strong></span> component and change the color. For now, we will set it to green.</p></li><li><p>At the beginning of the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> window, at <span class="strong"><strong>0 key frame</strong></span>, there is now the color key frame. Just move the red bar to <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span> second, which means <span class="strong"><strong>60th key frame</strong></span> for <span class="strong"><strong>60</strong></span> samples, and change the color again in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. In this example, we will use blue.</p></li><li><p>Now, select the first key frame at the beginning and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span> to copy it. Next, move the red bar to <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span> seconds, which means <span class="strong"><strong>120th key frame</strong></span> for <span class="strong"><strong>60</strong></span> samples, and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> to paste it. By doing this, we can be certain that the last key frame is the same as the first one. Now, the animation is ready to be played as a loop.</p></li><li><p>Since <span class="strong"><strong>IdleAnimation</strong></span> is set as a loop by default and the autogenerated animator has to handle just one animation, we don't need to do anything other than clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rec</strong></span> button again to deactivate the recording mode. Finally, we can click on play to see that our menu changes its background color over time.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec151"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>Here, we created an animation that is ready to be played as a loop. This means that the last key frame is equal to the first one. In fact, when Unity plays the animation and it reaches the last frame, it is<a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a> restarted from the beginning. So once it starts again, it's important to give an illusion of continuity. Therefore, since standing animations are always played as a loop, this is an important step. In fact, we also copied the key frame so that the first and the last key frames are identical.</p><p>Furthermore, for<a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a> creating an idle animation, we are not limited to changing just the color of the background. In fact, we can create anything that we wish; our only limitation is our imagination. Just keep in mind that the animations need to be ready to be played as a loop.</p><p>The first key frame equals the last one.</p></div></div>
