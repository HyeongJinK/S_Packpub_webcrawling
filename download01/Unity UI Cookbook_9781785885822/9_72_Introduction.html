Often in modern games, menus are in 3D. This is done for many reasons, sometimes to make them more visually pleasant and interesting. In some cases, UI elements are placed in the 3D world along with other game objects. For example, when a player goes to collect a pickup, some information may be displayed to him about that object. This chapter will teach you how to do this effectively in Unity. Some of the skills that will be covered in this chapter will be advanced features for placing UI elements within a 3D space and taking advantage of the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axis. In order to do this, we will also cover various scripts that enable our UI to interact with the 3D world to exchange input/output with the UI.</p></div>
