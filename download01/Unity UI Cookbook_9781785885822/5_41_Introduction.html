We will start with elements used to decorate the background, such as fading and rotating effects. This may perhaps include some with a very low alpha value. Then, we will demonstrate how to create elements for the foreground of our UI, such as sci-fi bars or a floating UI element. At the end of this chapter, we will explore the <span class="strong"><strong>UI Effect</strong></span> component, the <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow (Script)</strong></span> component, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Outline (Script)</strong></span> component, and see how we can use them to decorate our UI.</p></div>
