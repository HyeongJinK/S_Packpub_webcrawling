In fact, the system was hard to learn, and most of the features had to be implemented by scripts, including<a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a> scaling. However, in Unity 5, scaling the UI is much easier with the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler (Script)</strong></span> component. This component will take care of the scale of all UI elements that are contained in <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>If we check the previous recipe, we can see in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel that <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> is already present in our scene. This is because whenever we create a UI element and <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas </strong></span>is not present in the scene, Unity will create it for us. Of course, we can also create it on our own, and this can be done by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now that we have created <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>, we can select it. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, we can see all its properties and parameters, including all the components attached to it. By default, when a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas </strong></span>is created, the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler (Script)</strong></span> component is attached on it. Since this component can be removed, it may happen that it is not present anymore. In such cases, we can add it again by clicking inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> and then going to <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Next, we have to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Ui Scale Mode</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Scale With Screen Size</strong></span> and ensure that <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Match Mode</strong></span> is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Match Width Or Height</strong></span>. Furthermore, we can adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Match</strong></span> variable; for example, we can move the slider to the middle by changing the value to <span class="strong"><strong>0.5</strong></span>. We should now see this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>As a result, every<a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a> UI element inside <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> will be scaled according to our project's screen resolution, and they will all adapt to the device on which the game is running.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>In the Unity UI system, <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> is a special game object. This is because all the UI elements must be<a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a> contained inside it. In fact, elements that are not in it will not be rendered. By default, <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> comes with three components attached to it. One of these three is <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler (Script)</strong></span>. This component controls how all the UI elements that are contained in that specific <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> will be scaled. By tweaking some of its properties, it is possible to achieve a scale setting that best suits our needs. In particular, we have set the <span class="strong"><strong>Match</strong></span> slider, which allows us to proportionally crop the width and height of the view in order to adapt it to the resolution of the platform on which the game is running.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There are many other ways of scaling UI elements according to screen size to suit our requirements.
