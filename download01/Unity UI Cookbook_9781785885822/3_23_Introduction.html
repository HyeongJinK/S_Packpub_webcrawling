These serve many different purposes in games, such as indicating to the player how much time he has left to complete a level or after how long he will be able to use a certain ability again. Timers <a id="id142" class="indexterm"></a>are also a good way for players to experience flow throughout the game. On the other hand, countdowns can indicate how much time is remaining to complete a task, depending on the aspect of gameplay that we are trying to represent with a timer â€” for example, to let a player know how much time is remaining to complete a task, or how much time has elapsed since the task began. Both timers and countdowns are effective methods of altering the dynamics of gameplay.</p><p>We will begin this chapter by seeing how to create a numeric timer. From this, you will learn how to create graphic timers and, finally, how to implement a countdown that changes over time.</p></div>
