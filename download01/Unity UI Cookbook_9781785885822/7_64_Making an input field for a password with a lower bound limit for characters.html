This happens for a lot of reasons, including security. In Unity, we can easily set an upper bound limit for<a id="id410" class="indexterm"></a> characters by specifying it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Character Limit</strong></span> variable. In this recipe, what we are going to achieve is the checking of lower bound limits for characters in input fields. So, you will learn how to write a short script to handle this, and as a consequence, the input field will also be reset. This means an empty string is assigned to the <code class="literal">text</code> variable.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec182"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To begin, we need to create our input field, right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, then go to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field</strong></span>, and rename it <span class="strong"><strong>myInputField</strong></span>. Finally, place it wherever you want.</p></li><li><p>As we discussed in the introduction to this recipe, we are going to create a password input field. We should also select <span class="strong"><strong>Password</strong></span> in the drop-down menu of the <span class="strong"><strong>Content Type</strong></span> variable, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_07_19.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>In this way, only <a id="id411" class="indexterm"></a>asterisks are shown on the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_07_20.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Select it and, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Script</strong></span>. Name it <span class="strong"><strong>LowerBoundLimitForCharactersScript</strong></span>, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create and Add</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In order to edit the script, double-click on it. Again, because we are dealing with the UI, we have to add the <code class="literal">using UnityEngine.UI;</code> statement at the beginning<a id="id412" class="indexterm"></a> of the script. This is also because we are going to use the <code class="literal">InputField</code> class. As we did in the previous recipe, we can add this line before the beginning of the class: <code class="literal">[RequireComponent(typeof(InputField))]</code> (without the semicolon at the end). Thus, the script requires an <span class="strong"><strong>InputField</strong></span> component attached to the same game object of it.</p></li><li><p>We need just one <code class="literal">private</code> variable to store the reference to our <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component. And we need a <code class="literal">public</code> variable so that we can decide in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> which is the lower bound limit. Therefore, let's write the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  private InputField inputField;
  public int characterLimit;</pre></div></li><li><p>In the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function, we are going to assign the <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component to our <code class="literal">private</code> variable. We can get the reference by calling the <code class="literal">GetComponent&lt;InputField&gt; ()</code> function. Thus, we can write the function in this way:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  void Start () {
    inputField = GetComponent&lt;InputField&gt; ();
  }</pre></div></li><li><p>Now, we need to create a function that performs the check at the end of editing. So, it<a id="id413" class="indexterm"></a> takes a string as a parameter and checks whether its length — the number of its characters — is less than <code class="literal">characterLimit</code>. If so, it empties the input field. Here is the function:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  public void Check (string newText) {
    if(newText.Length &lt; characterLimit){
      inputField.text = "";
    }
  }</pre></div></li><li><p>After saving the script, the next step is to give the <code class="literal">string</code> that the player has written to our script. Thus, we need an event to achieve this. In particular, if we look inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component, we can see that there are two event tabs. Let's click on the small <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign on the <span class="strong"><strong>End Edit (String)</strong></span> event tab in the bottom-right corner.</p></li><li><p>Drag the script inside the <span class="strong"><strong>object</strong></span> variable, and in the drop-down menu, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>LowerBoundLimitForCharactersScript</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Check</strong></span>. Ensure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Check</strong></span> in the first set of functions is selected in <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic String</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot, and not the <span class="strong"><strong>Check (string)</strong></span> in the second set, called <span class="strong"><strong>Static Parameters</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_07_21.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Don't forget to set the <span class="strong"><strong>Character Limit</strong></span> value in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. In this example, we will set it to <span class="strong"><strong>3</strong></span>. As a<a id="id414" class="indexterm"></a> result, we should get something that looks like what is shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_07_22.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, everything is ready to be tested. Click on the play button to test. When the player finishes typing something in our input field, it should reset if the number of characters is less than <code class="literal">characterLimit</code>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec183"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>Like in the previous recipe, we have written a function that takes a string as a parameter. In fact, its role is to check whether the string length is less than <code class="literal">characterLimit</code>, a variable that we can set in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Then, in order to trigger this function, we created an event in the <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component. So, every time the player finishes typing, the check is performed, and if it fails, it means that the string is invalid. Then, the text of the input field is restored to an empty string. In fact, the event passes the string typed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Input Field (Script)</strong></span> component to our function. It is possible to change the action that our function takes after the check (by changing our script), and we can also adapt it to our needs.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec184"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>Giving feedback to the player is very important to let the player know what is happening and also to provide a response to his interaction within the game, albeit good or bad.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec64"></a>Giving feedback to the player on why the string is not acceptable for the input field</h4></div></div></div><p>Even though there is a clear statement that reads <span class="strong"><strong>this input field has a lower bound limit for the amount of characters that can be entered</strong></span>, which is well indicated to the player, it could<a id="id415" class="indexterm"></a> still be confusing for the player if the text that he has just written disappears after he presses <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>.</p><p>One of the options that we have is giving an error message to the player.
