For instance, 3D menus offer opportunities for UI elements to enter the game space in ways that 2D menus are unable to support. These techniques go beyond the classical UI and allow more levels of customization and player immersion within a game. In fact, a 3D UI has the potential to become very effective when animated, since we can see elements from different perspectives.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec200"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Let's start by creating an UI panel that will be the root of our menu. As we are developing our menu, it is important to keep in mind that all additional elements that we create will become children of the root element. Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, then go to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Panel </strong></span>and rename it to <span class="strong"><strong>MenuRoot</strong></span>. Of course, it is<a id="id465" class="indexterm"></a> possible to resize the image and change its other settings, such as color. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, we can make it fit the design of our game, and we can even place it wherever we want on <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, we need to add some more contents to our menu. But first, we need to have a clear idea about what our design will be. In this recipe, we are going to create a menu by following this design:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_09_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Therefore, we need to create some other panels, as we did before, and rename them to <span class="strong"><strong>TitlePanel</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>ButtonPanel1</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>ButtonPanel2</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>ButtonPanel3</strong></span>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip44"></a>Tip</h3><p>Here, we are using panels instead of the <span class="strong"><strong>Button</strong></span> component, since we are interested in<a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a> understanding how to project our menu in the 3D world rather than implementing a functional menu.</p></div></li><li><p>Right-click on each panel and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> to create a <span class="strong"><strong>Text (Script)</strong></span> component. To keep our components' names consistent, we should rename them to <span class="strong"><strong>TextTitle</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>TextButton1</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>TextButton2</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>TextButton3</strong></span>. Finally, the structure of our menu should look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_09_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, it's time to take advantage of the third dimension using the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axis. In order to see this better, we can switch to 3D view (by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> button in the upper<a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a> part of the scene view). Otherwise, we can just keep the 2D image and tweak the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axis through the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Let's slide the <span class="strong"><strong>z</strong></span> axis of <span class="strong"><strong>TitlePanel</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>-45</strong></span>. Then, we can set <span class="strong"><strong>TextTitle</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>-40</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>z</strong></span> axis. Next, we can set the buttons a little closer to the observer. Let's set them to <span class="strong"><strong>-80</strong></span> and their text to <span class="strong"><strong>-45</strong></span>. If you have already switched to 3D view, you can now see something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_09_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Thus, our menu is ready. But if we click on the play button, we don't notice any difference. This because it is still rendering as a static menu that is projected onto <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. This recipe is just an introduction, and it provides us with a foundation for the proceeding sections.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec201"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>Usually, we are bound by the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis and the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis. However, with the use of 3D, it is possible to have various UI elements projected in the third dimension, by providing values for their respective <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> axes. We have chosen negative values because we want to project them towards<a id="id468" class="indexterm"></a> the user, and by doing this, it brings them closer to the user. If we were to choose positive values, the UI elements would appear farther away from the user within the Unity scene. In fact, this will be useful in the next recipe, where the tilt effect will emphasize this effect.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec202"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>Adding shadows to our menu is a great aesthetic improvement. Thus, the following section will remind us about a component that we used in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Decorating the UI</em></span>, to quickly add shadows to improve the appearance of our menu.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec79"></a>Quick shadows</h4></div></div></div><p>We will see in the<a id="id469" class="indexterm"></a> following recipes how it is possible to move UI elements and consequently the entire menu within the scene space. Furthermore, we will look at how shadows can be incorporated as a nice addition to the aesthetics of our menu, as well as emphasize the depths of certain elements. While we can draw shadows directly on our graphics (before we export them from our graphics program), we can also add shadows quickly in Unity. To do this, we will simply use the <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow</strong></span> component that we covered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Decorating the UI</em></span>, in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding shadows to text</em></span> recipe.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec203"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you want to bring this menu to life, you will have to go on with the <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding a smooth tilt effect</em></span> recipe or the <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating and placing a 3D UI</em></span> recipe.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>For further information about the <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow UI Effect</strong></span> component, you can refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding shadows to text</em></span> recipe in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Decorating the UI</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
