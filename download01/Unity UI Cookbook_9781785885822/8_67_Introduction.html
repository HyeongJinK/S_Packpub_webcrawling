Such elements may include displaying the distance of an object, creating a radar to detect objects, as well as incorporating an inventory system and developing a subtitle shower. In this chapter, we will develop the skills required to obtain information from the 3D world and implement it as UI elements. Furthermore, through the development of a subtitle shower, you will learn how to control it from other parts of the game. Finally, as the UI reacts from input that relates to other parts of the game, we will be able to coordinate sounds related to the UI.</p></div>
