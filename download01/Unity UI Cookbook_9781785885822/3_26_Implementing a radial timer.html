The time that is remaining will be displayed as a ring that reduces circularly over time. To achieve this, we will use the <span class="strong"><strong>Image (Script)</strong></span> component, along with a script to manage the length of the circular bar. A timer like this can be useful when it is<a id="id158" class="indexterm"></a> relating to something in particular. For instance, if a character has a special ability and we want the timer to represent the duration that the ability can be used for, a radial timer can be implemented. In this way, we are able to add an icon<a id="id159" class="indexterm"></a> that then represents the ability. It can be centered in the middle of the radial timer, keeping the UI concentrated and contained.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec79"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>First of all, we need to create a circular bar for our timer. We can do this by opening a graphics program to make it, or by implementing the one that we previously created in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementing a radial heath bar</em></span> recipe in the previous chapter.</p></li><li><p>Next, import the bar into your project, and remember to set its <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> field to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> (only if the project is not in 2D) in order to use it as part of the UI <a id="id160" class="indexterm"></a>elements. Lastly, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, we need to create a new UI image. Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span>. Rename it to <span class="strong"><strong>Radial Timer</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Image (Script)</strong></span> component, we have to change <span class="strong"><strong>Image Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Filled</strong></span>. The component should change a little in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Method</strong></span> is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Radial 360</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Origin</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Since the logic is the same as that of the previous recipe, we only have to add <span class="strong"><strong>BarTimerScript</strong></span> that we created before. This is because it contains what we need. To learn how to create it, you can refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a linear timer</em></span> in the previous recipe.</p></li><li><p>After completing all of these steps, our radial timer is ready to use.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_03_03.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec80"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>First of all, you have either imported the image from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementing a radial health bar</em></span> recipe or<a id="id161" class="indexterm"></a> created a new one with a graphic program. If the project isn't in 2D, we have to set it to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>. Then, we added a new UI image to the scene; this time, we set <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Method</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Radial 360</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Origin</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom</strong></span>. We did this so that the image can disappear or appear gradually in 360 degrees in an anticlockwise direction, starting from the bottom, according to the amount of time remaining. Finally, we attached <span class="strong"><strong>BarTimerScript</strong></span> that we developed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a linear timer</em></span> recipe. It works fine, since it implements the same logic.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec81"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you want learn how to create <span class="strong"><strong>BarTimerScript</strong></span>, you can refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a linear timer</em></span> recipe</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>For different kinds of timers or countdowns, you can take a look at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementing a numeric timer</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a linear timer</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a mixed timer</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a well-formatted timer</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Developing a well-formatted countdown that changes</em></span> recipes, all contained in this chapter</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
