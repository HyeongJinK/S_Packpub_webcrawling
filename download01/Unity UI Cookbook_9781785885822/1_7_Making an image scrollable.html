This allows the player to explore the map in sections without showing it entirely at once.</p><p>This recipe explains how to achieve this using the <span class="strong"><strong>Mask (Script)</strong></span> component, which we have already used in the previous recipe, and the<span class="strong"><strong> Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component. The latter will handle the logic that will allow the UI elements to be scrollable.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec27"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>So that we don't have to start over again, we can use the mask that we created in the previous recipe. In fact, we can change what we have done there to achieve this scrollable effect.</p></li><li><p>To begin, we need to add the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component to the panel.</p></li><li><p>Keeping the panel selected, drag the image that is parented to the panel into the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> variable inside <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>By default, the image is set to have an elastic effect, which, in most cases, is quite nice. However, since we are using a circle instead of a rectangle, it is better that the image doesn't go out of the circle. This is because the image may appear distorted and affect the overall aesthetic experience, which may even prove to be uncomfortable to the player. Therefore, to solve this, change <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Clamped</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it is possible to modify the effect to better suit our needs by changing <span class="strong"><strong>Deceleration Rate</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Sensitivity</strong></span>. Thus, take time to test which values are best for you.</p></li><li><p>Once you have finished altering the values, your <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> should look similar to this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_06.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec28"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>First of all, we took<a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a> the previous image, which is already masked. In fact, scrollable images are often used along with masks. This is because masks allow us to focus on specific locations within large images or text without overwhelming the player, as well as allow larger objects to feature within the UI in more compact ways. Once we had taken the outcome from the previous recipe, we then added a <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component to the parent of our image. This component does the work, and it can be controlled by several options or parameters.</p><p>For example, we can change the <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Type</strong></span> variable. <span class="strong"><strong>Clamped</strong></span> is where the content is confined to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect</strong></span> bounds, <span class="strong"><strong>Elastic</strong></span> means the content bounds when it reaches the edge, and <span class="strong"><strong>Unrestricted</strong></span> means that there are no limitations. In addition to this, we can tweak <span class="strong"><strong>Deceleration Rate</strong></span>, but only if <span class="strong"><strong>Inertia</strong></span> is checked. This determines how much time it takes for the content to come to a complete stop. At a rate of 0, the movement will stop immediately, whereas at a rate of 1, it will never slow down. Among the most important parameters of this component is <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Sensitivity</strong></span>. This is, as the name suggests, the sensitivity when the content is scrolled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec29"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>It's always good to<a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a> refer to the official Unity documentation if you are looking for more information.
