One solution for improving the accessibility of reading text could be to add a slider so that the player can drag it in order to quickly scroll through text and immediately know which part of the text he is reading. Similar to <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>what we did in the previous recipe, we need to make this text scrollable, and we also need to add the slider, which will be vertical in this example.</p><p>By the end of this recipe, we will be able to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Scrollbar (Script)</strong></span> components to control scrollable text by using the slider.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec30"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the first step, we create a new panel within our UI. Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then go to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Panel</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Next, we should resize the panel until we have a scene view that is similar to this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>It's always good practice to have all the files within our project ordered. Hence, we can rename the panel to <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>As we did in the<a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a> last two recipes, let's add a <span class="strong"><strong>Mask (Script)</strong></span> component. In order to view the scene without visual constraints, for the moment, we can disable it.</p></li><li><p>Next, right-click on <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span> and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span>. By doing this, we create an empty child game object inside <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>. Also, we should rename it to <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>On this last one, we need to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component. Then we need to create the text. This can be done by right-clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span> and going to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now we can write (or copy and paste long text) inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> variable of the component.</p></li><li><p>Using the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Tool</strong></span>, we should resize the text area in order to obtain a rectangle. This rectangle must have a width narrower than <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span> and a larger height. We need to continue to increase its height until all of the text is contained inside of the rectangle. You can refer to the screenshot after step 10 to get a better idea of how it should appear at this stage.</p></li><li><p>Now, right-click again on <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>, and this time, go to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Scrollbar</strong></span>. Now our <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel should look similar to this one:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_07A.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Next, we need to<a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a> change the <span class="strong"><strong>Direction</strong></span> variable of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scrollbar (Script)</strong></span> component to <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom To Up</strong></span>. Then, resize and place the scroll bar in the remaining space of the panel, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_08.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We also need to link the scroll bar to the text. To do this, select <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span> and drag the scrollbar inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Vertical Scrollbar</strong></span> variable. We also have to uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal</strong></span> variable in order to force the text to scroll vertically.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we can <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>enable the mask on <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span> (the one that we have disabled in order to work better) and click on play to test what we have done. If you prefer, you can disable the elastic effect, as was done in the previous recipe. To do this, just change <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Clamped</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component.</p></li><li><p>We are now able to scroll the text within <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>. As a result, we should see something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_Extra03.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec31"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>The entire process works<a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a> in a way similar to the previous recipe. In fact, we created a mask for text, instead of images as we had previously done. Then we temporarily hid the mask, which made it easier to place the text. In order to make the text scrollable, we added a <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span>. Ultimately, we had to resize the text to display it correctly on the screen. We also added a scroll bar and linked it to <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span>. Since the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> will do the needful for us, we don't need to update the scroll bar. As in this example, the text will scroll vertically, since we have disabled horizontal scrolling on <span class="strong"><strong>Scrollbar (Script)</strong></span>. Finally, we enabled the mask again in order to show only a portion of text at once.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec32"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>The following two sections will introduce us to new ways for scrolling the text so that it can better suit the design of our game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04"></a>Scrolling multiple columns at once</h4></div></div></div><p>What happens if we want different kinds of text, such as a heading or a second column? We need to make a few changes.</p><p>First of all, we need to create a new empty game object and parent it with the <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>. Next, we add a <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component to this object and set the <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span> object that we created before in the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> variable by dragging it. Then we remove the <span class="strong"><strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong></span> component from <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span>. Lastly, we can add an arbitrary number of UI text objects inside <span class="strong"><strong>Text Content</strong></span>, and as a result, all of the text will be scrollable. If we add five of them, the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel should look like what is shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_09.jpg" /></div><p>Remember that in <a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a>order to properly place the text on the screen, we can temporarily disable the mask attached to <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span>. By doing this, we are able to see all the objects inside the mask without its constraints.</p><p>At the end, we should have something that looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_Extra04.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip08"></a>Tip</h3><p>Resizing all the components could be needed in order to fit the text and the panel properly. As a result, the scroll effect will appear natural and as we have planned.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec05"></a>Scrolling horizontally</h4></div></div></div><p>Even though using a<a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a> horizontal slider is unusual, we can transform the slider that we already have and change its orientation. This is often used to implement inventory systems of point-and-click game genres.</p><p>To achieve this, we can begin by changing what we did in step 8. This time, we have to stretch the text, making its height a little smaller than the height of <span class="strong"><strong>Text Scroller</strong></span> and the width as long as the text itself. Then, in step 10, instead to selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom To Up</strong></span>, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Direction</strong></span> variable to <span class="strong"><strong>Left To Right</strong></span>. Finally, in step 11, we need to link the <span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal Scrollbar</strong></span> variable (instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Vertical Scrollbar</strong></span>) with our scroll bar, so uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Vertical</strong></span> variable.</p><p>Since horizontal scrolling becomes hard to read when the width of the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> is large, it could be helpful to split the text into more than one column. We can easily achieve this by creating different UI text elements inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span> object and distributing them in order to form as many columns as we like. We can see an example of this in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_01_Extra05.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"></a>Tip</h3><p>Again, resizing all the<a id="id50" class="indexterm"></a> components could be needed in order to fit the text and the panel properly. As a result, the scroll effect will appear natural and as we have planned.</p></div></div></div></div>
