This could be effective if we want to create a specific type of atmosphere or emphasize an element. In fact, Unity allows us to alter UI elements by light. In this recipe, you will learn how to create two UI elements <a id="id221" class="indexterm"></a>and, using layers, how to have them affected by different lights. In order to do this, we will add two new layers, create a new UI material, and of course play with lights.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec104"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>We need to create two panels that are slightly separated, as shown in the following screenshot. From this, you can learn how to affect different UI elements with different lights. To create the panels, right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Panel</strong></span>. Furthermore, to be more ordered, we can rename them as <span class="strong"><strong>Panel01</strong></span> (the one on the left) and <span class="strong"><strong>Panel02</strong></span> (the one on the right).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_04_08.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, we have to change the render mode of our canvas. Hence, select it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, and inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Render Mode</strong></span> variable to <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>If we switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view, we will not be able to see our panels anymore. This is because we have to move our camera to frame them. To do this, we can select it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, move it in front of our panels.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip17"></a>Tip</h3><p>Switching to <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span> mode <a id="id222" class="indexterm"></a>will allow us to better observe where our camera is placed. To do this, uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> icon at the top of your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_04_09.jpg" /></div><p>In the end, we should have something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_04_10.jpg" /></div></div></li><li><p>Now select one of the two panels and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Layer</strong></span> at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> should change. If this is a new project, we can add two different layers onto <span class="strong"><strong>User Layer 8</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>User Layer 9</strong></span> by typing the names of the new layers next to them. In this case, we can call them <span class="strong"><strong>UI1</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>UI2</strong></span>. So, we should see something like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785885822/graphics/B04903_04_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Panel01</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI1</strong></span>. Then select <span class="strong"><strong>Panel02</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI2</strong></span>. By doing this, we have put the panels on different layers.</p></li><li><p>The next step is to create a new UI material to allow our panel to be affected by light. In order to do so, right-click somewhere in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>, and rename it to <span class="strong"><strong>UIMaterial</strong></span>. Select it, and in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Lit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Detail</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Panel01</strong></span> along with <span class="strong"><strong>Panel02</strong></span> and drag and drop <span class="strong"><strong>UIMaterial</strong></span> inside the <span class="strong"><strong>material</strong></span> variable in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now we can create a light; right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then on <span class="strong"><strong>Light</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Point Light</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We can change the<a id="id223" class="indexterm"></a> light as we want, but let's ensure that in <span class="strong"><strong>Culling Mask</strong></span>, only one layer is selected (<span class="strong"><strong>UI1</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>UI2</strong></span>), and that the range of the light is very long (maybe around <code class="literal">2000</code>). We do this so that we can see the effect on our panels. Lastly, we can place the light wherever we want it.</p></li><li><p>We can create as many lights as we wish and then decide which panel to affect by changing its <span class="strong"><strong>Culling Mask</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec105"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity allows us to cause UI elements to be affected by lights, but they must be in <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> and must have the right material. This is because lights belong to the 3D world, and so the UI also needs to stay there. Furthermore, it also needs a material that can respond to lights. In fact, we have created a material so that our panels can be affected by lights. Additionally, we have created different layers so that we can affect only some UI elements by a certain light.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec106"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>It could be great if we can make interactive lights. This will increase the realism of the lights and thus also enhance how the player perceives the UI. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a slider that changes colors gradually</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating sliders that change single channels of a light</em></span> recipes in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Applying Runtime Customizations</em></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Furthermore, using light becomes very easy when all of the system is integrated in a 3D UI. In fact, when the UI moves into the third dimension, we can see the reflection, the position, or other effects of the lights changing. Therefore, to increase the visual impact in this recipe, you should integrate with the recipes contained in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Diving into 3D UIs</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
