In addition to these, we covered a lot of features that exist in Unity for you to be able to use in your own future projects. We specifically covered placing turrets, integrating RAIN in our project, integrating Shooter AI in our project, spawning enemies using triggers, placing pickups and healthpacks, and so on. Keeping all this in mind, in the next chapter, we'll learn how to take our knowledge of environments and build different combat scenarios!</p></div>
