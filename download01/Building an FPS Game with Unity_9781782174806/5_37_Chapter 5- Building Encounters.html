In this chapter, we are going to learn how to create various types of encounters in order to generate effective gameplay scenarios.</p><p>Now, as a level designer and/or scripter for a project, you'll often need to implement various encounters that a player will need to go through in the project. There are way too many possibilities for encounters to cover here, but I'll go into some of the most common ones that you'll often see in an FPS.</p><p>This project will be split into a number of tasks. It will be a simple step-by-step process from the beginning to the end. Here is an outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding a simple turret enemy</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Integrating an AI system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up enemy characters</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Spawning a group of enemies with the help of a trigger</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Cleaning up dead AI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Placing ammo/healthpacks</p></li></ul></div></div>
