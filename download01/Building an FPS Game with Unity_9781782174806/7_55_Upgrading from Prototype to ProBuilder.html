Thankfully, there is a tool that can act as a intermediate stage and that will save all of the data needed so we won't have to redo everything. So let's learn how to go about doing it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note69"></a>Note</h3><p>Before continuing, I do want to mention that the upgrade process is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> reversible, and if an error occurs, you will almost certainly lose all your work. Make a backup of your entire project before attempting to do this!</p><p>It's also important to note if you are using ProBuilder Basic and updating to Advanced and are using 2.4.7 or higher, all you need to do is import your new package. </p><p>To be completely sure of the steps needed and what to do for whatever version of the tools you're using check out the following page: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/docs/probuilder/#installingAndUpgrading" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/docs/probuilder/#installingAndUpgrading</a>
</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To start off we will need to go to the ProBuilder site to download a new Unity package called the <span class="strong"><strong>ProBuilder Upgrade Kit</strong></span>. To do that open up your web browser and visit: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/docs/probuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/docs/probuilder/ProBuilderUpgradeKit.html</a>.</p></li><li><p>From there click on the <span class="strong"><strong>ProBuilder Upgrade Kit</strong></span> link to download the package, clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> once you get to the Dropbox file.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once it's finished downloading, open up your Unity project (making sure to back up <a id="id456" class="indexterm"></a>your previous one first), then go to the top bar, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Packageâ€¦</strong></span> Then browse to your <code class="literal">Downloads</code> folder to select the <code class="literal">ProBuilderUpgradeKit.unitypackage</code> file.</p></li><li><p>Once it comes up, verify that everything is checked and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Next, open up each scene in your project that uses Prototype and then go to the top bar and select <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prototype</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Upgrade</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prepare Scene for Upgrade</strong></span>. It will bring up a popup saying that it will store the data and remove the old content. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Okay</strong></span> button:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once it <a id="id457" class="indexterm"></a>finishes, another popup will appear saying that it successfully serialized the objects. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save Scene</strong></span> button and then do this again for every other level.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_04.jpg" /></div><p>If you look at the scene, you'll notice that the Prototype components have been replaced with a new <code class="literal">Pb_Serialized Component (Script)</code> component. This is the data needed by ProBuilder to recreate your scene with the new functionality built in and ensures we can remove Prototype safely.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now that <a id="id458" class="indexterm"></a>all of the objects in all scenes are fixed, we can delete Prototype from our project. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>tab, select the <code class="literal">ProCore</code> folder and then delete it. At this point your screen may look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_06.jpg" /></div><p>You <a id="id459" class="indexterm"></a>may also see some errors on the console. This is perfectly normal and expected because some of the data is no longer there.</p></li><li><p>Now we need to get ProBuilder, so let's go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> by going to the top bar and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>. Log in as discussed before, search for <code class="literal">ProBuilder</code>, and select <span class="strong"><strong>ProBuilder 2</strong></span>. Purchase the asset if you haven't already, and once finished download the asset.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, <a id="id460" class="indexterm"></a>when the popup starts up click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button to bring it in.</p></li><li><p>Now that we have ProBuilder completed, we need to go through all of our scenes; from the top bar select <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>ProBuilder</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Upgrade</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Re-attach ProBuilder Scripts</strong></span>. You should notice everything going back to normal and if you select an object you'll know everything has gone correctly if you see there is a <code class="literal">Pb_Object</code> component with <span class="strong"><strong>Open ProBuilder</strong></span> as an option.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_08.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>In levels <a id="id461" class="indexterm"></a>where you have special properties such as Triggers, Colliders, and Movers, everything will work correctly when you play the game, but in the Editor mode the materials may be the normal colliders instead of the special ones from Prototype. To fix this, after conversion you may need to select the object again; from <span class="strong"><strong>Object </strong></span>mode, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Set Trigger</strong></span> (or whatever it is) option once more and save the level.</p></li><li><p>Once you are finished with all of the scenes, you can then optionally delete the <code class="literal">ProBuilderUpgradeKit</code> folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note70"></a>Note</h3><p>If you do delete the folder and there is a scene that hasn't been converted then you'll lose all that data, so be very careful!</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_09.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>And with that, we <a id="id462" class="indexterm"></a>have ProBuilder completely installed!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note71"></a>Note</h3><p>For another video example of the upgrading process, check out: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Dz0Q3KgCs&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-Dz0Q3KgCs&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>.</p></div></div>
