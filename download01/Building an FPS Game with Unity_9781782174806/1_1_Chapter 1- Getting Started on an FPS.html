This chapter is dedicated to offer a brief overview, from a beginner's point of view, of the exciting world of Unity development for the creation of a <a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>First Person Shooter (FPS)</strong></span> title, leveraging the powerful <span class="strong"><strong>Ultimate First Person Shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UFPS</strong></span>)<a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a> framework by VisionPunk and Prototype/ProBuilder 2.0 by ProCore3D. But, before we get started, we first need to get all of the resources we'll need and set up our project for success.</p><p>Over the course of this book, we will be creating a 3D FPS game similar to the popular games in the market such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Halo 5: Guardians</em></span>.</p><p>We will learn how we can create custom weapons of our own as well as how we can create interior and exterior environments. After creating our environments, we will populate them with different combat encounters for players to fight as well as include intractable objects such as exploding barrels. We'll then customize our user interface using Unity's new GUI system before we package our game and create an installer to get the game out into the world!</p><p>This project will be split into a number of tasks. It will be a simple step-by-step process from the beginning to the end. Here is the outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Project creation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Getting started with Unity's Asset Store</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Installing UFPS</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Installing Prototype</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>File organization</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Customizing Unity's layout</p></li></ul></div></div>
