<span class="strong"><strong>level designer</strong></span>.</p><p>An environment artist is the person who builds the assets to go into the environment. They use tools such as 3ds Max or Maya to create the model and then use other tools like Photoshop to create textures and normal maps.</p><p>The level designer is responsible for assembling the assets that an environment artist creates in an environment for players to enjoy. They design the gameplay elements, create the scripted events, and test the gameplay. Typically, a level designer will create environments through a combination of scripting and use some tools that may be in development. In our case, that tool is <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>One thing that is important to note is that most companies have their own definition for different roles. In some companies, a level designer may need to create assets and an environment artist may need to create a level layout. There are also some places that hire someone just for lighting or to place meshes (called a <span class="strong"><strong>mesher</strong></span>) because<a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a> they're so good at it.</p></div><p>In this chapter, we take on the role of a level designer who has been tasked to create a level prototype to <a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a>prove that our gameplay is solid. We will use the free tool <a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a>Prototype to help in this endeavor. In addition, you will also learn some of the basics of level designing.</p><p>This project will be split into a number of tasks. It will be a simple step-by-step process from the beginning to the end. Here is the outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating geometry—building a room</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building a doorway</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Duplicating rooms / creating a hallway</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Preventing falls—collision</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding stairways</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Coloring your world</p></li></ul></div></div>
