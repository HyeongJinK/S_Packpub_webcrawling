<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec61"></a>Creating a main menu: part 1 â€“ adding text</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Games <a id="id543" class="indexterm"></a>don't just launch straight into the gameplay. Generally they start off with some kind of Title Screen with the game's name and the option for you to play or quit. This will be a good way to get some familiarity with how the new Unity GUI system (as of Unity 4.6) works with some simple UI elements. To start off, let's add some descriptive text that will display our game's name.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To start off we will need to create a new level for our main menu to exist in, so to do that go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Scene</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now we could add objects into this level, but for our purposes let's make it blank. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, select the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code> object, under <span class="strong"><strong>Clear Flags</strong></span> select <code class="literal">Solid Color</code>, and then under <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> change the color to black.</p></li><li><p>In order to create a GUI we need to have something called a Canvas in our scene, so to do this, we need to go to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_08_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>It may be hard to see the object at this point, so let's go into 2D mode. We can do that by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> button below the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab.</p><p>You'll notice that now when we double-click it becomes a lot easier to see what's there because we're viewing the scene in an orthographic way, or straight-on like a 2D game would be. Of course, 3D interfaces are also popular, but in that case you'll be moving around just like a normal <a id="id544" class="indexterm"></a>object in 3D space.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_08_02.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> acts as a space in which we can place different UI elements in the<a id="id545" class="indexterm"></a> scene. It can either be drawn on top of the game like we will be doing here, or it can actually be placed inside the game world, leading to cool effects.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note78"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information <a id="id546" class="indexterm"></a>on the canvas, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UICanvas.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UICanvas.html</a>
</p></div><p>You'll also notice that another object was created, <span class="strong"><strong>EventSystem</strong></span>, which will allow us to interact with the UI we'll learn about later.</p><p>It's important to note that UI elements will only show up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> if they are a child of a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> object.</p></li><li><p>Next let's<a id="id547" class="indexterm"></a> add some text for our game. With our Canvas object selected from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, from the top toolbar click on <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, select the newly created <code class="literal">Text</code> object and then, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab, change its name to <code class="literal">GameTitle</code>. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> values to <code class="literal">0</code> by either typing them in or right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Component</strong></span>.</p><p>You may have noticed that this object doesn't have a Transform component in the Inspector. In its place we have <a id="id548" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>. This transform has a number of new properties designed for working with UIs, such as pivots to dictate which directions the UI can scale from as well as Anchors to hold the object at a certain place within the scene. This is very useful in terms of creating UIs because we want to be able to support many different resolutions and have it work correctly. We'll discuss these properties in more detail as they come up in this chapter.</p></li><li><p>Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> property to your game's name (I used <code class="literal">Awesome FPS Game</code>) and in the <span class="strong"><strong>Paragraph</strong></span> section change the Alignment to <span class="strong"><strong>Center Align</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Middle Align</strong></span> (the center of the choices).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_08_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We're <a id="id549" class="indexterm"></a>making progress, but now let's make the text larger. Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> to <code class="literal">32</code> and you'll notice it disappears; that's because our width and height are too small for this element. Back in the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> to <code class="literal">350</code> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> to <code class="literal">60</code>.</p></li><li><p>Our background is currently black so let's change the text's color as well. Back in the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component change the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> property to white.</p></li><li><p>We can also change the font to whatever we'd like as well. UFPS comes with a font, so let's just use it. Click on the circle icon to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Font</strong></span> property and select <code class="literal">Aldrich-Regular</code> from the list that pops up.</p><p>You can also drag-and-drop any font file you have on your computer into the Unity project and use it as well!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_08_04.jpg" /></div><p>Okay, we're starting to make headway. Let's move it up as well.</p></li><li><p>Back in the <a id="id550" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> section's <span class="strong"><strong>Min</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max Y</strong></span> values to <code class="literal">.75</code>.</p><p>Notice that the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> value goes from <code class="literal">0</code> to a negative number. This is saying that the text is a certain number of pixels away from being 75% up to the top of the screen.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> are convenient because, when working with larger or smaller resolutions, objects will stay in the same relative positions in space, even if we change the aspect ratio. Depending on what the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> variables are set to, <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> will show different variables to allow you to position your object.</p><p>If you set <span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> to a single point, without stretching, you'll see the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> Properties, like we have currently.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note79"></a>Note</h3><p>In code, the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> values are stored in a variable known as <code class="literal">anchoredPosition</code>, which may be a more appropriate name for them.</p></div><p>However, if <a id="id551" class="indexterm"></a>you set Anchors in a way that stretches your UI Element, you'll get <span class="strong"><strong>Left</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Right</strong></span> and/or <span class="strong"><strong>Top</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom</strong></span>. To set your anchors easily, there are a number of presets which you can access from the button in the top left of the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component. In addition to that, if you click on one of the buttons while holding <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> it will automatically move the object selected as well.</p><p>Do note that, when you change the value, it doesn't actually move the object as it adjusts the position to put it in the same place; with that in mind, you'll still need to set the position.</p></li><li><p>Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">0</code> and you'll see that now the value is higher!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_08_05.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>And with that we <a id="id552" class="indexterm"></a>now have a clean logo for our project!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note80"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information about the <a id="id553" class="indexterm"></a>Text component, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Text.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Text.html</a>
