Move the newly created <a id="id139" class="indexterm"></a>folder to the <code class="literal">MyGame</code> folder we created previously and double-click on the folder to enter it.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you are in the Object/Top Level mode and then select the <span class="strong"><strong>Simple Room</strong></span> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab. Drag and drop it into our <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab. You'll notice that the object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab will turn blue to indicate that it is a prefab.</p><p>Prefabs or the prefabricated objects are the objects we set aside to make copies of during runtime, such as <code class="literal">AdvancedPlayer</code> we used previously from UFPS. With this blueprint, we can create as many as we want. When you add a <code class="literal">Prefab</code> folder to a scene, you will create an instance of it. All of these instances are clones of the object located in our Assets. Whenever you change something in the prefab located in the <code class="literal">Prefab</code> folder, the changes are applied to all of the objects that are already inside the scene. For example, if you add a new component to a Prefab, all of the other objects we have in the scene will instantly contain the component as well. However, it is also possible to change the properties of a single instance while keeping the link intact. Simply change any property of a prefab instance inside your Scene and that particular value will be bolded to show that the value is overridden; they will not be affected by the changes in the source Prefab. This allows you to modify the Prefab instances to make them unique from their source Prefabs without breaking the Prefab link.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_03_25.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>After this, drag <a id="id140" class="indexterm"></a>and drop one of the prefabs into the level, setting<a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> values to be similar to the original room to make it easier for us to line it up later.</p></li><li><p>Drag the object over to be away from the old room (I used a <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> value of -<code class="literal">21</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">7</code>).
