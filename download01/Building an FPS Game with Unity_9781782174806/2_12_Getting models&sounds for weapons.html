Of course, you<a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a> could model them yourselves, but it would require modeling knowledge (and the knowledge of using 3D modeling software such as Blender, Autodesk's Maya, or 3ds Studio Max), which is out of the scope of this book. For simplicity, we are going to use some free assets that you can obtain from the Asset Store.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>If you would like to build a gun of your very own, some information on making the model set up for UFPS can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.visionpunk.com/hub/assets/ufps/manual/weapons" target="_blank">http://www.visionpunk.com/hub/assets/ufps/manual/weapons</a>.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To open the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> inside Unity, we can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store </strong></span>from the top toolbar.</p></li><li><p>If you aren't already logged in, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Log In</strong></span> from the top-right corner of the panel and enter the information that you put in when you created the account.</p></li><li><p>From the right-hand side menu, go to <span class="strong"><strong>3D Models</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Props</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Weapons</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Guns</strong></span> and select a weapon that you'd like.
