This <a id="id396" class="indexterm"></a>adds realism to our world, but it's still very computationally expensive to have them around. Thankfully, we can add another component to make it quite easy for us to clean up enemies of our choice.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, open the <code class="literal">MyGame/Prefabs</code> folder and select the <code class="literal">UFPS_Enemy</code> that we created earlier.</p></li><li><p>From the Inspector tab, scroll all the way down and press the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> button.
