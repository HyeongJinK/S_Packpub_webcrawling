If, for some reason, your layout does not look like the earlier screenshot, you can reset it by going to the top-right corner of the window and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span>.</p><p>You can customize the layout by clicking and dragging any tab to wherever you want it to be. There are also additional options such as making the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab use a one-column layout by right-clicking on the tab and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>One Column Layout</strong></span>. Sometimes, I like to split the center with the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab on one side and the <span class="strong"><strong>Game </strong></span>tab on the other, so I can see how things change from a different angle. For those of you with multiple monitors, you may use a monitor just for the game. It's all up to your preferences, but keep your changes in mind, as I'll assume that you'll be using <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on customizing your Unity layout, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomizingYourWorkspace.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomizingYourWorkspace.html</a>.</p></div></div>
