As your project moves from a small prototype to a full game, more and more files will be introduced to your project. If you don't start organizing it from the beginning and keep planning to tidy it up later on, things may get quite out of hand as the deadlines keep coming.</p><p>Setting up a project <a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a>structure at the start and sticking to it will save you countless minutes in the long run. It will only take a few seconds and is what we'll be doing now.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>tab in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Once there, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> drop-down menu. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span> and you'll notice that a new folder has been created inside your Assets folder.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"></a>Tip</h3><p>Similarly, you can right-click on the negative space within the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>window to create a folder.</p></div></li><li><p>After the folder is created, you can type in the name of your folder. Once it is named, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>. Let's now create a folder called <code class="literal">MyGame</code>. We also need to create folders for the following directories inside the <code class="literal">MyGame</code> folder:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Prefabs</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Scenes</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Scripts</code>
</p></li></ul></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>If you happen to create a folder inside another folder, you can simply drag and drop it from the left toolbar. If you need to rename a folder, just simply click on it once and wait, you'll be able to edit it again. Alternatively, on the keyboard you can press <span class="emphasis"><em>F2</em></span>.</p></div><p>Your project should now look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_13.jpg" /></div></div>
