It can give you a sense of accomplishment; I know, I felt that way the first time I pushed a build to a console development kit. </p><p>No matter what platform we wish to create out game for in order to build it we need to go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In order to access <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>, we will need to go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the top menu (or by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_09_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once you're <a id="id581" class="indexterm"></a>ready, select <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> from the bottom-left <a id="id582" class="indexterm"></a>menu. The Unity logo will show the one you're currently compiling for. We're going to compile for Windows now, so if it is currently not set to <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span>, select it and press the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>Once you have all of this set up, press the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button. It will ask you for a name and a location<a id="id583" class="indexterm"></a> to place the game. I'm going to name <a id="id584" class="indexterm"></a>it <code class="literal">FPSGame</code> and put it in an <code class="literal">Export</code> folder located in the same directory as the <code class="literal">Assets</code> and <code class="literal">Library</code> folders. Afterward, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_09_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You may need to wait a bit, but as soon as it finishes, it will open up the folder with your new game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_09_03.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>While building for<a id="id585" class="indexterm"></a> Windows, you should get something like the preceding <a id="id586" class="indexterm"></a>screenshot. We have the executable, but we also have a <code class="literal">Data</code> folder that contains all of the assets for our application (right now called <code class="literal">FPSGame_Data</code>). You must include the <code class="literal">Data</code> folder with your game or it will not run. This is troublesome; but later on in this chapter, will create an installer that will put it on a computer without any hassle.</p><p>If you build for Mac, it will bundle the app and data together. So, once you export it, all you need to give people is the application.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note84"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are interested in submitting your Mac game to the<a id="id587" class="indexterm"></a> Mac App Store, there is a nice tutorial on how to do it at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html" target="_blank">http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html</a>.</p></div><p>If you double-click on the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file in order to run the game, you'll see the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_09_04.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, the <a id="id588" class="indexterm"></a>game pops <a id="id589" class="indexterm"></a>up and we can play it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note85"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on publishing<a id="id590" class="indexterm"></a> and the specific things to look out for, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html</a>.</p></div></div>
