Thankfully, it's very easy to add textures to everything. But first, we need to have <a id="id196" class="indexterm"></a>some textures to paint onto the world and, for this instance, we will make use of some of the free assets that Unity provides us with. To make use of these assets perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To download it, we'll use the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> again. So, with this in mind, select <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In the top-right corner of the screen, you'll see a search bar where you can type in <code class="literal">Terrain assets</code> and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>. Once there, the first asset you'll see is <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Assets</strong></span> that is released by <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Technologies</strong></span> for free. Click on it and then once in the menu, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once it finishes downloading, you should see the <span class="strong"><strong>Importing package</strong></span> dialogue box <a id="id197" class="indexterm"></a>popup (if it doesn't pop up, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button, where the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button used to be).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_08.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Generally, you'll want to select only the assets that you want to use and uncheck the others. But since you're exploring the tools right now, we'll just click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button to place them all.</p></li><li><p>Close the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> if it's still opened and go back to our <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view. You should notice the new <code class="literal">Terrain Assets</code> folder placed in our <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder. Double-click on it and then enter the <code class="literal">Textures</code> folder.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_09.jpg" /></div><p>These will be the textures we will be placing in our environment.</p></li><li><p>Select the <a id="id198" class="indexterm"></a>Terrain object and click on the fourth button from the left (that looks like a paint brush) to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Texture</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_31.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Here on, you'll notice that it looks quite similar to the previous sections we've seen. If you look under the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Assets</strong></span> section for <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span>, you will notice that it says <span class="strong"><strong>No Terrain textures defined</strong></span>. So, let's fix this. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Textures</strong></span> button and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>You'll see an <span class="strong"><strong>Add Terrain Texture</strong></span> dialogue popup. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo (RGB)</strong></span> variable, place the <span class="strong"><strong>Grass (Hill)</strong></span> texture (use the search dialog) and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_10.jpg" /></div><p>The<a id="id199" class="indexterm"></a> left texture slot labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo (RGB) Smoothness (A)</strong></span> is just a complex way of saying diffuse/color map. <span class="strong"><strong>RGB</strong></span> stands for the colors red, green, and blue and <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> stands for Alpha. This texture slot has the ability to provide color and opacity to a texture, which is usually saved in a separate channel within the image file. Grass and shrubs in videogames frequently have alphas within their color/diffuse maps to create an illusion that they aren't a bunch of planes with a texture slapped on.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Normal</strong></span> map slot to the right is generally used in tandem with colored maps. It uses brightly colored RGB information to give more realism and depth to a color texture. We will be using these more later on in the book.</p><p>At this point, you should see the entire world change to green if you're far away. If you zoom in, you'll see that now the entire Terrain is using the <span class="strong"><strong>Grass (Hill)</strong></span> texture.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, we <a id="id200" class="indexterm"></a>don't just want the entire world to have grass. We will next be adding cliffs around the edges where the water is. To do this, we will add an additional texture by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Textures...</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Cliff (Layered Rock)</strong></span> as <span class="strong"><strong>Texture </strong></span>and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>. Now, if you select <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab, you should see two textures. With the <span class="strong"><strong>Cliff</strong></span> texture selected, paint the edges of the moat by clicking and holding the mouse, modifying the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> value as needed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_12.jpg" /></div><p>You may <a id="id201" class="indexterm"></a>also spend time painting the mountains on the outside of the area to create a nicer looking environment such as the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_32.jpg" /></div><p>Now, it's <a id="id202" class="indexterm"></a>starting to look really nice. But if we play the game and look at the ground, at a distance, you will see some repetitiveness in the textures.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_13.jpg" /></div><p>Thankfully, Unity has some things we can do in order to break up this monotony, namely that we can mix the textures.</p></li><li><p>To <a id="id203" class="indexterm"></a>reduce the appearance of texture duplication, we can introduce new materials with a very soft opacity that we will place in patches in the areas where there is just plain ground. For example, let's create a new texture with the <span class="strong"><strong>Grass (Meadow)</strong></span> texture. Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">16 </code>and the <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> value to something really low, like <code class="literal">6</code>, and then start painting in the areas that look too static. Feel free to select the first brush again to have a smoother touch up.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_33.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, suppose we were to zoom into the world as if we were a character there. I can <a id="id204" class="indexterm"></a>tell that the first grass texture is way too big for the environment, but this can be changed very easily. Double-click on the texture to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> to <code class="literal">(8,8)</code>. This will make the texture smaller before it duplicates. It's a good idea to have different textures with different sizes so that the seams of each texture aren't visible to others.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_14.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>As you can see, it <a id="id205" class="indexterm"></a>already looks a lot nicer in the scene, but as it stands, it's just a couple of hills without much else to guide the player. To really add to the high quality of this level, we're going to need to add in some additional features to make it appear like a real place.</p></div>
