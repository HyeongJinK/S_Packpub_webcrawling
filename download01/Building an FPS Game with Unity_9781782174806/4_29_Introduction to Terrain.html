<span class="strong"><strong>Terrain </strong></span>is <a id="id174" class="indexterm"></a>basically<a id="id175" class="indexterm"></a> anything that is nonman-made such as hills, deserts, mountains, and so on. Unity's way of dealing with Terrains is different than what most engines do in the fact that there are two ways to make them, one being to use a height map and the other being to sculpt from scratch.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec11"></a>Height maps</h3></div></div></div><p>Height maps <a id="id176" class="indexterm"></a>are a common way for game engines to support Terrain. Rather than creating tools to build Terrain within the level, the artist/designer can use a graphic designing software (such as Adobe Photoshop) to create a greyscale image. These values are then interpreted by the software to calculate its dimensional height based on lightness or darkness. We can translate the image into a Terrain by using this height map.</p><p>We've already seen an example of a height map in <code class="literal">CleanScene</code> that we used in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building Custom Weapons</em></span>. You'll notice that there is an object called <code class="literal">Terrain</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab. This object encompasses all the bumps and hills within the scene.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>In the <code class="literal">UFPS/Base/Content/Levels/CleanScene/Terrain </code>folder, you'll notice that there is a file called <code class="literal">Heightmap</code>, which is of the RAW type. Unity can load this data in and produce the following hills scene. If we were to open this file in Adobe Photoshop, it would appear like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_02.jpg" /></div><p>The lighter <a id="id177" class="indexterm"></a>values of the colors within <span class="strong"><strong>HeightMap</strong></span> are calculated to make the Terrain taller in 3D space, and dark grey or black values are calculated to push the Terrain lower in 3D space. Generally speaking, black is the lowest and white is the highest in terms of creating the altitude of our Terrain.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note35"></a>Note</h3><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Height</strong></span> property sets how high white actually is in comparison to black.</p></div><p>In order to apply a height map to a Terrain object, inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> component, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> button and scroll down to <span class="strong"><strong>Import Rawâ€¦</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_29.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note36"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on Unity's Height tools, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-Height.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-Height.html</a>.</p><p>If you want to learn more about creating your own HeightMaps using Photoshop, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://worldofleveldesign.com/categories/udk/udk-landscape-heightmaps-photoshop-clouds-filter.php" target="_blank">http://worldofleveldesign.com/categories/udk/udk-landscape-heightmaps-photoshop-clouds-filter.php</a>.
