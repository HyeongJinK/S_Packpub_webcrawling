<span class="strong"><strong>PlayerSettings</strong></span> is actually shown in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. There are some key properties at the top that are cross-platform, which means that they will apply to all platforms (or rather will be the defaults you can override later).</p></li><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, create a new folder within the <code class="literal">MyGame</code> folder and name it <code class="literal">Sprites</code>.</p></li><li><p>Now, in the <code class="literal">Example Code</code> folder, you'll find a <code class="literal">cursor_hand</code> image. Drag and drop it to the <code class="literal">Assets/MyGame/Sprites</code> folder of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> browser. Once there, select the image and change <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Cursor</strong></span>.</p><p>Note that, while the image I created works, you're more than welcome to create your own cursor and put it here to suit your particular game.</p></li><li><p>Then, in <a id="id593" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span>, drag and drop the <a id="id594" class="indexterm"></a>cursor image into <span class="strong"><strong>Default Cursor</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Default Icon</strong></span> to the <code class="literal">MachinegunBullet64x64</code> image that is located in the <code class="literal">Assets/UFPS/Base/Content/GUI/HUD</code>.</p><p>If you would like your game to have multiple cursors or change cursors at runtime, the <code class="literal">Cursor.SetCursor</code> function<a id="id595" class="indexterm"></a> would be quite helpful.

If you want to keep it hidden, skip this step, since it's disabled by one of the assets we've imported. Otherwise, open the <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution and Presentation</strong></span> section and, under <span class="strong"><strong>Standalone Player Options</strong></span>, set <span class="strong"><strong>Display Resolution Dialog</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Enabled</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>With this finished, go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project</strong></span> and build the game once more, overwriting the previously created one.</p></li></ol></div><p>Depending on your <a id="id600" class="indexterm"></a>choices, you'll either see the game again or you'll see the<a id="id601" class="indexterm"></a> following menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_09_07.jpg" /></div><p>We can see that it has been modified with the image we created and a cursor showing up on the main menu and whenever we're not in the main game.</p><p>The game already looks much better and more polished than before. There are a number of other things you can do like restrict the kind of aspect ratios your game runs on or its resolution, or force windowed or full screen.
