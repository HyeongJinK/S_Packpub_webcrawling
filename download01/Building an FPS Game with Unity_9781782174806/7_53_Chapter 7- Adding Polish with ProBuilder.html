This has been great, but when we want to start building professional-quality levels, we need to start adding more details such as textures to the level.</p><p>Different companies and game engines deal with this in different ways. Some will take their prototyped levels and then export them to a file to bring them into a 3D modeling tool, such as 3dsMax or Maya, to create their environment, often converting the original brushes into colliders. Other companies will instead refine their prototypes, add in more details, and then add materials to the brushes that were created; this is the approach that we are going to use.</p><p>Now, Prototype doesn't come with this feature, but its ProBuilder tool does. In this chapter we are going to explore how to use this tool to create the best levels that we can.</p><p>Here is an outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Upgrading from Prototype to ProBuilder</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with ProBuilder—placing materials and UVs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Meshing your levels</p></li></ul></div></div>
