We've got a nice foundation to build upon, but it's pretty barren. We can't use textures yet, as it's a ProBuilder-only tool. But we can apply colors to our walls to help differentiate <a id="id168" class="indexterm"></a>the areas. Let's see how we can do this now.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go back to our first room and select the top section of our doorway walls. Then, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Vertex Colors</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Prototype</strong></span> tab.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_03_43.jpg" /></div><p>This will bring up an example number of colors, but we can customize them by clicking on the bottom section.</p></li><li><p>Now, with the faces selected, click on the blue button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_03_44.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>With this, we<a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a> have some color. Let's add some color to the other room from the outside. Select the sides and top of the room and click on the red button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_03_45.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Then, do<a id="id170" class="indexterm"></a> the same to the other sides for both of the changes we made.</p></li><li><p>Save the level and start the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_03_46.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>There, we <a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a>have it! This was a simple example; as you build your levels in the future, this can be a good way to help players mark certain areas or help break issues with only using white. However, you'll need to extrude the faces you want to color, unless you want the entire wall to be colored!</p></div>
