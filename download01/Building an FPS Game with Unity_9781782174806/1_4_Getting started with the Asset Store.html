We will be using this in our project; but, before we do so, we will need to have an account, that can be created using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To open the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> via Unity, we can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Window | Asset Store </strong></span>from the top toolbar.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>You may also open the panel by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>9</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>9</em></span> on Mac). If nothing happens, make sure Unity is focused on window by clicking on the program and trying again. If you prefer working outside Unity, you may also go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> website at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/</a>. However, you'll need to download assets from Unity via the <span class="strong"><strong>Download Manager</strong></span>, which you can learn about from the link given later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_06.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Next, go to<a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a> the top-right corner of the panel and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Account</strong></span> button. Fill out your information and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create account</strong></span> at the bottom of the screen.</p></li><li><p>You should receive an activation e-mail shortly after you submit the form. Open it and click on the activation link provided to verify your account.</p></li><li><p>Once this is done, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Log In</strong></span> from the top-right corner of the panel and enter the information you put in when you created the account. If all goes well, the top-right corner of the window will change to reflect that you are logged in.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_07.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>With this, we can<a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a> download and purchase assets from the Asset Store!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>Do not be concerned if you do not see <span class="strong"><strong>11</strong></span> by your account, it just shows that I have a Unity Pro account.</p><p>For more information on the Asset Store and how to navigate using it, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AccessNavigation.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AccessNavigation.html</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"></a>Installing UFPS</h3></div></div></div><p>Creating a <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>game completely from scratch takes a considerable amount of time. Creating a first-person shooter relies on having a lot of knowledge as well as problem solving with things such as physics, mathematics, graphics, and programming. Now, books of each of these subjects could have been written based on it; but we are assuming that you want results in the fastest amount of time possible.</p><p>Rather than taking<a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a> the tens of thousands of hours it would take to create it from scratch, we will leverage the very popular Unity add-on UFPS (Ultimate FPS) from VisionPunk. It will give us a solid foundation to create our own project with hundreds of parameters, which we can customize to create a project exactly the way we want it to be.</p><p>It's important to note that UFPS does cost money. But considering that a solid game programmer generally makes $50 or more an hour, the amount of time saved really makes it a worthwhile investment.</p><p>Now that we are logged into the Asset Store, let's purchase and install UFPS:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Now, from the search bar directly below the login information, search for <code class="literal">UFPS</code>. You should see an icon that looks similar to the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_14.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on the first option, which will bring you to the following page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_08.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, click<a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Buy</strong></span> button and purchase the asset. Once it is purchased, the screen will change the <span class="strong"><strong>Buy</strong></span> button to a <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button. You can click on it to download the asset and bring it into your project.</p></li><li><p>Once it is downloaded, an <span class="strong"><strong>Importing package</strong></span> window will open, giving you the option to choose which parts of the package you wish to import. We want everything, so just click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_09.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>If, for some reason, you get an error (the bottom bar, or Console, in the Unity interface) while importing that says something like <code class="literal">'Fatal error! getManagerFromContext:â€¦"</code>. This is a bug in Unity due to the large file size UFPS has. Just <span class="strong"><strong>Quit</strong></span> and continue with the import once again, when you restart Unity.</p></div></li><li><p>Once the<a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a> project is imported, close the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window and go back into the Unity Editor. From there, go down to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab in the bottom-left corner of the screen and double-click on the <code class="literal">UFPS</code> folder. Go to <code class="literal">Base\Content\Levels\SkyCity</code> and double-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>SkyCity</strong></span> file to open an example level. Then, press the Play button at the top-center of the project to start the project!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_10.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>With this, we know that UFPS is installed correctly!</p></div></div>
