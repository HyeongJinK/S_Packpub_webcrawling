You've actually been using a GUI in the previous chapter, and also when you interact with your operating system of choice. Without a GUI of some sort, you wouldn't be able to make your electronics do anything (apart from by using a command prompt, as in DOS and UNIX).</p><p>When <a id="id541" class="indexterm"></a>working on GUIs we want them to be as intuitive as possible and only contain the information that is pertinent to the player at any given time. There are people whose entire job is programming and/or designing user interfaces and colleges provide degrees on the subject. Thus, while we won't talk about everything having to do with working on GUIs, I do want to touch on aspects that should be quite helpful when working on your own projects in the future.</p><p>Here is the outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a main menu: part 1 – adding text</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a main menu: part 2 – adding buttons</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a main menu: part 3 – button functionality</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Replacing the default UFPS HUD</p></li></ul></div></div>
