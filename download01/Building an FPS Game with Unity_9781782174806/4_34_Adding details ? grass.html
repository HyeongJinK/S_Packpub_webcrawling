<span class="strong"><strong>Paint Details</strong></span> tool to add more details to our maps.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The mode to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Plant Trees</strong></span> mode is the <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Details</strong></span> mode. Click on it, then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Details…</strong></span> button, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Grass Texture</strong></span>. Select<a id="id223" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Grass</strong></span> texture inside of the <code class="literal">TerrainAssets\Grass</code> folder for <span class="strong"><strong>Detail Texture</strong></span>. After this, set <span class="strong"><strong>Healthy Color</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Dry Color</strong></span> by using the eyedropper and choosing a color similar to our textures. Once you're done modifying the settings, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_21.jpg" /></div><p>The eyedropper can actually pick up colors from anywhere, including the textures on the Terrain, making it very easy for us to pick out similar colors.</p></li><li><p>Once<a id="id224" class="indexterm"></a> created, start dragging around to paint the grass in the world in the same way we <a id="id225" class="indexterm"></a>did the textures. If you can't see it being placed, zoom in as you need to be close to see it. You can adjust <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Target Strength</strong></span> to a lower value to make the grass more dispersed and not so close to each other.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_22.jpg" /></div><p>Depending<a id="id226" class="indexterm"></a> on the power of your computer, you may want to have less grass and/or details. You can see the grass further away by increasing the <span class="strong"><strong>Detail Distance</strong></span> property if you have a powerful computer.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, our current island is very flat and while that's okay for cities, nature is random. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab with the Terrain object selected, go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Height Raise/Lower</strong></span> mode in the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> component and gently raise and lower the levels of some areas to give the illusion of depth. Do note that your trees and grass will rise and fall with the changes you make.</p></li><li><p>Once you're finished, save your level and play the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_23.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"></a>Note</h3><p>This aspect of level creation isn't very difficult, it is just time-consuming. However, it's the time taken to put in these details that really sets a game apart from other titles. Generally, you'll want to playtest and make sure that your level is fun before you perform these actions. But I feel, it's important for you to have an idea of how it is done for your future projects.</p></div></div>
