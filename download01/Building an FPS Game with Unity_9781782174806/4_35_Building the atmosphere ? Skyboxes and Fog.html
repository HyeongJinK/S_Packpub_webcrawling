Let's add some effects to make the game more visually appealing.</p><p>The first <a id="id228" class="indexterm"></a>part of creating the atmosphere is to add something to the sky. Now, in Unity 5, we are given a Skybox by default, but we will be using one of our own that's provided by UFPS. <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox</strong></span><a id="id229" class="indexterm"></a> is a method of creating backgrounds<a id="id230" class="indexterm"></a> to make the area seem bigger than it really is by putting an image in the areas that are currently being filled with the light blue color, staying still while we move just like the sky doesn't move when we go around because it's so far away.</p><p>The reason we say Skybox is because we save six textures (one for each side of a cube). Game engines<a id="id231" class="indexterm"></a> such as unreal have <span class="strong"><strong>skydomes</strong></span><a id="id232" class="indexterm"></a> that do the same thing just with a hemisphere instead of a cube:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To <a id="id233" class="indexterm"></a>modify the skybox, we can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span>. Once in there, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> button to look at the lighting properties of the current scene.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, click on the search bar in the top-right corner and type in <code class="literal">Skybox</code>. You'll see that there are a couple of Skyboxes that we've already imported that are a part of UFPS. Drag and drop the <code class="literal">Sunny2 Skybox</code> object into the <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox </strong></span>property from the <span class="strong"><strong>Environment Lighting</strong></span> tab.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_24.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Save your scene and play the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_25.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information<a id="id234" class="indexterm"></a> on building you own Skybox, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UseSkybox.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UseSkybox.html</a>.</p></div><p>This <a id="id235" class="indexterm"></a>already <a id="id236" class="indexterm"></a>makes our level look a lot nicer and full of life, but there are also some other things we can do to make it look even better.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fog</strong></span><a id="id237" class="indexterm"></a> is <a id="id238" class="indexterm"></a>another way to create the atmosphere of a level. Fog obscures far away objects, which both, adds to the atmosphere and saves rendering power. The denser the fog, the more the game will feel like a horror game. The first game of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Silent Hill</em></span> franchise used fog to make the game run at an acceptable frame-rate as it had a large 3D environment on the early PlayStation hardware. Because of how well it spooked players, they continued using it in the later games even though they could render larger areas with the current technology.</p><p>This being said, if you think fog is only used in this way, you'd be mistaken. If you've ever been to a mountain range or seen something further away at a distance, you may notice that things get more tinted in a blue color with an aerial perspective.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note46"></a>Note</h3><p>You can find <a id="id239" class="indexterm"></a>more information on aerial perspective at <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_perspective" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_perspective</a>.</p></div><p>To create the<a id="id240" class="indexterm"></a> atmosphere using <span class="strong"><strong>Fog</strong></span> perform<a id="id241" class="indexterm"></a> the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Scroll down the <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span> tab till you see the <span class="strong"><strong>Fog </strong></span>section and check it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_26.jpg" /></div><p>If you were to play the game right now, it would look like the previous image. Right now, it looks a bit too grey because of the <span class="strong"><strong>Fog Color</strong></span> property that is set. Change it instead to the same color as the sky.</p></li><li><p>Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Fog Color</strong></span> and change the color to be the same as they sky using the eyedropper tool and then run the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_04_27.jpg" /></div><p>Fog is <a id="id242" class="indexterm"></a>also really great in <a id="id243" class="indexterm"></a>terms of not letting our players know what's too far ahead of them to create suspense. The scene is already looking better.</p><p>Lastly, our current form of lighting is very bland and one-dimensional. Due to the way the lighting is done, if your lighting is done at an angle, all of the areas affected by shadows will have little to no light, making it very hard to see things.</p><p>To add to this, we can create another directional light in the opposite direction with less intensity (also known as a <span class="strong"><strong>fill light</strong></span>) to ensure that the areas are lit better and we can see as much details as possible.</p></li><li><p>Select our <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> object and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> to duplicate it.</p></li><li><p>Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Snap Settings</strong></span> and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> snap to <code class="literal">180</code>. This will ensure that, when we rotate, it will be exactly the opposite (to rotate all the way around an object is 360 degrees. 360/2 is 180).</p></li><li><p>Select<a id="id244" class="indexterm"></a> the newly created <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> and then rotate it till it snaps (a <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> of <code class="literal">310</code>, <code class="literal">150</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>).</p></li><li><p>Next, change<a id="id245" class="indexterm"></a> the color to blue and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">.5</code>. The reason we are using blue is that it is a complimentary color to yellow, which means that they look good together in general.</p></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on <a id="id246" class="indexterm"></a>complimentary colors, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors</a>.</p><p>To find complimentary colors, you can use a tool such as ColorHexa.
