But, of course, we will actually need to have materials to do that, so let's get started with that!</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To start off, we will need to open up a level to work with. Either open up your own level created previously or open <code class="literal">Chapter8_SampleMap</code> provided in the <code class="literal">Example Code</code> project.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_10.jpg" /></div><p>This <a id="id465" class="indexterm"></a>level uses the concepts that we learned <a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a>about in the previous chapters, building a level in Prototype on top of the terrain that we created previously. Notice that, even though the objects are a tad more complicated than what we created before, I simply looked at real-life buildings for inspiration and fleshed them out with more details.</p><p>Now that we have a level here for us to work with, we will also need to have something to actually put on the walls. In Unity, we can control the visual appearance of game objects making use of materials. Materials control the visual aspect of an object. This will include the shader used on the object as well as its color, shinyness, and how bumpy it is in addition to many other properties. To create Materials, we usually apply textures, or image files, into various properties to adjust the settings. Let's see how that works.</p></li><li><p>In the <code class="literal">Example Code</code> folder for this chapter, you'll see a folder called <code class="literal">GameTextures</code>. Drag-and-drop this folder into your project and wait for it to import.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note72"></a>Note</h3><p>These textures were provided by the great folks at <span class="emphasis"><em>GameTextures.com</em></span>, which has a huge array of ready-to-use materials for use in games with little to no effort. It's been a huge time-saver for someone like myself who doesn't have the time to build materials from scratch and is used by thousands of other indie titles as well as several huge-name AAA studios. You can find them at: <a class="ulink" href="http://gametextures.com/" target="_blank">http://gametextures.com/</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Each of <a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a>these folders will contain the files that we will need <a id="id468" class="indexterm"></a>in order to create a material. To get started, let's open up the <code class="literal">BrownBrick</code> folder from the<span class="strong"><strong> Project</strong></span> tab and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Material</strong></span>. Once it's created give it the name <code class="literal">BrownBrick</code>.</p></li><li><p>Select the object and you should see a large number of properties in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. Drag-and-drop the <code class="literal">brownBrick_unity_albedo</code> file onto the box to the left of the <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo</strong></span> property, the <code class="literal">brownBrick_unity_height</code> file onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Height Map</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Occlusion</strong></span> properties, and the <code class="literal">brownBrick_unity_normal</code> file onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Normal Map</strong></span> property. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> property, set <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code> from the slider and <span class="strong"><strong>Smoothness</strong></span> to <code class="literal">.1</code>. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Height Map</strong></span>, change the slider to <code class="literal">.08</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once you do <a id="id469" class="indexterm"></a>that you'll see text appear below the <span class="strong"><strong>Normal Map</strong></span> saying that the texture isn't <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>marked as a normal map. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Fix Now</strong></span> button and you should notice the material has become much nicer to look at.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_07_12.jpg" /></div><p>Newly introduced in Unity 5, the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Shader</strong></span> <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>is now the default way to create all materials for non-mobile platforms. It's a powerful tool, but may be a bit complex for newcomers. Here is a quick description of each of the properties we used.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo</strong></span> property stands for the base color to be used on the surface of the object to be placed.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Normal Map</strong></span> property is what's referred to as a bump map, which is a special kind of texture that will add bumps and other aspects to the material to artificially add depth to the object, as you can see in the changes done to the material.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Height Map</strong></span> property is another kind of bump map but, instead of showing the difference in direction the surface appears to face, it <a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a>shows how high the surface should appear to be raised (black not at all, white all the way). The <span class="strong"><strong>Height Map</strong></span> property has a slider that will allow you to scale how high or low the bricks appear in your image.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally, the <span class="strong"><strong>Occlusion</strong></span> map<a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a> provides information on what parts of the material should receive indirect lighting from <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> and the like.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> parameter sets the reflectivity and light response of the object. It contains two sliders, <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Smoothness</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> sets how "metal-like" the surface is. <code class="literal">1.0</code> is pure metal, <code class="literal">0</code> is not metal at all. Smoothness is how smooth the surface appears to be. For instance, if <span class="strong"><strong>Smoothness</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> are both at <code class="literal">1</code> you'll get a mirror.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note73"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span> parameters of <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> check out: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameters.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameters.html</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Go through the other materials and do the same thing, making sure to use the sliders to get what looks right for you specifically while learning how each property modifies the material. While doing so you may want to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Ghetto Window</strong></span> on the bottom so that instead of showing a sphere you show a box instead.
