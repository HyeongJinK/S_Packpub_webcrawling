Follow these steps to create a new project in Unity:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With Unity started, go to <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span>. Enter a <span class="strong"><strong>Project Name</strong></span> value such as <code class="literal">FPS Game - Chapter 1</code> as that's what we are making and the chapter we're making it for, or whatever you want to call your project. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span> of your choice somewhere on your hard drive and ensure that you have your game set to <code class="literal">3D</code>. Once completed, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create project</strong></span>. At this point, we do not need to<a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a> import any packages as we'll be doing it manually.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_04.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Here on, if you see the <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome to Unity</strong></span> pop up, feel free to close it as we won't be using it. At this point, you will be brought to the general Unity layout, which should look as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_05.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>I'm assuming you have some familiarity with Unity before you read this book.
