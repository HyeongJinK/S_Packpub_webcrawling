You have to type in the values for each piece that you want to add or you have to create everything inside a modeling program and import it, which will require you to have 3D modeling skills.</p><p>Other game engines have tools like <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Binary Space Partitioning</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BSP</strong></span>) or <span class="strong"><strong>Constructive Solid Geometry</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSG</strong></span>), which <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>allow you to build geometry from scratch and apply materials to it to create areas for play. Filling in the gap that Unity has, ProCore3D has created a toolkit that allows for in-editor construction.</p><p>We will later on use ProBuilder to polish up our final product; but, in the meantime, we will use Prototype, their free version to build the basic structure and flow of our levels without wasting time, thus making things visually appealing until we polish it. Perform the following steps to install <span class="strong"><strong>Prototype</strong></span>:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> once again by going to the toolbar, searching for <code class="literal">Prototype</code>, and looking for the following icon:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_15.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on <a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a>the first option in the top-left corner and you should be brought to a page like the following one:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_11.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>After the writing of this book, Prototype will in the near future be replaced by ProBuilder Basic which is still 100% free but has additional features. I've talked with the creators about this, and they've confirmed with me after reading the book that everything discussed here should still work with the new version. For more information on this, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Click on <a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button and wait for it to finish. Then, import the entire package by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We will now test it out to see whether everything is imported correctly. Create a new scene inside Unity by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Scene</strong></span>. Once there, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span> to create a new cube using Prototype.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781782174806/graphics/B04317_01_12.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>With this, we know that it was installed correctly! It may look pretty simple now, but we will be diving even more into using these tools later on.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information <a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a>on Prototype, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/prototype/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/prototype/</a>.</p></div></div>
