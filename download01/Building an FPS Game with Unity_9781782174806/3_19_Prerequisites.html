While you may think a level designer will just jump into the editor and start playing, the truth is you normally need to do tons of planning ahead of time before you even open your tool.</p><p>Generally, a level begins with an idea. This can come from anything; maybe you saw a really cool building or a photo on the Internet gave you a certain feeling; maybe you want to teach the player a new mechanic. Turning this idea into a level is what a level designer does. Taking all of these ideas, the level designer will create a level design document that will outline exactly what you're trying to achieve with the entire level from start to end.</p><p>A level design document will describe everything inside the level, listing all of the possible encounters, puzzles, so on and so forth that the player will need to complete as well as any side quests that the player will be able to achieve. To prepare for this, you should include as many references as you can with maps, images, and movies similar to what you're trying to achieve. If you're working with a team, making this document available on a website or Wiki will be a great asset so that you know exactly what is being done in the level, what the team can use in their levels, and how difficult their encounters can be. Generally, you'll also want a top-down layout of your level done either on a computer or graph paper with a line showing the player's general route through the level with the encounters and missions planned out.</p><p>Of course, you don't want to be too tied down to your design document. It will change as you playtest and work on the level, but the documentation process will help solidify your ideas and give you a firm basis to work on.</p><p>For those of you <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>interested in seeing some level design documents, feel free to check out Adam Reynolds (<span class="emphasis"><em>Level Designer on Homefront</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Call of Duty: World at War</em></span>) at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Level_Design:_Level_Design_Document_Example" target="_blank">http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Level_Design:_Level_Design_Document_Example</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to learn more about level designing, check out <span class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Game Level Design</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Marc Scattergood</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>John Feil </em></span>(previously my teacher), Cengage Learning PTR.

But it is something that you have to do on your own.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec10"></a>Creating the architectural overview</h3></div></div></div><p>As a level designer, one of <a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a>the most time-consuming tasks of your job will be to create environments. There are many different ways out there to create levels. By default, Unity gives us some default meshes <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>such as a Box, Sphere, and Cylinder. While it's technically possible to build a level in this manner, it could get tedious very quickly. Next, I'm going to go through the most popular options to build levels for the games made in Unity before we jump into building a level of our own.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec01"></a>3D modeling software</h4></div></div></div><p>Opening <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>up a 3D modeling software package and building architectures this way is what professional game studios often do. This gives you maximum freedom to create your environment and allows you to do exactly what you'd like to do; but this requires you to be proficient in that tool, be it Maya, 3ds Max, Blender (that can be downloaded for free at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org/</a>), or some other tool. Then, you just need to export your models and import them in Unity.</p><p>Unity <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>supports a lot of different formats for 3D models (the most commonly used are <code class="literal">.obj</code> and <code class="literal">.fbx</code>), but there are a lot of issues to consider. For some best practices when it comes to creating art assets, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/" target="_blank">http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec02"></a>Constructing geometry with brushes</h4></div></div></div><p>Using <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Constructive Solid Geometry</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSG</strong></span>), commonly <a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a>referred to as brushes, is a tool artists/designers use to quickly block out pieces of a level from scratch. Using brushes inside the in-game level editor has been a common approach for artists/designers to create levels. Unreal Engine 4, Hammer, Radiant, and other professional game engines make use of this building structure, making it quite easy for people to create and iterate through levels quickly through a process called whiteboxing as it's very easy to make changes to simple shapes. However, just like learning a modeling software tool, there can be higher barriers in creating complex geometry using a 3D application, but using CSG brushes will provide a quick solution to create shapes with ease.</p><p>Unity does not support building things like using brushes (CSG) by default, but there are several tools in the Unity Asset Store that allow you to do so. For example, sixbyseven studio has an extension called<a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>ProBuilder</strong></span> that can add this functionality to Unity, making it very easy to build our levels. The only possible downside is the fact that it costs money, though it is worth every penny. However, sixbyseven has kindly released a free version of their tools called <span class="strong"><strong>Prototype</strong></span><a id="id79" class="indexterm"></a> that we installed earlier, which contains everything we would need for this chapter. But it does not allow us to add custom textures and some of the more advanced tools. We will be using ProBuilder later on in the book to polish the entire<a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a> product. You can find more information on ProBuilder at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec03"></a>Modular tilesets</h4></div></div></div><p>Another way<a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a> to generate <a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a>architecture is through the use of <span class="strong"><strong>tiles</strong></span> that are created by artists to build levels. Similar to using Lego pieces, we can use these tiles to snap together walls and other objects to create a building. With the creative use of tiles, you can create a lot of content with minimal assets. This is probably the easiest way to create a level at the expense of not being able to create unique-looking buildings, since you only have a few pieces to work with. Titles such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Skyrim</em></span> use this to great extents to create their large world environments.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec01"></a>Mix and match</h5></div></div></div><p>Of <a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a>course, it's also possible to use a mixture of the previously mentioned tools to use the advantages of doing things in certain ways. For example, you could use brushes to block out an area and then use a group of tiles called a <span class="strong"><strong>tileset</strong></span><a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a> to replace the boxes with highly detailed models, which is what a lot of AAA studios do. In addition, we could also place brushes initially to test our gameplay and then add in props to break up the repetitiveness of the levels.</p></div></div></div></div>
