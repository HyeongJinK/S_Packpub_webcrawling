You've now created the first level of Dead Keys. Of course, more will be added, but let's first focus on creating one functional level, whose behaviors may be easily recycled to produce more levels, as needed. This chapter focused on many level design issues, both practical and theoretical. Specifically, we explored level design tips and tricks-methods for producing levels more simply and conveniently. In addition, we examined the modular building technique, alongside more advanced tools, such as lightmapping, navigation meshes, and Occlusion Culling. In the next chapter, we'll examine how to take the first person camera and build player functionality, using animation and scripting.</p></div>
