Combat in <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> is ultimately an exercise in speed typing. A complete word or phrase in English is randomly selected from a large dictionary, then presented in UI form above the head of an attacking zombie. One or more zombies may attack the player at any one time, each associated with a unique word or phrase. The player must use the keyboard to type the matching phrase as quickly as possible, mitigating the attack and destroying the zombie. Hence, they must type under time pressure. When a word or phrase is entered in full correctly, letter for letter, the zombie is destroyed. Mistakes in typing reset progress, forcing the player to retype the phrase from the first letter.</p><p>
