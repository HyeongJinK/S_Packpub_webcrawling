<span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> is played inthe  first-person perspective, meaning that the camera is positioned at the eye point of the player character. However, the player doesn't get free-roaming control as with many first-person games using the <span class="emphasis"><em>WASD</em></span> keys. Here, camera movement through the level is pre-scripted. Specifically, the camera moves from point to point along a carefully defined path when the player progresses by killing zombies. Nevertheless, the player still has some control over character movement, albeit minor. After defeating a wave of zombies by typing words, the game essentially pauses until the player confirms they're ready to move forward by clicking/tapping a forwards icon. This gives the player opportunity to prepare and creates dramatic tension about the possible dangers lurking ahead.</p><p>
