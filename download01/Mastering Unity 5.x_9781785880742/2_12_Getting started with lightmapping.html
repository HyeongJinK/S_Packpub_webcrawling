To activate Lightmap UVs, select all environment meshes in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and enable <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Lightmap UV</strong></span> from the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>. This method is useful for generating a second UV channel when one doesn't already exist. This defines how lighting is baked to the lightmap texture. Unity applies an auto-unwrap projection using settings from the <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced</strong></span> roll out. If, by contrast, your own meshes already have a custom, second channel, then you can use this channel instead for Lightmap UVs simply by disabling <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Lightmap UVs</strong></span>.</p><p>

</p><p>Configuring Lightmap UVs</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>For meshes with two UV channels, you can enable <span class="strong"><strong>Swap UVs</strong></span> from the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> to switch channel order, if needed. This makes the second channel the primary, and the first channel the secondary. The primary channel is used for regular texture mapping and the secondary for Lightmap UVs.</p></div><p>Next, strategically position all lights in the scene, taking care to add as few as possible while maintaining your central artistic vision.</p><p>

</p><p>Adding lights</p><p>Here, I've used point lights. These are especially useful for simulating interior, artificial lights (ceiling or wall). For each light, I specified a color tint (red, green, or blue) and an intensity to enhance atmosphere and interest. For the <span class="strong"><strong>Baking</strong></span> field, a value of <span class="strong"><strong>Baked</strong></span> is specified, meaning every light applies only to Baked lighting (lightmapping) and not precomputed GI. In addition, <span class="strong"><strong>Soft Shadows</strong></span> are specified for the <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Type</strong></span>, allowing soft, realistic shadow casting for the environment in the baking process. Remember, being Baked lights, they will not factor in any real-time lighting calculations, except through Light Probes, as we'll see soon.</p><p>

</p><p>Configuring Baked lights</p><p>Finally, enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span> checkbox in the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> for all non-moving environment objects. The best approach here is to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel to append all environment objects as children of a common root node. And then to mark the root node as static. By doing this, the operation cascades downwards automatically to all children. This saves you lots of time from enabling static for each object separately.</p><p>

Saving is needed as the scene file encodes some important lightmapping data and connections.</p></div></div>
