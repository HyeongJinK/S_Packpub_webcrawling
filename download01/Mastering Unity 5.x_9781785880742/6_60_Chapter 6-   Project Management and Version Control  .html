These are critically important for organizing your work, ensuring development is focused and completed as per the schedule and with the intended quality. You might think these practices are unnecessary for people working alone or in very small teams, but this is not true. Teams of all sizes, from one person to hundreds, need some degree of Project Management skill, and version control is a technology (alongside others) that can really help. Speaking generally, Project Management is about understanding the project design, aspirations and required workload, and then creating a schedule to support that workload, distributing tasks to qualified people, at the right times, for completion by an appropriate deadline. Version Control, as we'll see, is a technology we can use to save ourselves time. It effectively lets us take periodic snapshots of our work throughout development, whether in Unity or other software, allowing us to revert the status of our work back to an earlier stage, if needed. This is useful for undoing wrong-turns and mistakes in development. So let's get started.</p></div>
