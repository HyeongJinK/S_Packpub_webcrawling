However, for programmers and developers, the situation is different. Programmers work collaboratively with code and script files, and this creates some important needs that are substantially different or acute:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>First, coders frequently work together on the same source code. This may involve collaborating on different functions or areas of the same project, but also collaborating on the code in the same file. Consequently, they need an easy way to identify lines that have changed between edits, who made the changes and when and why.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Second, coding often requires developers to explore and experiment with different solutions and techniques. The aim is to reach decisions about which solution is best. This means coders need an easy way to reverse small or large scale changes, restoring a project back to an earlier state before the changes were made.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Third, coders normally like to reuse code from other sources, like libraries and source files, where it's relevant and saves us work. The basic idea is that code created for earlier projects may be relevant to the latest ones too, so why not merge that code into the existing project, instead of reinventing the wheel. Thus, the ability to merge code between projects is really useful!</p></li></ul></div><p>To conclude, then, coders benefit from a file-system that identifies and tracks file changes, allows those changes to be reversed, and supports merging behaviors that allow us to reuse and integrate code from external sources. These features and more are supported by <span class="emphasis"><em>version control</em></span> with <span class="emphasis"><em>Git</em></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>Version control </strong></span>as a concept lets us track, reverse and merge changes, and <span class="strong"><strong>Git</strong></span> is simply one program that supports version control features.</p><p>Git is a free of cost, open source program that can be downloaded, installed, and then used to apply version control to your files. When used and configured appropriately, it can be an incredible asset to your workflow. One way to obtain Git is by visiting the Git homepage at <a class="ulink" href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>The Git homepage</p><p>The Git homepage provides you access to the standard, command-line Git tool. However, by default, this tool has no GUI interface. You use it by typing commands and instructions into a console which is syntax sensitive. That means spelling, grammatical and structural errors will not execute at all, or at least not as intended. This can be awkward for newcomers, who must learn a new syntax, and unintuitive for experienced users, who may be seeking a graphical, point-and-click simplicity. For this reason, we'll consider a specific <span class="strong"><strong>Git client</strong></span> (a program that builds on the fundamental Git framework to extend its features and make it easier to use). Specifically, we'll use <span class="strong"><strong>GitKraken</strong></span>, which is a graphical, free and cross-platform Git client. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. This program is a completely stand-alone download and installation, so you don't need to download or install any pre-requisite files and packages. To access GitKraken, visit the homepage <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gitkraken.com" target="_blank">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>, and click the<span class="strong"><strong> Download </strong></span>GitKraken button.</p><p>

</p><p>Downloading GitKraken</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"></a>Note</h3><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GitKraken </strong></span>homepage should auto-detect your operating system, allowing you to download the best version for you when selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button. However, if the wrong version is selected, you can manually choose a download by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>See All Platforms </strong></span>option below the download button.</p></div><p>After downloading the GitKraken package, run the installer program to the install the software to your computer. Great work!</p></div>
