<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec88"></a>Building for VR (Virtual Reality)</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Right now, there's intense interest in <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VR</strong></span>) in gaming. This is an umbrella term referring to a range of different wearable headsets that surround the eyes and immerse the player in a 3D virtual world. Head movement is tracked (that is, its rotation is monitored) and used to control what is seen through the headset. Typically, head motion controls a first-person camera in a 3D environment. Unity ships with support for selected VR platforms, including Oculus and Samsung Gear. Developing for VR in Unity is made simple in that most 3D concepts apply to VR. There are a range of interesting design considerations that apply to VR, such as interface design, player height variance, object interactivity, and 2D design.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys </em></span>project is not primarily designed for VR, but this section explores a few steps that could be taken towards integrating VR support in principle. To get started with VR development in Unity, you should download the Oculus Development Kit, from here: <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apkinstaller.ApkInstaller&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note65"></a>Note</h3><p>Currently, VR development with Oculus is supported only on Windows.</p></div><p>

</p><p>Installing the VR SDK</p><p>Next, open the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> from the application menu, and from the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality Supported</strong></span> option.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_052.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Enabling Virtual Reality Support</p><p>On enabling the <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality Supported</strong></span> option, you can select the supported SDK. By default, the only option is <span class="strong"><strong>Oculus</strong></span>. Leave this option selected.</p><p>

</p><p>Selecting a VR SDK</p><p>Next, download the Oculus Sample Framework for Unity 5, to see a selection of projects and additional classes and libraries for use, here: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/" target="_blank">https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/game-engines/1.5.1/Oculus_Sample_Framework_for_Unity_5_Project/</a>.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_054.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Downloading Oculus Sample Packages</p><p>In addition to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Oculus Sample Packages</em></span>, Unity also have a VR Package that features useful scripts and classes that can be used quickly and effectively in VR. This is available for free from the Unity Asset Store here: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/game-engines/1.5.1/Oculus_Sample_Framework_for_Unity_5_Project/" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51519</a>.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_055.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Downloading a VR Unity package</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity VR</em></span> package creates two main folders, <code class="literal">VRStandardAssets</code> and <code class="literal">VRSampleScenes</code>. The <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> folder features reusable scripts and classes for many VR projects, and the <code class="literal">Sample Scenes</code> folder contains example scenes demonstrating the use of these assets.</p><p>

<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> see the online Unity documentation here: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51519" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development?playlist=22946</a>.</p><p>Great work! You're now ready to start working in VR. Thankfully, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> is a first-person project, making it easy to transition to VR. The biggest challenge is in implementing effective keyboard controls when the player cannot see the keyboard, due to wearing a VR headset. To solve this issue, you could create a world space UI for keyboard support, that is, a GUI representation of the keyboard in the world. More information on World Space User Interfaces can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development?playlist=22946" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UIWorldSpace.html</a>.</p></div>
