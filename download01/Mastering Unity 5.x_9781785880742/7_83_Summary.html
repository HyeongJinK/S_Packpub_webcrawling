By reaching this point we have come a long way. We've developed Dead Keys from the ground upwards, and now the game can track user progress, from level to level. This is great, and in doing this we've seen various methods for saving persistent data. Next up, we'll complete the Dead Keys project and see a wide range of subjects along the way!</p></div>
