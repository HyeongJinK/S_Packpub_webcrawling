Working at a high organizational level, Trello helps us break down tasks, costs and time. But, for developers going about their work every day, more is needed. Artists, animators and other creatives frequently need to share files with each other, like textures, meshes, movies, animations, and more. To do this, you can use e-mail attachments and memory sticks, but this soon grows tedious: e-mail attachments are very limited in size, and memory sticks require people to be located close to each other if they're to be effective. Ideally, artists need a central, internet-accessible storage space for their files, which can be accessed by all team members. This is where cloud storage and synchronization clients can be very useful. Cloud storage refers to a <span class="emphasis"><em>remote server </em></span>where users can upload and download their files. It's simply a storage place somewhere on the net. All users can access it, provided they have the appropriate login credentials. There are many cloud storage options available, some free and some commercial. The free options normally have important limitations: such as limited space (<span class="emphasis"><em>like 10 GB of total storage</em></span>), or limited bandwidth (<span class="emphasis"><em>like a 10 GB transfer limit per month</em></span>), and sometimes limited file types (<span class="emphasis"><em>like PNGs, or ZIPs</em></span>), or file sizes (<span class="emphasis"><em>like 4 GB for a single file</em></span>). Some common cloud storage solutions include (in no special order):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Google Drive (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/drive/</a>)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>OneDrive (<a class="ulink" href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank">https://onedrive.live.com</a>)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>DropBox (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com</a>)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Amazon Cloud Drive (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/clouddrive/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.co.uk/clouddrive/</a>)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>BackBlaze (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.backblaze.com" target="_blank">https://www.backblaze.com</a>)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>HiDrive (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.free-hidrive.com" target="_blank">https://www.free-hidrive.com</a>)
</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember to check out the terms and conditions of any cloud storage provider before signing up for an account. Each provider has different policies on acceptable file sizes, usage, and content.</p></div><p>Signing up to one or more of these providers gives you access to storage space for sharing your files between team members. One problem that arises for most solutions is easy file synchronization between systems and users. Specifically, how can saving your files on one computer automatically update other computers, keeping all machines updated with the latest changes for everybody? Some storage solutions (like Google Drive, DropBox, and OneDrive) offer desktop client applications that can auto-sync files. However, these are usually solution specific - for example, the <span class="emphasis"><em>OneDrive</em></span> client synchronizes files across all OneDrive linked computers only. This solution is workable and easy if you're using only one storage solution. But if you decide to use multiple, you'll probably want a solution that synchronizes files automatically across all the storage systems, treating them as a single consolidated cloud drive. You can achieve this using the freely available <span class="strong"><strong>ODrive</strong></span> system.
