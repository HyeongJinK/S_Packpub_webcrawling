Dead Keys will eventually feature multiple cameras, each with a dedicated purpose. But now, let's focus on the main camera; that is, the player perspective in the scene. For first person games, you could create a camera easily by dragging and dropping a <span class="strong"><strong>First Person Controller</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel into the scene, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span> asset package. However, for Dead Keys, we don't need that; our camera path is fixed as it moves through the level and the user doesn't need free-look controls with the mouse or <span class="emphasis"><em>WASD</em></span> keys. Consequently, we'll create a custom camera from the ground upwards. </p><p>Let's start by creating a camera object, by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> from the application menu. This adds a fresh, new camera to the scene.</p><p>

</p><p>Previewing Occlusion Data</p><p>Each object in the scene may be tagged, using either a predefined tag or a custom tag. The purpose of a tag is to help Unity quickly and easily identify specific objects or types of objects quickly, especially in code. Each scene should have one and only one <span class="strong"><strong>MainCamera</strong></span>. That is, one camera object tagged as <span class="strong"><strong>MainCamera</strong></span>. For Dead Keys, and for most games, this should be the main player camera. This will be highly important for our code, as it relies on the <span class="strong"><strong>MainCamera</strong></span> tag to find the one and only player camera. Thus, tag the player camera as <span class="strong"><strong>MainCamera</strong></span>, using the object tag dropdown, from the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_02_074.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Tagging cameras as the MainCamera</p><p>Set the camera <span class="strong"><strong>Projection</strong></span> method to <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span>, which renders the scene in <span class="emphasis"><em>true 3D</em></span>, applying foreshortening effects to objects, making them smaller in the distance. In addition, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Field of View</strong></span> to <code class="literal">60</code>, to more closely imitate the human field of vision, and adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Clipping Planes</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.3</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>Near</strong></span>, and <code class="literal">32.2</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>Far</strong></span>. You may need to use trial and error for adjusting the latter settings. The ideal value for <span class="strong"><strong>Near</strong></span> is the highest value that allows the camera to move closest to a mesh without clipping, and the ideal for <span class="strong"><strong>Far </strong></span>is the lowest value that allows the furthest object to be seen.</p><p>

</p><p>Configuring projection, Field of View and Clipping Planes</p><p>Now, ensure <span class="strong"><strong>Occlusion Culling</strong></span> is enabled for the player camera from the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> component. Furthermore, any and all cameras that can display scene meshes should have <span class="strong"><strong>Occlusion Culling</strong></span> enabled.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_02_076.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Enabling Occlusion Culling</p><p>Finally, let's apply a <span class="strong"><strong>Culling Mask</strong></span> to the camera. This specifies which scene layers (and their associated game objects) should be included or excluded from the camera. For the player camera, exclude the UI layer, to prevent double rendering of the UI. A separate camera will be dedicated to UI rendering, as we'll see later. To exclude the UI from renders, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Culling Mask</strong></span> dropdown and disable the <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> layer.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_02_077.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Specifying a camera culling mask</p><p>Good work! You've now configured a camera, at least initially, for Dead Keys; a prescripted first-person game. We'll have reason later to tweak some camera settings, but for now, these will work fine.</p></div>
