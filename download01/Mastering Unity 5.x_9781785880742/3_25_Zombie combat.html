This is the central mechanic and main challenge. Each zombie is associated with a word or short phrase chosen randomly from a dictionary for each zombie at level start-up. The player must speed-type letters on the keyboard during combat to match the word or phrase for the nearest attacking zombie. If the player makes a mistake by entering the wrong letter, then the current word match is reset; that is, the player must retype the complete word or phrase from the beginning. Only a completely correct entry, letter for letter, qualifies as a match, after which the associated zombie is destroyed. This mechanic means we must accept keyboard input from the player, such as a standard keyboard for PC and Mac, and on-screen keyboard input from mobile devices, like iPhones. Traditional keyboard input for typing, however, is only meaningful during combat sections.</p><p>
