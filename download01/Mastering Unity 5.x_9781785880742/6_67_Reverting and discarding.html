But revert isn't limited to just that. Revert can restore a Branch back to even earlier Commits going back to the very first Commit if needed. To do this, we simply need to find the Commit we want to restore in the branch, and then revert the Commit above that. This makes sense because we're effectively reverting all commits subsequent to the chosen one. Simply right-click on the Commit above, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span>. For this example, I am reverting to the first commit.</p><p>

</p><p>Reverting to an Earlier Commit</p><p>If you now open a Windows Explorer or Mac Finder window to your Git managed folder, you'll see the file contents updated to reflect the selected Commit on the Active Branch. In Git terminology, we are always viewing the <span class="strong"><strong>Head</strong></span> (topmost Commit) of the <span class="strong"><strong>Current Branch </strong></span>(Selected Branch in the Repo). The folder will not include any Unity Projects, because all commits subsequent to the first have now been undone. Note: the folder may contain some additional files. These are files <span class="emphasis"><em>ignored</em></span> by Git, because they satisfy the GitIgnore file. Therefore, Git neither adds ignored files to Commits nor removes them from reverted Commits.</p><p>

</p><p>Git controls the file contents of all managed folders</p><p>We can always get back our work from any Commit, simply by using Revert again. This returns our Unity project back to the Repo folder, and this is reflected in either Windows Explorer or Mac Finder.</p><p>

</p><p>Changing the Repo folder contents by using revert</p><p>Of course, sometimes the contents of your repo folder can change unintentionally or automatically, such as when a program generates a temp file, or when Windows or Mac updates metadata for thumbnail images. Frequently, you don't need these changes. And yet, Git will still recognize them and create a new entry in the Branch History, creating Unstaged Changes ready for you to Commit.</p><p>

</p><p>Git often detects unneeded changes</p><p>When unnecessary or superfluous changes are detected that you don't want to keep as a Commit, you can easily discard them;Â Tell Git to remove them and restore the folder, and all its files, back to the latest commit. To do this, click the<span class="strong"><strong> Discard all Changes</strong></span> button from the Properties Panel. You will be asked to confirm your decision by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Reset All</strong></span>.</p><p>

</p><p>Discarding changes with Git</p><p>Great! By using a combination of Revert and Discard, you can now easily choose what should be committed, and you can undo the history back to any earlier Commit.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on Revert changes, check out the Atlassian Help documentation on using Git: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting</a>
