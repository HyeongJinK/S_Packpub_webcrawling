After making Commits on the local Repo, the changes are not automatically synchronized to the Remote. This is because changes could be undone, or because the developer doesn't have Internet access. For this reason, new Commits and Branches remain, by default, on the Local Repo only, until you explicitly <span class="strong"><strong>Upload</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>Push</strong></span>). To <span class="strong"><strong>Push</strong></span> changes, you click the <span class="strong"><strong>Push </strong></span>button.</p><p>

</p><p>Pushing local changes to a Remote Repo</p><p>To download the latest changes from an existing Repo and merge them into the LocalÂ Repo, you click the <span class="strong"><strong>Pull </strong></span>button. This updates the Local Repo with changes on the server. In many cases, this is the equivalent of updating the local Repo to match the Remote. But it's possible to Pull down changes into a different local Repo, merging and integrating the changes to make a completely different Repo.</p><p>
