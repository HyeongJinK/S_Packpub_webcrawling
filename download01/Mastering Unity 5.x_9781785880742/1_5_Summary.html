On reaching this point, you now have a Unity project with most assets imported, ready to begin your development work. This will happen in the next chapter. The foundation so far includes imported environment modules, zombie meshes, textures, audio files, and more. In importing these assets, we considered many issues, such as optimal asset construction, import guidelines, and how to solve both common and less obvious problems that sometimes occur along the way. The fully prepared and configured project, ready to begin, can be found in this book's companion files, in the <code class="literal">Chapter02/Start</code> folder. This saves you from having to import all assets manually. In the next chapter, we'll focus in depth on level design and construction techniques, from skyboxes and lighting to emotion, mood, and atmosphere.</p></div>
