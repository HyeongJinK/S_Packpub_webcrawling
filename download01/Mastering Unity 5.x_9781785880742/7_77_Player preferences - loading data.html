<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec75"></a>Player preferences - loading data</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Having previously saved data with <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> through Set functions, you can easily load that data back through accompanying Get functions (<code class="literal">GetInt</code>, <code class="literal">GetFloat</code>, and <code class="literal">GetString</code>). With these, you simply specify a unique key name, and Unity returns the respective value. Consider the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">int HighScore = PlayerPrefs.GetInt ("HighScore", 0); 
float RemainingTime = PlayerPrefs.GetFloat ("RemainingTime", 0f); 
string Name = PlayerPrefs.GetString ("PlayerName", "Jon Doe"); 
</pre><p>Each Get function requires only one essential parameter; namely, the key to retrieve. This is the first parameter. But what happens if you specify a key that doesn't exist? Which value should be returned by default in that case? To handle this, each Get function supports a second, optional parameter, which is always returned if the specified key doesn't exist.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note50"></a>Note</h3><p>You can also query whether a specified key exists by using the <code class="literal">HasKey</code> function: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.HasKey.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.HasKey.html</a>.</p></div><p>Remember, if your game creates keys using <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code>, these settings normally remain even after your game is uninstalled and removed from the computer. For example, uninstalling your game on Windows will not, by default, remove all related registry keys. Likewise, uninstalling your game on Android will not remove all cached user data. You can manually delete specific keys by using <code class="literal">DeleteKey</code>, and all keys using the <code class="literal">DeleteAll</code> function, but these are only effective when the user or game takes active steps to remove keys. Sometimes, the gamer will simply delete your game without considering that user data should be uninstalled. In these cases, all user data saved with <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> remains on the system, unless removed manually!</p></div>
