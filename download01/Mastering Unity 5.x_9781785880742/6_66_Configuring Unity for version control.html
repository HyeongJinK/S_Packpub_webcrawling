Git is configured to work with nearly any kind of file, both text and binary (non-text). However, there are some optimization steps we can take to enhance your Git workflow inside Unity. To get started, open your Unity <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor </strong></span>from the application menu. This displays the Unity Editor preferences in the Object Inspector.</p><p>

</p><p>Accessing the Editor Settings</p><p>Next, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Version Control</strong></span> mode from <span class="strong"><strong>Hidden Meta Files</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Visible Meta Files</strong></span>. By default, the Hidden Meta Files option applies the <span class="emphasis"><em>hidden </em></span>tag to all meta-files, excluding them from version control. Meta-files are additional files Unity generates to accompany all assets (like <span class="emphasis"><em>Textures</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Meshes,</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Sounds</em></span>) and include configuration options and preferences, like texture quality and UV Mapping. These files are named with the <code class="literal">.meta </code>extension. When meta files are hidden, Git will not include them in the Repo. This means that any other users accessing the Repo on a different computer will not have the meta-files. This causes Unity to regenerate a new set of meta-files when the project is opened. That is not necessarily problematic, but can lead to longer loading times when opening Unity projects. Thus, using <span class="emphasis"><em>Visible Meta Files </em></span>can enhance collaborative Unity development.</p><p>

</p><p>Using Visible Meta Files</p><p>Now change the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Serialization</strong></span> mode from <span class="strong"><strong>Mixed</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Force Text</strong></span>. This changes how Unity saves metadata files, including scene files. By using <span class="strong"><strong>Force Text</strong></span>, Unity saves all metadata in a human-readable text-based format. This has benefits with Git version control, as we'll see later.</p><p>

</p><p>Using Force Text mode</p><p>You can confirm that Unity is using text mode for asset serialization by opening a scene file inside a text editor. The file will consist only of text instructions and definitions. This does not change how the scene appears in the viewport or during gameplay but only how the data is stored in the file.</p><p>

</p><p>Previewing a Scene File as a Text Asset</p><p>Finally, before making any commits to GitKraken, be sure to exit and close Unity. This is because Unity generates temporary files while running, and it can also open and edit metadata files. Consequently, close Unity and then Commit to GitKraken.</p><p>
