<span class="strong"><strong>Project Management</strong></span> is really important. We all have to do it to some extent in our everyday lives, but especially when developing games. We must think carefully about the work needed, and then figure out the most practicable way to pursue it. Project Management is, essentially, about planning your time, workload and resources to achieve success optimally. The idea is to identify all the work needed, and then to divide it into a sequence of manageable chunks. The following terms and phrases emerge with the Project Management process.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec62"></a>Research, design, and work assessment</h3></div></div></div><p>Project Management begins by careful analysis of the design. This involves examining the <span class="strong"><strong>game design document</strong></span> (a clear statement of the game) and determining how, when properly conceived, it can be implemented optimally. Previous chapters outlined the design for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, and from this, we can extrapolate various levels of work. Try thinking about these, and then write them down using a tree structure. At the highest level, you should include art, sound, and development work. Within the development, for example, we have many systems to develop, from player controls and enemy AI to level logic and camera systems, plus lots more. The degree to which you can dig down into lower levels of work is, potentially, endless. For this reason, you'll need to make informed decisions about when to stop digging, by arriving at small, achievable <span class="strong"><strong>tasks</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>tickets</strong></span>) that can be fully assigned to specific team members within a reasonable <span class="strong"><strong>deadline</strong></span>.</p><p>

</p><p>Project work hierarchy</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec63"></a>Workload plan</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>workload plan</strong></span> begins when you have atomized the full workload into discrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned to specific team members, like: <span class="emphasis"><em>create player controls</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>animate a walk cycle for a character model</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>create brick texture</em></span>, and so on. Each task will have an <span class="emphasis"><em>assignee</em></span> (a person responsible for its completion), and a <span class="emphasis"><em>deadline</em></span> (the time and date the task should be completed). In addition, the Project Manager should arrange tasks sequentially in a timeline or <span class="emphasis"><em>calendar</em></span>, representing the order in which they should be completed: after all, there's no point texturing a character model before the model has actually been made!</p><p>

</p><p>Task progression</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec64"></a>Task status</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has a <span class="strong"><strong>status</strong></span> within the development timeline, representing how far (or not) work has progressed. The exact name and nature of a status varies from project to project, but there are some general states that a task can be. First, a task can be in a <span class="strong"><strong>To-Do</strong></span> state. This means a task exists in the plan, has been assigned, but has not yet been started by the assignee. Thus, it's on their list of things <span class="emphasis"><em>to do</em></span>. Next, a task can be <span class="strong"><strong>In Progress</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>; which means the task is currently being addressed by the assignee. And finally, a Task can be <span class="strong"><strong>Completed</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Closed</strong></span>. This means the task has, in the judgment of both the assignee and the team, been completed according to the plan, and the assignee is now working on something else. Sometimes, however, a task can be <span class="strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Suspended</strong></span>.</p><p>This happens when a task  was started but cannot now be completed. This can be caused by an oversight from the Project Manager (perhaps not all necessary tasks were planned), or an unfortunate disruption to the workload (a team member fell ill). Most often, it is caused when <span class="emphasis"><em>tasks</em></span> depend on each other, and an assignee for another related task has fallen behind schedule so that you are now waiting for them to complete it. The <span class="strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span> status is not usually a persistent state; it typically changes back to <span class="strong"><strong>In Progress</strong></span> when the blocking condition is removed.</p><p>

</p><p>Task status</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec65"></a>Risk Analysis</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has associated <span class="emphasis"><em>risks</em></span>, which should be stated, and these risks can vary in kind. Sometimes, the risk will be financial: How much time and money will task-completion cost, and is it worth it? Sometimes, the risk will be technical: What software, hardware, and skills are needed to complete the task to the required standard? Sometimes the risk will be logistical or economic: Will task completion satisfy a market demand? There can be other risks too, but each risk outlines a potential problem that is foreseen, with a reasonable probability, and it should further recommend a solution to the problem or, at least, a workaround. <span class="strong"><strong>Solutions</strong></span> define how to solve and tackle problems, and <span class="strong"><strong>workarounds</strong></span> define ways of working so that difficult problems are not encountered at all.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec66"></a>Resources and skills needed</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has requisites, and not just in terms of other tasks. These are all the things needed to complete the task on-time and to the specified standard. Each task requires software (like Unity, Blender, MonoDevelop and so on), hardware, skills, finances and time. <span class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> itself is a <span class="emphasis"><em>wasting resource</em></span> meaning that it cannot be refunded once it's spent. This makes time a particularly expensive resource.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec67"></a>Testing plan</h3></div></div></div><p>It's easy to underestimate the testing work for any project. After the game is developed, people must spend time testing it, searching for bugs and issues. It's important to allocate time for testing in advance by creating a testing plan as part of the development schedule. The plan should include tasks specifically for testing. You'll need to test specific components and features, as well as general testing. In addition, you should allocate time for debugging and fixing any problems found. This can be difficult when estimating time and deadlines because you're allocating time for unknown bugs with unknown solutions. As a result, allocate the maximum time your schedule allows for testing.</p></div></div>
