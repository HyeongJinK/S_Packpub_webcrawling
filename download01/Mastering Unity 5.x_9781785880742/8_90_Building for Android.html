There are different ways to do this. Here, we'll look at a method that'll work for most Android devices, even if you cannot connect your device to Unity. Firstly, access the Player Settings by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> from the application menu, and assign the application a unique <span class="emphasis"><em>Bundle Identifier</em></span>, by entering a name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span> field. This is used to uniquely identify the Android application, and would also be used on an App Store.</p><p>

</p><p>Assigning the application a Bundle Identifier</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note62"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember, before creating your Android game, always check out the App Store submission guidelines to make sure your product will be accepted: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.recovery-android.com/enable-usb-debugging-on-android.html#part2" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/launch-checklist.html</a>.</p></div><p>Next, to build the application, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the application menu. When the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog appears, you have the choice of <span class="strong"><strong>Build </strong></span>or <span class="strong"><strong>Build and Run</strong></span>. By choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Build and Run</strong></span>, the application is compiled and then sent immediately to the connected Android device for running. By choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> only, the application is compiled to a standalone <span class="strong"><strong>APK</strong></span> file (which is an <span class="strong"><strong>Android Executable Package</strong></span>). Choose <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span>, and then select a destination folder on the computer outside the project folder. The <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> method does not require an Android device to be connected.</p><p>

</p><p>Building an APK file</p><p>If you click <span class="strong"><strong>Build </strong></span>now you may get an error, as <span class="strong"><strong>Android </strong></span>Compilation requires the <span class="strong"><strong>JDK </strong></span>(<span class="strong"><strong>Java Development Kit</strong></span>) to be installed. To achieve that, you can download the JDK online from: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/launch-checklist.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note63"></a>Note</h3><p>Before downloading and installing the JDK, or any software, please ensure that you check out their End User License agreements!</p></div><p>After installing the JDK, access the <span class="strong"><strong>User Preferences</strong></span> dialog by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> from the application menu, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>External Tools</strong></span> tab. From here, specify the JDK location in the JDK field.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_047.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Specifying the JDK location from the Unity Preferences dialog</p><p>Now click <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog, and this will produce an Android compliant APK file. Remember, the APK only supports Android platforms specified by the <span class="strong"><strong>Minimum API Level</strong></span>, defined in the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> settings window.</p><p>

</p><p>Defining APK platform support</p><p>When the build process is completed, an APK file appears, representing the compiled Android executable.</p><p>

</p><p>Building an APK file</p><p>You can transfer the APK to your device storage by portable media, such as an SD card, through cloud storage, or by direct transfer through a USB connection. To install and run the APK on the device, however, you must first enable a third party (or Unknown) application source, allowing custom-made applications to be installed. See the following link for instructions on this (the steps vary between OS version): <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.applivery.com/blog/android-unknown-sources/</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note64"></a>Note</h3><p>Enabling Unknown Sources allows applications from many sources to be installed. To improve security, consider re-enabling this option after installing your Unity project.</p></div><p>After enabling <span class="strong"><strong>Unknown Sources</strong></span> for application installs, you can install your APK application by using the APK Installer app, available for free from the Play Store, here: <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apkinstaller.ApkInstaller&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apkinstaller.ApkInstaller&amp;hl=en_GB</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>Downloading the Android APK Installer</p><p>Excellent work! You can now install and run APK applications to your Android device. This lets you build and test your Unity projects on real Android hardware, and not just through emulation in the editor. When developing for mobiles, testing in-editor is always a great first step, for visualization and convenience, but the device itself should always be the benchmark against which performance and usability is measured.</p></div>
