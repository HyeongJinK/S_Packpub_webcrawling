This process involves making animations using the animation editor, developing animation graphs with <span class="strong"><strong>Mecanim</strong></span>, creating user interface elements with Unity UI, and scripting core functionality in <span class="emphasis"><em>C#</em></span>. Let's start by clarifying how the player controls work for the majority of gameplay. The player has two main input types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>They have limited control over how the camera moves and when it moves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>They can press alphanumeric keys on the keyboard to spell words during combat with zombies</p></li></ul></div><p>These two input types are now considered in more depth.</p></div>
