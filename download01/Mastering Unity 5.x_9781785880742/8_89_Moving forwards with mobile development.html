After a long configuration process, you're now ready to start developing for Android within Unity. To start, you should change the Target Development platform within the Unity editor. To do this, select <span class="strong"><strong>File | Build Settings...</strong></span> to access the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings...</strong></span> dialog.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_039.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Accessing the Build Settings...</p><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings... </strong></span>dialog, select the Android platform from the platform list, and then choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button. On selecting this, Unity rebuilds, re-imports, and re-configures all assets for the Target Platform.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_08_040.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Switch platforms</p><p>You can confirm the selected platform from the application title bar. The Target OS will be listed in brackets. This should read <code class="literal">Android</code>.</p><p>

</p><p>Confirming the target operating system</p><p>Depending on your application, target hardware, and <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span>, your scenes may look different in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab, as a result of rendering capabilities and supported rendering modes for the target hardware. In some cases, you may need to re-bake light mapping, occlusion culling data, or navigation mesh data. In addition, you may need to adjust the supported rendering API. First, determine what the minimum Android specification is, specifying this explicitly from the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> settings window. Aim for the highest level possible that is consistent with your target hardware and testing device, as this will give you the widest feature support possible.</p><p>

</p><p>Selecting the Minimum API Level for the target hardware</p><p>After selecting the API level, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering API</strong></span> to use. By default, this is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic, </strong></span>and when this is specified, Unity detects your graphics needs and selects the lowest API consistent with them. However, if your scene is not rendering as intended, you may need to change this. To do that, remove the check mark from the <span class="strong"><strong>Auto Graphics API </strong></span>checkbox, and select an API from the list.</p><p>

</p><p>Selecting a graphics API</p><p>You should also check out which Rendering Emulation mode is being used by the editor to render your scene in the viewports. Ideally, this should match the Rendering API you are using (from the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> settings window), to get the highest fidelity results between what you see in the viewport and what you'll get on the device. To access the Rendering Emulation, select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics Emulation</strong></span> from the application menu, and then choose the API level needed.</p><p>
