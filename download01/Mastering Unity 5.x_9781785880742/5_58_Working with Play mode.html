You should specifically test that the player can approach a zombie, that a zombie can chase and attack the player, and that the player can attack and defeat enemies:</p><p>

</p><p>Working in Play mode</p><p>During testing you may decide to make changes, tweaking speeds, stopping distances, health points, and more. Remember, any changes made in <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode are automatically reverted when playback is stopped. However, you can copy values on components from Play Mode to edit Mode. This makes it easier to adjust values from the Inspector and to take them back to edit Mode. To do this, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Cog </strong></span>icon from the component being changed, during Play mode, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Copy Component</strong></span> from the menu:</p><p>

</p><p>Copying component values</p><p>Then, back in edit mode, select the same component and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Cog i</strong></span>con. From the context menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Component Values</strong></span>. This copies the values between the modes, allowing you to retain your changes from Play mode:</p><p>

</p><p>Pasting component values</p><p>In addition, when testing in Play mode, it can be easy to forget that we're actually in Play mode. There, we can make changes, and then later realize we made them in Play mode and should not have done so. This can be frustrating. However, Unity does offer us something to mitigate this problem. We can use a feature (<span class="strong"><strong>Play Mode Tint</strong></span>) to colorize the interface while in Play mode, helping us to remember the currently active mode. To access this feature, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span>

</p><p>Accessing User Preferences</p><p>From the User <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Colors</strong></span> tab. Click inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Playmode tint</strong></span> swatch and select a color for the interface:</p><p>

</p><p>Selecting Playmode tint</p><p>Now press Play from the application tool bar to launch Play mode, and the interface is immediately colorized with the tint color:</p><p>
