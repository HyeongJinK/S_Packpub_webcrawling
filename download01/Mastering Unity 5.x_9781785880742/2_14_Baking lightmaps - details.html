To do this, enable <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong></span> and tweak the <span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance</strong></span> field until you get the volumetric effect desired. This requires rebaking. Ambient Occlusion is sometimes called <span class="strong"><strong>Contact Shadows</strong></span> because it generates shadows where two or more solid bodies meet, such as the floor meeting the wall, or crevices and cracks. This creates a volume effect, enhancing the 3D-feel of a scene.</p><p>

</p><p>Enabling Ambient Occlusion</p><p>In addition, enable <span class="strong"><strong>Final Gather</strong></span>. Set the <span class="strong"><strong>Ray Count</strong></span> to <code class="literal">256</code>. Final Gather reduces noise and improves the quality of lightmapping. Higher values result in smooth, higher quality output, at the expense of the calculation time.</p><p>

</p><p>Enabling Final Gather</p><p>Finally, you can increase the resolution of specific objects, if needed. We don't need this for DK, but if you have large, eye catching and very important objects in a scene (such as a golden throne or majestic statue), you'll probably want these to receive more lighting detail than obscure areas in darkened regions. Specifically, you'll want to give some objects more lightmap texture space than others. To achieve this, select the object in the scene, to receive more or less detail, and then switch to the<span class="strong"><strong> Object</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting </strong></span>window. From here, set the object's <span class="strong"><strong>Scale in Lightmap</strong></span> field. By default, all objects have a scale of <code class="literal">1</code>. However, you can raise and lower an object's scale, for each object to increase or reduce its detail, respectively. The value <code class="literal">0.5</code> is half detailed, <code class="literal">2</code> is double detail, and so on.</p><p>

</p><p>Lightmap scaling</p><p>Now you're ready for the final scene bake! Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button, and the final lightmaps are generated. Remember, if you later upgrade to a different version of Unity, you'll probably need to rebake the scene.</p><p>
