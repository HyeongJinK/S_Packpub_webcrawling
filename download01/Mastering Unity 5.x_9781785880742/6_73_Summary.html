You can now use Trello and Version Control (Git) to manage your work more effectively. This helps you streamline your workflow so that you can do more with less time. Trello lets you project manage and time-block your work successfully, while Git lets you track theÂ development of your project, both locally and remotely, and you can rewind progress to retrieve earlier states if needed. Both tools are incredibly powerful, so make them your friends!</p></div>
