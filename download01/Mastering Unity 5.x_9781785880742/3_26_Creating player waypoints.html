The second type is explored in the next chapter. In building movement functionality, we'll bring together many Unity features operating harmoniously - including animation, Mecanim, scripting, and others. We'll start by creating empty objects (empties) in the scene, representing important locations for the camera to stop at on its journey from the beginning of the level to the end. These are locations of <span class="emphasis"><em>attack </em></span>and <span class="emphasis"><em>ambush</em></span>; where zombies approach for combat. When a combat sequence is completed (by killing all zombies), the camera is free to move forward at the player's prompting. To create waypoints, create an empty object for each stopping point, then parent all of those to a single object for organization. I have created five stopping points for the first level: <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span>. These empties are primarily for reference and not for scripting purposes; they help us easily remember where the camera should stop, in terms of <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> location (3D coordinates).</p><p>

</p><p>Creating waypoint objects</p><p>By default, empties are created without any visual representation in the view port, except for a gizmo axis that appears when selected. You can, however, assign the objects a custom icon or graphic via the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> to make them permanently visible and easily selectable. Select each empty by clicking on it in the view port, or from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, and then, from the object <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, click the avatar icon.</p><p>

</p><p>Customizing game object icons</p><p>From here, you can select various icons for display. The topmost, horizontal icons (named icons) show the object name in the view port, in addition to a solid background color and the squarer icons beneath display only icons. You can also click the <span class="strong"><strong>Other...</strong></span> button to browse the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel for a texture to display instead. For <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, I'll simply choose the named icons.</p><p>

</p><p>Selecting a named icon</p><p>Now we've established waypoint objects for the camera track. These objects are for our reference only when animating the camera through the level. We'll turn to that subject next.</p></div>
