There are many tools available, ranging in features, complexity and cost. Here, we'll focus on <span class="strong"><strong>Trello</strong></span>, a free web-based work management program. You can access Trello from its official homepage at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">http://www.trello.com</a>. Trello lets you design your workload using a vertical, column-based <span class="strong"><strong>Kanban</strong></span> board, as we'll see. More information on a Kanban Board can be found online at: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>Accessing Trello</p><p>After signing up to Trello you should create a new team. A <span class="emphasis"><em>team</em></span> represents a collection of Trello users who can share site content together for collaboration. It's a good idea to add all members of your team, so everybody can view and track project progress. To do this, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Create a new team...</strong></span> button from the main interface.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_005-e1484025884750.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a new project</p><p>Assign your team a meaningful name and description, clearly outlining the project to be created in a way that's accessible to everybody on the team. Take your time writing an appropriate title and description. These small details are important and make a big difference to how people see and value your project.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Describing a new project</p><p>Now you've created a team and the contents can be shared by one or more Trello users. Let's start by adding members to the team, where needed. To do this, switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Members</strong></span> tab, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add by Name or Email</strong></span> to add a single and specific user, or else choose <span class="strong"><strong>Bulk Add Members</strong></span> to paste in a list of e-mail addresses and add members in the block.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Adding team members</p><p>After adding all your team members, you're ready to create a new board. A good approach is to create a single board for each team member and their work. Sometimes you'll need more if the workload is heavy. Each board works like a billboard or notice board where notes, pictures, tasks and information can be viewed and changed by the team. To create a board, just click the <span class="strong"><strong>Create new board...</strong></span> option from the website menu; or use the <span class="strong"><strong>Boards</strong></span> tab from the team page.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a new board</p><p>Every new board begins empty; clear of all tasks and information. At this point, we should first structure the board, to arrange our tasks and deadlines within an established framework. One approach is to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Kaban</strong></span> method. This refers to a vertical column format in which four columns are created: To-Do, In Progress, Completed, and Blocked. Tasks are then moved individually, like sticky notes, between the columns as they are started and completed. This helps us easily visualize the status of particular tasks in the workload. To get started using the Kanban method, click <span class="strong"><strong>Add a list...</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Boards</strong></span> page.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a new list</p><p>Each created list needs a name. Name them: <span class="strong"><strong>To-Do</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>In-Progress</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Completed</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span>. Arrange the lists from left to right chronologically. You can drop and drop the lists to reorder them if needed.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a Kanban board</p><p>Having created a Kanban board, it's time to add tasks to the list. Trello names them <span class="strong"><strong>Cards</strong></span>. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>To-Do</strong></span> list, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add a card...</strong></span> button on the list.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip40"></a>Tip</h3><p>All newly created tasks should begin in the <span class="strong"><strong>To-Do</strong></span> list.</p></div><p>Give the card an appropriate name for the task. I'll start by creating some coding/development tasks. Once named, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button. We can adjust its properties afterwards.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_011-e1484026811163.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a new development card</p><p>Now the first task has been created, let's adjust its properties: Add an assignee and a Deadline, as well as notes and any attached information. To do that, click the Pen icon to edit the task's properties.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_012-e1484026835675.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Accessing a task's properties</p><p>Let's first assign the task a deadline (due date). Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Change Due Date</strong></span> button, and then select a date from the <span class="strong"><strong>Calendar</strong></span> field. Be sure to assign all tasks a deadline because a real, concrete date applied to a task helps you focus on getting the task completed. <span class="emphasis"><em>Deadlines</em></span> protect you from procrastination and putting off tasks to an unspecified time.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_013.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Setting a task deadline</p><p>Now let's assign the task a team member, and apply a label to it. <span class="strong"><strong>Labels</strong></span> let you color code tasks to <span class="emphasis"><em>visualize importance</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>priority</em></span>. The color red should indicate high-priority. Click <span class="strong"><strong>Team Members</strong></span> to assign members to the task, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>Labels</strong></span> to choose a color.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_014.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Applying labels to a task</p><p>Completing some tasks may involve multiple steps or discrete stages: for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Enemy AI</em></span> can be broken into the implementation of several states (Patrol, Chase, Attack, and Death) as we've seen in earlier chapters. We add these details to a task through <span class="strong"><strong>checklists</strong></span>, where each state can be <span class="emphasis"><em>checked-off</em></span> by the assignee as the relevant work is completed. To do this, click on the task name from the list, and then choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Checklist</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> dialog:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_015.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Creating a checklist</p><p>Assign the checklist a unique and meaningful name. Then, from the Checklist creator, add checklist fields for each of the <span class="strong"><strong>AI States</strong></span>. Name these items: <code class="literal">Patrol</code>, <code class="literal">Chase</code>, <code class="literal">Attack</code>, and <code class="literal">Dead</code>. Be sure to click the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button after naming each state, adding the state to the checklist.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_016.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Adding checklist Items...</p><p>Now, by activating the checkboxes in the list, you increment the progress status of the task. This appears both in the progress bar view from the properties dialog, and in the summary view from the tasks list. This is a handy way to keep track of progress for specific tasks.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_017.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Making progress with checklists</p><p>You can also use the <span class="strong"><strong>Subscribe </strong></span>option on another member's task to be automatically notified by e-mail whenever progress or changes are made to the task status. This is useful if you have many people to keep track of and don't want to repeatedly log in to Trello to review their status.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_018.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Subscribing to a task</p><p>Now repeat the process to create more <span class="emphasis"><em>tasks</em></span>, building up a workload schedule for the complete Dead Keys project. As you add more tasks and populate the Trello board, you'll be able to move tasks between columns to reflect their completion status. Great work! Being able to project manage your work collaboratively in this visual way will help you work faster and empower your team, especially when different members are located in different countries and time-zones.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_019.jpg" /></div><p>
