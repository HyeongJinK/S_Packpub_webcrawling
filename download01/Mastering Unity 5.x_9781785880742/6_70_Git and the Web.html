Sometimes, other developers will be working in the same room, office, or building. And, when they are, you can connect with them through an internal server or network. But often, developers will be located across the globe, working in different countries and time zones. All of them still need access to the same code and files, however; and thus, all of them need access to the same Git Repo. This allows developers to access shared files, make commits and upload branches. To achieve this, we'll need to use a Remote Repository, as opposed to a Local Repository. In Git a Repo can be either Remote or Local. A Local Repo is saved on your local hard drive, while a Remote Repo is accessed from a web server. When working with a Remote Repo, users often take a <span class="emphasis"><em>local copy</em></span> of the Remote Repo (a Clone), and use the Clone to make changes which can be uploaded later back to the Remote Repo (the Remote).</p><p>To create a Remote Repo, you can use a freely available service, like GitHub or BitBucket. These let you host a Git Repo, with some file size and usage restrictions. This book focuses on creating a Remote Repo with Bitbucket, and then on using this Repo with GitKraken to upload and download files. So, let's get started. First, you'll need a free account at BitBucket - be sure to check the terms and conditions before joining. BitBucket can be accessed from <a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/product" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/product</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>BitBucket is a free service that lets you host Git Repositories</p><p>After opening a BitBucket account you can easily link this to your GitKraken application. To do this, open <span class="emphasis"><em>GitKraken</em></span> and, from the application menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span>
<span class="emphasis"><em> | </em></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> on Windows, or <span class="strong"><strong>GitKraken </strong></span>
<span class="emphasis"><em>| </em></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> on Mac. This opens the User Preferences Window.</p><p>

</p><p>Accessing GitKraken preferences</p><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>User Preferences </strong></span>Window, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Authentication</strong></span> tab and then choose the <span class="strong"><strong>BitBucket </strong></span>tab. From here, you can enter your BitBucket credentials to link the application.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_078.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Entering your GitKraken Credentials</p><p>Having linked GitKraken to BitBucket you can now create new Repositories and clone existing ones. Let's create a new Remote Repo, and then clone it. To do this, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Init </strong></span>option from the GitKraken start screen, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>BitBucket.org</strong></span> tab instead of the <span class="strong"><strong>Local</strong></span> tab (chosen previously).</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_079-e1484034166886.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Initializing a New Remote Repo on BitBucket</p><p>From the<span class="strong"><strong> Init</strong></span> menu, select your <span class="strong"><strong>BitBucket</strong></span> account and then enter a new name for Repo to create, along with a description and <span class="strong"><strong>Access</strong></span> level. <span class="strong"><strong>Public</strong></span> repositories are accessible to the public, while <span class="strong"><strong>Private</strong></span> repos can only be accessed by approved users.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785880742/graphics/image_06_080.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Completing the creation details for a BitBucket Repo</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Clone after Init </strong></span>option determines whether GitKraken should generate a <span class="emphasis"><em>local copy</em></span> of the new Repo on the computer. If activated, a copy is created after the Repo is created. I'll leave this option activated.</p><p>

</p><p>Cloning the Git Repo after creation</p><p>When you're ready, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Repository</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Clone </strong></span>button. This first generates a Remote Repo on the BitBucket serve and then generates a local copy (Clone).</p><p>

</p><p>Generating a new Repo</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"></a>Note</h3><p>If authentication fails for BitBucket, make sure you're logged in via the BitBucket website.</p></div><p>After generating the Repo, a version is created on the server, and a local clone is created on your computer too. You can confirm the remote Repo has been created via the BitBucket website. Choose <span class="strong"><strong>Repositories </strong></span>from the top-level menu on the website to a see a list of the created Repos.</p><p>
