Without testing for player comprehension, we<a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a> cannot assess quantitatively how much learning has occurred, so a form of player interaction is necessary; the NPCs presenting the quiz cards fills this role. This is the source of challenge in the game.</p><p>The other <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>racers chasing the player through the course add a level of pressure on the player. This is the source of intensity or pressure in the game.</p><p>Recall that testing and pressure are the two parameters necessary to create a learning environment that encourages cognitive flow. Having constructed our level according to this model, we can adjust the difficulty of the quiz questions and the speed of the other players to influence the fun and learning effectiveness of the game.</p></div>
