Name the new folder <code class="literal">NpcQuestions</code>.</p></li><li><p>Implement 50 unique NPC Dialog cards based on this Prefab, which in turn is based on the trivia content embedded in the <code class="literal">Flag</code> pop ups from <code class="literal">LEVEL1</code>; they will form the basis for the dialog in this mission.</p></li><li><p>Keep the associations to the <code class="literal">popup_QuizFailedQuestion</code> Prefab for the incorrect answers on these cards. For the correct selection, instantiate a unique and appropriate <code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code> Prefab.</p></li><li><p>Each <code class="literal">QuizCard</code> should have a unique <code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code> card. In this way, the player can see a contextually relevant response from you as you reply to the player. This gives an excellent opportunity to reinforce the learning material because it gives you a way to rephrase, restate, and reinforce the facts.</p></li><li><p>Make sure that each <code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code> card has an action to add points for every correct button click. Not only is this required for the mission to have an end condition, but this is also another way in which we reward the player for performing correctly. Remember, we can build a positive response in the learner with simple positive reinforcement with points and a dialog that furthers the story.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_09_13.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! Associating each QuizNpc's <span class="strong"><strong>Instantiate</strong></span> button action with the corresponding <code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code> card forms the brunt of the labor in creating mission three. Remember that <a id="id479" class="indexterm"></a>Prefabs can only store associations with other Prefabs; be prudent to not drag-and-drop associations with actual instances of these classes themselves.</p></div>
