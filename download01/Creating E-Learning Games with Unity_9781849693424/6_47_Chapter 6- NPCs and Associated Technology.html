To do this, we will populate the game world with some non-player characters (otherwise known as NPCs) for the user to interact with. These are characters or actors in your game scene that the player can interact with during gameplay, but not control directly. You may find these referred to as AI Characters in other texts; however, these terms are synonymous.</p><p>In this chapter, we will build an NPC class to handle the choreography of these actors and their actions. To support the NPC system, we will develop a framework to define a smooth curve for the actors to travel on. We will also apply the FSM concepts from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mission One – Future Proofing the Code</em></span>, as we implement a data-driven behavior system; this will enable fast design and tweaking of NPC behavior inside the Unity Editor. Lastly, we will integrate these classes and construct Prefab objects to make the task of populating the world quick and simple.</p><p>The following topics will covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the NPC GameObject</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing the <code class="literal">SplineMgr</code> class</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Connecting <code class="literal">SplineMgr</code> to <code class="literal">npcScript</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing the NPC decision system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building a collection of NPC conditions and responses</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Putting it all together</p></li></ul></div></div>
