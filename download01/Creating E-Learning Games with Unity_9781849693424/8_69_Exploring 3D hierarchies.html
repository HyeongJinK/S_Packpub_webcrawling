So far, in this book, we have seen how hierarchies can be used as a means of associating objects with one another and organizing them into hierarchies. One example of this is the character Prefabs with their child hats we developed for the player Prefab and the racers. In this example, by dragging-and-dropping the hat object onto the player's body, we associated the hat with the object body by putting the child into the parent's coordinate system. After doing this, we saw that the rotations, translations, and scales of the body's transform component were propagated to the hat. In practice, this is how we attach objects to one another in 3D games, that is, by parenting them to different parents and thereby changing their coordinate systems or frames of reference.</p><p>Another example of using hierarchies as a data structure was for collections. Examples of this are the <code class="literal">splineData</code> collections we developed for the NPCs. These objects had a single game object at the<a id="id409" class="indexterm"></a> head and a collection of data as child objects. We could then perform operations on the head, which lets us process all of the child objects in the collection (in our case, installing the way points).</p><p>A third use of hierarchies was for animation. Since rotations, translations, and scales that are applied to a parent transform are propagated to all of the children, we have a way of developing fine-tuned motion for a hierarchy of objects. It turns out that characters in games and animated objects alike use this <span class="emphasis"><em>hierarchy of transforms</em></span> technique to implement their motion.</p></div>
