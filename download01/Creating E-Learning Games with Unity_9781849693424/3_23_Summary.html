We also reviewed a model of fun and "gamification" and how this model can be used in e-learning games to design content that will present and encourage consolidation of learning objectives in the user.</p><p>Going forward, we will review our code thus far, and make some maintenance changes to future proof the code, ensuring we can extend it and that it will remain suitable for subsequent e-learning games with a different content.</p></div>
