We have shown examples of how components attached to GameObject can communicate with one another. We have extensively used the list container and the search pattern to implement tracking and inventory maintenance methods. Going forward, we will use these systems in conjunction with a little applied psychology and gamification theory to develop the first mission in our game.</p></div>
