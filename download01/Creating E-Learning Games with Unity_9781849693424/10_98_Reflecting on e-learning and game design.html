Our game has four scene files (<code class="literal">MAIN</code>, <code class="literal">LEVEL1</code>, <code class="literal">LEVEL2</code>, and <code class="literal">LEVEL3</code>). In the <code class="literal">MAIN</code> scene file lives the <code class="literal">_global</code> object hierarchy that holds the singleton class instances in the game: systems such as the <code class="literal">Player</code>, <code class="literal">Camera</code>, <code class="literal">Game</code>, and <code class="literal">Light</code>. Not only is this scene file the entry point to our game, but these objects persist as other level-specific scenes are loaded and unloaded.</p><p>Level 1 is the Find the Flags mission, wherein the user is taught about state names, state flags, and state trivia. As each flag is picked up, a trivia card is presented and placed in the inventory. The user can then click on these cards and review the trivia card throughout the game.</p><p>Level 2 is the Zombie Race level, wherein the user is quizzed on their retention of the material from Level 1. Adding an element of pressure to the game is the fact that zombies are chasing the player (they want to win the race before you do). Along the race, the player must interact with NPCs who quiz them on state flags. We explore the concept of cognitive flow and how to encourage the player to achieve this state of total engagement. We determine that to maximize flow, we need to design testing scenarios with tasks that are moderately challenging and that contain an element of tension or pressure.</p><p>Level 3 is the Park Ranger level, where the player has to race against a clock, find park visitors, and apply their knowledge to help each one with their question. Manipulating learned material at a level higher than memorization is an activity known to support long-term learning.</p><p>While this three-stage loop is used in the traditional classroom as well as in e-learning games to teach facts, it is also a great structure to teach game mechanics or other types of skills to the learner.</p></div>
