Name the scene <code class="literal">TESTBED2</code>. Inside this scene, let's add two empty game objects at the root level, placed at (0,0,0) as with the first level. Name them <span class="strong"><strong>_global</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>_level2</strong></span>.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>_global</strong></span>, add the layer, camera, and GameObject. Recall that these objects and their scripts persist across all levels.</p></li><li><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>_level2</strong></span>, we will add level 2's specific GameObjects. As we create them throughout this chapter, we will add them to the hierarchy formed with the object named <span class="strong"><strong>_level2</strong></span> as the root.</p><p>The following objects will be placed in this hierarchy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>_splineDataA</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>_splineDataB</strong></span>: These are two collections of control points for the spline systems that racerA and racerB will use to follow smooth paths during the race.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>GiantFlagFinish</strong></span>: This is the large two-poled flag object representing the finish line.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>LevelLogicObj</strong></span>: This is the GameObject that contains the logic that will track the player's progress in the mission and dispatch either a success or failure condition based on this. This GameObject will also have a <span class="strong"><strong>GiantFlagStart</strong></span> GameObject as a child, representing the starting line in the scene.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>NpcLocators</strong></span>: This is a collection of positions where NPCs will be randomly placed at the start of the mission. This operates similarly to the flag locators in mission one.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>racerA</strong></span>: This is an NPC GameObject that will race against the player.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>racerB</strong></span>: This is an NPC GameObject that will race against the player.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span>: This is the terrain mesh that represents the park grounds in this level (mission two).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>setupLevel2</strong></span>: This is the GameObject instance that configures the level for play on start and starts the race.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>raceStarter</strong></span>: This is the GameObject instance that controls the start time of the race.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>TriviaCards</strong></span>: A number of trivia cards (one for each state) will be made that show the four flags to the player and ask him or her to pick the correct one for the given state name.</p></li></ul></div></li></ol></div></div>
