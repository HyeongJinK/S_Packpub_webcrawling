While we have made our game framework more flexible and extensible, we have also broken some assumptions from before that need repairing as discussed in the following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <code class="literal">MissionManager</code> class has been renamed to <code class="literal">Game</code>. This means that all scripts that used to do a <code class="literal">GameObject.Find("MissionManager")</code> need to be updated to <code class="literal">Find("Game")</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We have separated some objects into the <code class="literal">MAIN</code> scene and some into the <code class="literal">LEVEL1</code> scene. This means that objects that have a reference to an object that is now in another scene will be broken. To repair these, we need to modify the code for the object in the scene. See <code class="literal">SetupSceneOne</code> for an example of this.</p></li></ul></div></div>
