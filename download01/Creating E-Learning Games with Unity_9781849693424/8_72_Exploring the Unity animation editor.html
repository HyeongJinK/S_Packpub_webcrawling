Unity provides a general-purpose animation tool that lets us script the position, orientation, and even the state of public variables on other scripts. This tool is well suited for simple animated objects and other in-game choreography. It uses a simpler non-visual animation system to play the animation but it still has many uses. Let's use this tool to add some animation to the starting banner.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Left-click on <span class="strong"><strong>pole2</strong></span> of the <code class="literal">GiantFlagStart</code> Prefab instance.</p></li><li><p>Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>You will be presented with a timeline editor window, which will look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_21.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>The animation editor window presents the user with a tool to author and preview custom animations inside of the Unity tool itself (rather than inside of a 3D modeling package). These animations can be applied to any GameObject that has public properties. All of the components, with the public variables on the GameObject that you have selected, will appear at the left-hand side of the screen. We can now apply the curve data to them over the timeline to build custom animations.</p></li><li><p>Click on the red record button in the upper-left corner of the animation editor to begin creating a custom animation.</p></li><li><p>The system will warn you that it needs to add the animation component (not animator) and<a id="id450" class="indexterm"></a> that this will break your Prefab reference. Go ahead and allow the editor to add the component. We will update the Prefab once we are done.</p></li><li><p>The animation editor uses curves to modify data over time. Click on the x component of the transform and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Curve</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_22.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, by adding control points to these curves, we can animate the parameters of the object. Let's create a simple symmetric oscillation for the pole so that it shakes the banner in an interesting way.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_23.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once you are happy with your animation, toggle the record button to stop the recording. You<a id="id451" class="indexterm"></a> will notice a new animation in your <code class="literal">assets</code> folder with the name you provided when you first clicked on record.</p></li><li><p>Drag-and-drop this animation into the first <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> field of the animation component on the pole object. Note that while this component supports playing and blending between multiple animations, it must be driven through scripting.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Play Automatically</strong></span> checkbox is enabled to see your animation, without having to tie it to any script.</p></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! You have now successfully created a custom animation with the in-editor animation tool. To take this to the next level, feel free to explore the different playback modes on the animation assets themselves as well as ways of firing off methods from an animation curve with events. Remember, even slight changes to the properties of GameObjects in the scene will be recorded as animations</p></div>
