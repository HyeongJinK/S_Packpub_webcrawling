It is well suited for the in-game HUD text that stays relatively stationary on the screen. It is displayed in screen-relative coordinates.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">GUITexture</code>: This <a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a>component displays a 2D image in screen space. It is well<a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a> suited for the background and border graphics for in-game HUD elements. Just as the preceding component, this component is also displayed in screen-relative coordinates.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">TextMesh</code>: This <a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a>component generates a 3D mesh for a<a id="id250" class="indexterm"></a> given string and displays it in the game world in 3D coordinates. This mesh can be positioned and oriented for in-game-specific purposes. This makes it suitable for displaying the text on the screen at a size that is invariant to the screen resolution.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">GUIButton</code>: The <a id="id251" class="indexterm"></a>Unity Engine offers a script-only API<a id="id252" class="indexterm"></a> for generating user interface buttons. These are suitable for 2D elements that need to be animated in screen space and for the dynamic menu UI in the game. These elements cannot be placed in the editor like the other classes discussed earlier in this list; they are controlled entirely from within C#.</p></li></ul></div></div>
