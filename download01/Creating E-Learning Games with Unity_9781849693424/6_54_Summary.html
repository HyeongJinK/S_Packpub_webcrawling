We extended these bases to build a library of behaviors from which we can construct NPC behaviors. We then developed a decision-manage class that can evaluate these conditions and dispatch responses. This extendible pipeline can be specialized and quickly iterated upon in the Unity3D Editor. In the next chapter, we will put this to good use as we write the second level of our e-learning game. This level will take the knowledge learned from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to E-Learning and the Three Cs of 3D Games</em></span>, and will test the player's recall in a fun and engaging way.</p></div>
