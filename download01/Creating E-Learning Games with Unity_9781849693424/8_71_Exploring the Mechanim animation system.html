To start, let's develop the locomotion system.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Import the downloaded animations to a new folder named <code class="literal">anims</code>, in <code class="literal">Chapter8</code>. If you downloaded the animations attached to a skin, don't worry.

This is the component that drives a character with the Mechanim system. Once you have added this component, you will be able to animate the character with the Mechanim system.</p></li><li><p>Create a new animator controller and call it <code class="literal">JustinController</code>.</p></li><li><p>Drag-and-drop <code class="literal">JustinController</code> into the controller reference on the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component of the <code class="literal">Justin</code> instance. The animator controller is the file that will store the specific Mechanim FSM that the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component will use to drive the character. Think of it as a container for the FSM.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <code class="literal">Justin@t-pose</code> model from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, and drag-and-drop the avatar definition file from <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Avatar</strong></span> reference on the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component on the <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> instance.</p></li><li><p>Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> drop-down menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span>. You will see a new tab open up beside the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. With your <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> model selected, you should see an empty <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> panel inside the tab, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Right now <a id="id424" class="indexterm"></a>our <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> model has no animations in his FSM. Let's add the idle animation (named <code class="literal">Idle_1</code>) from the <span class="strong"><strong>Adam</strong></span> model we downloaded. You can drag-and-drop it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view to any location inside this panel.</p><p>That's all there is to it! Now, we have a single <code class="literal">anim</code> FSM attached to our character. When you play the game now, it should show <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> playing the <code class="literal">Idle</code> animation. You may notice that the loop doesn't repeat or cycle repeatedly. To fix this, you need to duplicate the animation and then select the <span class="strong"><strong>Loop Pose</strong></span> checkbox.</p></li><li><p>Highlight<a id="id425" class="indexterm"></a> the animation child object <code class="literal">idle_1</code> and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> shortcut to duplicate it. The duplicate will appear outside of the hierarchy. You can then rename it to a name of your choice. Let's choose <code class="literal">Idle</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_12.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, click on <code class="literal">Idle</code>, and <a id="id426" class="indexterm"></a>in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>Loop Pose</strong></span> is selected.</p><p>Congratulations! Using this <code class="literal">Idle</code> animation now results in a character who idles in a loop. Let's take a look at adding the walk animation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_13.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Zombie Running</strong></span> animation, which is a child asset of the <span class="strong"><strong>Zombie</strong></span> model, and duplicate it such that a new copy appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window. Rename this copy <code class="literal">Run</code>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <a id="id427" class="indexterm"></a>this animation and make sure to check the <span class="strong"><strong>Loop Pose</strong></span> checkbox so that the animation runs in cycles.</p></li><li><p>Drag-and-drop the <a id="id428" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation into the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> tab. You should now have two animations in your FSM, with the default animation still as <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span>; if you run the game, <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> should still just be idle. To make him switch animations, we need to do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Add some transitions to the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation from the <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> animation and vice versa.</p></li><li><p>Trigger the transitions from a script.</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>You will want to switch from the <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation when the player's speed (as determined from the script) is greater than a small number (let's say 0.1 f). Since the variable for speed only lives in the script, we will need a way for the script to communicate with the animation, and we will do this with parameters.</p></li><li><p>In <a id="id429" class="indexterm"></a>your <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> tab, note that the FSM we are developing lives in the <span class="strong"><strong>Base Layer</strong></span> screen. While it is possible to add multiple animation layers by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign <a id="id430" class="indexterm"></a>under <span class="strong"><strong>Base Layer</strong></span>, this would allow the programmer to design multiple concurrent animation FSMs that could be used to develop varying degrees/levels of complex animation.</p></li><li><p> Add a new parameter by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign beside the <span class="strong"><strong>Parameters</strong></span> panel. Select <span class="strong"><strong>float</strong></span> from the list of datatypes. You should now see a new parameter. Name this <code class="literal">speed</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_14.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> Animation and select <span class="strong"><strong>Make Transition</strong></span>. You will now see that a white arrow is visible, which extends from <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span>, that tracks the position of your mouse pointer. If you now click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation, the transition from <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> will lock into place.</p></li><li><p>Left-click on the little white triangle of the transition and observe the inspector for the transition itself. Scroll down in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window to the very bottom and set the condition for the transition to speed greater than <code class="literal">0.1</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_15.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Make the transition from the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation cycle back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> cycle by following the <a id="id431" class="indexterm"></a>same procedure. Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation to start the transition. Then, left-click on <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span>. After this, left-click on the transition once it is locked into place. Then, when the transition is activated in <span class="strong"><strong>Conditions</strong></span>, set its speed to less than <code class="literal">0.09</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! Our<a id="id432" class="indexterm"></a> character will now transition from <span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> when the speed crosses the <code class="literal">0.1</code> threshold.

In a complicated character system, you may use both of these in different places.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>With the in-place animation, the character hierarchy is animated by the animation, whereas the root note of the character is not.

This means that you (as a programmer) need not translate nor rotate the root node about an axis because your animator will be responsible for doing that. Hence, this is a popular choice for some games but not all.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Since our <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> animation does not have root motion in it, we will move our character around in the script.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec62"></a>Adding the character script</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's build<a id="id435" class="indexterm"></a> the second half of our character system—the script that communicates the speed value to the FSM.
