To add a professional layer of polish, we will learn how to add skinned models and various types of animations to our e-learning game. We will download skinned mesh models and animations from a popular site and learn how to integrate them into the game, as we develop a character motion system. We will also learn about the in-editor animation editor and how it can be used to animate static meshes (appropriate for in-game models such as buildings, cars, and statues that are not weighted to a 3D skeletal hierarchy).</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Exploring 3D hierarchies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Skinned meshes in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Exploring the Mechanim animation system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Exploring the Unity Animation editor</p></li></ul></div></div>
