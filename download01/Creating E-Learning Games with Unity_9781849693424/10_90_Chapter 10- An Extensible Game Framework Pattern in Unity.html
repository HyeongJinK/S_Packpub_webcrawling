To do this, we will need to complete a framework for loading and unloading individual scene files, connect that system into level transition logic, and restructure a number of classes and Prefabs in our scene files so that they work together using this pattern. We will also develop the code necessary to ensure that the references that were created inside the editor can be reconnected as necessary when scenes are streamed in. Having a consistent pattern with which we can organize our scripts based on when they are needed gives us a reusable and extendible pattern we can use to quickly add new levels to our game. Not only this, but it can be used as a framework for future games that you develop!</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Load additively</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using delete/load patterns</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Refactoring our work</p></li></ul></div></div>
