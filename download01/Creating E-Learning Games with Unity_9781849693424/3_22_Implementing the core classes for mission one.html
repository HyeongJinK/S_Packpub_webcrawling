Let's begin by creating the classes and <code class="literal">GameObject</code> instances for this level. To begin, create a new scene file and name it <code class="literal">TESTBED</code>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec20"></a>Creating a terrain</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's create a<a id="id156" class="indexterm"></a> nice<a id="id157" class="indexterm"></a> terrain mesh to replace the ground plane from the previous two levels. With this, we can create a nice-looking mesh for the ground that resembles a park with grass, mountains, and trees by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> menu, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Assets</strong></span>. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button on the pop-up window that appears next to bring a library of models and textures into Unity for use with the terrain editor.</p></li><li><p>To create a terrain mesh, let's navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>CreateOther</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span>, from the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> drop-down list.</p></li><li><p>On<a id="id158" class="indexterm"></a> the <a id="id159" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Set Heightmap resolution</strong></span> pop up that appears, configure the parameters to the following values:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Width</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Length</strong></span>: The horizontal dimensions of the terrain mesh. Set both to <code class="literal">500</code> units.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Height</strong></span>: The maximum height of the terrain (for mountains and so on). Set this to <code class="literal">500</code> units.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The remaining parameters control the resolution of the textures that are painted onto the terrain. Keep these at their defaults.</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_03_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on the new terrain GameObject in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, set its position to <code class="literal">-250, 0, -250</code>. This will place the terrain in the 3D world at a convenient location that results in the middle of the terrain at the world origin, which is convenient for development.</p></li><li><p>Clicking on the new terrain, observe the seven unique radio buttons on the terrain component in the inspector tab as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_03_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>The first one from left-hand side will raise or lower terrain depending on if <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> are held down while clicking and moving the mouse. Zoom out in the scene view; select one of the many interesting brushes; and try creating some mountains. Note the effect that brush size and opacity has on the deformations to the terrain.</p></li><li><p>The <a id="id160" class="indexterm"></a>second<a id="id161" class="indexterm"></a> button allows you to paint to a certain height. This is good for fine control of elevation in a terrain mesh if you want to build very specific configurations of plateaus.</p></li><li><p>The third button is the smooth height button. Use this if you have previously painted some elevations with a brush that has lots of bumps and jagged edges. This brush will average and round out the selected peaks.</p></li><li><p>The fourth button is the paint textures button. If you navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Textures</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>, you can select a texture from any of the imported textures in the project thus far. Click on the texture viewer panel (rather than the normal map panel) to see a dialog box of all available options. After selecting and confirming, you will see your selection as an option back in the terrain previewer. Now, with your favorite brush selected, you can paint the texture onto your terrain. Add a variety of textures to paint grass, roads, and mountain details into your terrain.</p></li><li><p>The next button lets you paint tree models into your scene. Select a tree model from the edit trees button, and once you have confirmed a selection, choose a brush and density to paint the models with. A low-density circle can be used to add foliage to the tops of your mountain ranges. If you find that your game suddenly runs slowly after painting trees, it likely means you have too many tree models on screen. The fix for this is to reduce the density of the trees.</p></li><li><p>The second from the right-hand side button lets you paint the details into your scene. The workflow is similar to painting trees, and they behave similarly as well although this is intended for small details such as grass.</p></li><li><p>The right-most button lets you control the parameters of your terrain component. Things such as wind-speed, draw distances, and grass color let you fine-tune the look of your park.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once you have finished <a id="id162" class="indexterm"></a>making your park, it should look somewhat like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_03_04.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec21"></a>Creating the FlagLocators GameObject</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's <a id="id163" class="indexterm"></a>create the<a id="id164" class="indexterm"></a> hierarchy for <code class="literal">FlagLocators</code> in the scene as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create 10 <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> GameObjects.

Name these <code class="literal">FlagLocator1</code> to <code class="literal">FlagLocator10</code>.</p></li><li><p>Disable all of the mesh renderers to make these objects invisible in the rendered scene. We will leave these components attached for debugging, but we don't want to draw them normally. Should we want to see where these locators are later on, we just need to enable the renderers to show the geometry.</p></li><li><p>Create another empty <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, and name it <code class="literal">FlagLocators</code>. Drag-and-drop all of the locators from step one underneath this object.</p></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! We now have a data collection of potential places for flags to spawn in mission one.

When the player picks up a flag, or presses on the flag button in the inventory, a pop-up card for the relevant state is displayed as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_03_08.jpg" /></div><p>The pop-up card Prefabs<a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a> can be created by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a <a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a>new <code class="literal">GUITexture</code> object, and name it <code class="literal">popup_&lt;statename&gt;</code>.</p></li><li><p>Drag-and-drop an instance of the <code class="literal">TriviaCardScript</code> to the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>.
