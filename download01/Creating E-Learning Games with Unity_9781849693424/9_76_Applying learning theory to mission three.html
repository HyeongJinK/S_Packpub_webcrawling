Hence, one powerful way to design mission content for our e-learning game is to deliver content that requires the player to interact with the subject matter in a variety of ways. Bloom's Taxonomy (aptly named after American educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom) gives us a pyramid heuristic that illustrates this concept. Relevant to this text; this taxonomy is a set of descriptive words that may be used to classify the different levels of cognitive complexity at which learning can occur.</p><p>Having used <span class="emphasis"><em>remembering</em></span> as the underlying instructional mode in mission one (find the flags) and <span class="emphasis"><em>applying</em></span> as the underlying instructional mode in mission two (quiz race), we increase the level of interaction with the subject matter in mission three to <span class="emphasis"><em>analysis</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>evaluation</em></span> of the NPC's statements. We do this in order to encourage the player to synthesize an appropriate, subject-relevant reply. Through working with the same material on multiple levels, the player is naturally encouraged to remember, retain, and consolidate the learning that has taken place.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on Bloom's Taxonomy, feel free to review the information at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bloomstaxonomy.org/Blooms%20Taxonomy%20questions.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.bloomstaxonomy.org/Blooms%20Taxonomy%20questions.pdf</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/bloomtax.htm" target="_blank">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/bloomtax.htm</a>.</p></div></div>
