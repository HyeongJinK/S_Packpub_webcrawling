Instead of each GameObject in the hierarchy have its own mesh, a single set of polygons is shared across a number of transforms. This results in a single mesh that we call a skin because it envelops the transforms in a skin-like structure. It turns out that this type of mesh is great for in-game characters because it moves like skin.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>We will now use <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mixamo.com" target="_blank">www.mixamo.com</a> to download some free models and animations for our game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec58"></a>Acquiring and importing models</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's download a <a id="id412" class="indexterm"></a>character model for the hero of our game.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open your favorite Internet browser and go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mixamo.com" target="_blank">www.mixamo.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span> and scroll through the list of skinned models. From the models that are listed free, choose the one that you want to use. At the time of writing this book, we chose <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> from the free models available, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Justin</strong></span> and you will be presented with a preview window of the character <a id="id413" class="indexterm"></a>on the next page. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> to prepare the model for download. Note, you may have to sign up for an account on the website to continue.</p></li><li><p>Once you have clicked <a id="id414" class="indexterm"></a>on <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span>, the small downloads pop-up window at the bottom-right corner of the screen will contain your model. Open the tab and select the model. Make sure to set the download format to <span class="strong"><strong>FBX for Unity (.fbx)</strong></span> and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> again. <span class="strong"><strong>FBX</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Filmbox</strong></span>)—originally created by a company of the same name and now owned by AutoDesk—is an industry standard format for models and animations. Congratulations! You have downloaded the model we will use for the main player character.</p></li><li><p>While this model will be downloaded and saved to the <code class="literal">Downloads</code> folder of your browser, go back to the character select page and choose two more models to use for other NPCs in the game. At the time of writing this book, we chose <span class="strong"><strong>Alexis</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Zombie</strong></span> from the selection of free models, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Go to Unity, create a folder in your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab named <code class="literal">Chapter8</code>, and inside this folder, create a <a id="id415" class="indexterm"></a>folder named <code class="literal">models</code>. Right-click on this folder and select <span class="strong"><strong>Open In Explorer</strong></span>. Once you have the <a id="id416" class="indexterm"></a>folder opened, drag-and-drop the two character models from your <code class="literal">Download</code> folder into the <code class="literal">models</code> folder. This will trigger the process of importing a model into Unity, and you should then see your models in your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_04.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on each model in the <code class="literal">models</code> folder, and note that the <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> tab shows a t-pose of the model as well as some import options. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> pane, under the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> tab, ensure that <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Type</strong></span> is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Generic</strong></span>. The various rig options tell Unity how to animate the skinned mesh on the model. While <span class="strong"><strong>Generic</strong></span> would work, choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> <a id="id417" class="indexterm"></a>will give us more options when <a id="id418" class="indexterm"></a>animating under Mechanim. Let Unity create the avatar definition file for you and you can simply click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> settings, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We can now drag-and-drop your characters to the game from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view of the level, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_08_06.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded, imported, and instantiated skinned mesh models. Now, let's learn how to animate them, and we will do this starting with the main player's character.</p></div></div>
