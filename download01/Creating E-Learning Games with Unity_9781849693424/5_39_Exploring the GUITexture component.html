You can see the <span class="strong"><strong>GUITexture</strong></span> component as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_05_02.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> field is a reference to a 2D graphic element. This could be a <code class="literal">.png</code>, <code class="literal">.jpg</code>, or <code class="literal">.bmp</code> file that you created in the Paint program on your computer. Each file type has its benefits and drawbacks depending on how much compression you need in your file. Dragging-and-dropping it into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab will import the image, after which you can set the reference.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> field lets the user select a specific tint for the <code class="literal">GUITexture</code>. This is a convenient way to fine-tune the appearance of the texture without having to edit it in your external Paint program.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Inset</strong></span> field works in a way similar to the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Offset</strong></span> field. The <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> fields correspond to the screen space coordinates of the upper-left corner of the texture. The <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> fields provide a way to stretch and scale the graphics vertically and horizontally; combining these two lets the programmer place and resize the visuals precisely.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Left Border</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Right Border</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Top Border</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Bottom Border</strong></span> fields provide a way to tile the texture to the left, right, top, or bottom of the original. These measurements are in pixels as well and not in screen percentages.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"></a>Tip</h3><p>To make sure that the <code class="literal">GUITexture</code> component you create displays behind the <code class="literal">GUIText</code> that you instantiate, you can adjust their relative priorities with the <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> component of the transform position. Larger z components will draw closer to the camera and smaller ones (even negative ones) will draw farther away. Keeping this in mind, we can sort our textures and text elements as required by our design.</p></div></div>
