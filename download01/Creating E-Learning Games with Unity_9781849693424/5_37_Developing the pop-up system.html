The pop-up system will consist of a window that can display text and graphics. An instance of a pop up can have a number of buttons, each of which will interact with the game in an easy-to-program way. We will integrate them into our existing mission one to achieve a higher level of polish, and these will form the new active user interface, which the user will use to communicate with the game, and with which the game will communicate with the user.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">popupMenu</code>: This pop-up Prefab will provide the usability for an in-game menu system.
