The final game is composed of four scene files, each of which contains a single GameObject hierarchy. The top object in the hierarchy is given a name consistent with the scene filename. Some refactoring of existing systems was then required to fix up the classes at initialization time so that no missing or dangling references would be incurred.</p><p>Congratulations! We have now finished our e-learning game framework. Not only did we develop a game that exercises good teaching and learning pedagogy, we also implemented a number of core gameplay systems for the interactive elements in the game. While we proved the technology with a geography trivia game, the framework could be adapted and re-skinned for other topics. Logical potential directions for future work could include adding levels beyond the initial three. This could be done by developing more interactive objects for your game by fleshing out your library of condition-and-response classes for the decision manager, optimizing your code so that it can run efficiently on resource constrained platforms such as smartphones, or adding more polish to the game such as through audio or particles. No matter what, make sure you have fun in the process!</p></div>
