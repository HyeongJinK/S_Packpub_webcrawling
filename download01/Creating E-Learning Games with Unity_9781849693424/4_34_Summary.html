We have created a <code class="literal">GameMgr</code> class to handle the new game states for our game, and we have associated individual level scenes with unique states; a good practice for flexible and extensible programming. We updated the camera, score, and PlayerData systems to add further polish and functionality to our game. Next, we will learn about the various user interface options that Unity provides. We will use these to develop a HUD system for our game that will meet the final needs of our e-learning game.</p></div>
