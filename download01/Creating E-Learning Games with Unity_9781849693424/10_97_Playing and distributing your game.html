Unity is a cross platform engine, and <a id="id536" class="indexterm"></a>while that does mean that you can design once and build a game that runs on many types of hardware, let's build a version that works for Windows (the preferred development hardware for this text).</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open up the <code class="literal">MAIN</code> scene from the completed project.</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> drop-down menu.</p></li><li><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> screen, make sure that the four scene files for our game have been added to the build.
