To use this component, you need to add an instance of this component to an existing game object in your scene, and set the text field to the string you want to display.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>Please keep in mind that the way in which the transform component of the <code class="literal">GUIText</code> GameObject is <a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a>processed for <code class="literal">GUIText</code> is different for other GameObjects with the same component, which we will discuss later.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec42"></a>Interpreting the members on GUIText</h3></div></div></div><p>A (<code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0.0f</code>) position<a id="id256" class="indexterm"></a> corresponds to the center of the screen. For this component to work as designed, the object needs to be placed here in the world. The x and y components of the (x, y, z) vector on the transform range from 0.0f to 1.0f each.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"></a>Tip</h3><p>Do not place <code class="literal">GUIText</code> on a moving object. If the transform moves, the meaning of the text position will change, and the text will likely go some place you don't want it to! If you want to track a moving object with <code class="literal">GUIText</code>, then you need to adjust the x and y values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Inset</strong></span> vector instead of parenting it.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Inset</strong></span> vector is a special 2D vector that specifies where on the screen (relative to the transform's x, y components) the text should be displayed. The units of this are in pixels and not screen percentages. This means that if you resize your window, these numbers may not remain correct. The fix for this is to set your pixel offsets via a script.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span> fields on the <span class="strong"><strong>GUIText</strong></span> component correspond to the location where the position should be tracked on the string itself. With options in the center or at the corners, the API allows the programmer to easily align the text field at the center or the margin.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Font Style</strong></span> fields allow the programmer to specify the size of the text and whether it should be rendered normal, bold, or italic. Use these liberally to give your text some added visual pop and personality.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Font</strong></span> field is where the actual font file reference for this text is established. By importing various fonts into Unity, you can render your 2D text in a variety of typesets.</p></div></div>
