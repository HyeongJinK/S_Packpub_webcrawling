We integrated skinned models and animations from a third party. Using Mechanim, we created visually designed animation FSMs as well as the scripting-side integration. We upgraded our player, racer, and NPC game objects such that they now use these animated characters rather than the placeholder Prefabs.</p><p>We also learned a bit about the legacy animation system and the in-editor animation editor. We gained experience with this by creating a custom hand-tuned animation for a banner's flag pole and applied it to the game object so that it would play automatically. The game is looking much more polished now; a little visual appeal goes a long way!</p><p>In the next chapter, we will develop the final mission of the game, where we present the user with novel situations where they must use higher-order reasoning around the subject matter. This approach of thinking about the material from a bottom-up and top-down approach promotes consolidation of the material and is an effective way to drive learning in the user.</p></div>
