Start the level by running the <code class="literal">MAIN</code> scene. Notice the main menu pop-up window that presents the game and waits for the player to click to begin. Once level one loads, drive the player around the level to find the five missing flags. Once found, press their icon in the inventory to read the information about each state as these information card Prefabs have now been updated with interesting trivia about each region. Once all five are found, the system will tell you to return them to the monument, at which time the flags will return, and the mission will be done. Note the score updating when each mission is updated and the smooth character motion across the terrain.</p></div>
