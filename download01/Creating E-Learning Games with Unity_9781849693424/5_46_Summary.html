After some analysis, we determined the best scenarios to use each one of them. Finally, we applied our knowledge and built a pop-up system using programming techniques from previous chapters to build a generic, interactive, and responsive menu system. We built a couple of Prefabs and redesigned the frontend of the game using this new system to prove the efficiency of the technology. This adds a level of polish to our game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue to add polish and interactivity as we program non-player characters for our game. By populating the game world with other characters and objects, it will add more depth to the game world that makes the experience more engaging, which will promote further learning by the user.</p></div>
