To illustrate the concept of e-learning in games, our game will teach players American state flags and trivia over the course of three levels. After beginning with a definition of e-learning games and how they relate to "traditional" video games, we will carry on with implementing the core systems that control the main character of the game and define its abilities and ways to control the camera that follows the player in our 3D world.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understanding e-learning</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Introducing our game—Geography Quest</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Comprehending the three Cs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating our first scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Developing the character system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building character representation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Developing code for the camera</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Developing code for the player controls</p></li></ul></div></div>
