We developed base systems for the character, controls, and camera that have parameters so that designers and programmers can adjust the look and feel of the game quickly and easily.</p><p>Going forward, we will build the code necessary to make our game interactive! We will learn how to program interactive objects in our game, and we will develop the technology for a mission system, which will allow the game designer to build missions and objectives, track their status, and give them to the user in a systemic way.</p></div>
