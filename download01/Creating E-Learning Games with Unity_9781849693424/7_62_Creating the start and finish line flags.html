<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec62"></a>Creating the start and finish line flags</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>To mark the starting and ending location of the race, we will create a giant flag Prefab and instance it in<a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a> both places. The banner <a id="id357" class="indexterm"></a>of the flag will have cloth physics to give it an interesting motion. If you are targeting a lightweight device such as a phone, feel free to simply replace the cloth object with a flat plane if performance is an issue in your application. In order to create the start and finish line flags, we need to perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create two cylindrical game objects.<a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a> Set them three units apart from<a id="id359" class="indexterm"></a> one another, and scale them up to a <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>6</strong></span>. Name these as <span class="strong"><strong>pole1</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>pole2</strong></span>. In the scene view, you should see something like the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_07_04.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Create a cloth GameObject. It will appear as a flat plane in its initial position in the <a id="id360" class="indexterm"></a>editor, <a id="id361" class="indexterm"></a>but when you play the game, the cloth simulation will apply the motion.</p></li><li><p>Scale and <a id="id362" class="indexterm"></a>rotate <a id="id363" class="indexterm"></a>the cloth object so that it faces the ground at right angles. Scale the object so that it penetrates both poles. This will allow us to attach the cloth to the poles so that the physics simulation results in a draping banner.</p></li><li><p>Create an empty GameObject, and place it at ground level between the two poles. Name it <span class="strong"><strong>GiantFlag</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select the cloth object, and make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Use Gravity</strong></span> checkbox is selected.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_07_05.png.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>AttachedColliders</strong></span> member of the cloth object. Set the size to <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span>. Drag-and-drop the first pole into the first collider reference and the second pole into the second collider reference. This will bind the banner to both poles.</p></li><li><p>Create a<a id="id364" class="indexterm"></a> material <a id="id365" class="indexterm"></a>with a nice checkerboard material, and attach it to the cloth component.</p></li><li><p>Drag-and-drop<a id="id366" class="indexterm"></a> this object to the project tab, and name the Prefab GiantFlag.</p></li><li><p>Create two instances <a id="id367" class="indexterm"></a>of this <span class="strong"><strong>GiantFlag</strong></span> Prefabâ€”one at the starting line and one at the finish line of the path. Your flag should look something like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693424/graphics/3424OS_07_06.png.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations, you have created two banners for the game to mark the start and finish lines of the race! Click on the cloth simulation component of the <span class="strong"><strong>GiantFlag</strong></span> Prefab, and experiment with the external acceleration, random acceleration, and friction variables to achieve different levels of motion in the banners themselves.</p></div>
