Some of the game objects are listed as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">MissionMgr</code>: This<a id="id454" class="indexterm"></a> GameObject will be present in this level, but we will not use a new mission to track the level progress. The <code class="literal">missionMgr</code> GameObject<a id="id455" class="indexterm"></a> should still stick around in case we want to add secondary missions or side-quests to the game in the future.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Player</code>: The <a id="id456" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Player</code> GameObject <a id="id457" class="indexterm"></a>will need to have a working <code class="literal">playerData</code> component script attached to it. Since this level is completed upon achieving a certain score, and since scores (along with other statistics) are tracked in this data structure, we are required to implement <code class="literal">playerData</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">LevelLogicObj</code> : The <a id="id458" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">LevelLogicObj</code> GameObject<a id="id459" class="indexterm"></a> is the main logic object that will track the players' score and the number of points that have been earned in this level, and will dispatch the pass condition pop up at the end of the level, assuming enough points have been acquired.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">QuizCard</code> : The <a id="id460" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">QuizCard</code> GameObject<a id="id461" class="indexterm"></a> creates a number of quiz cards (one for each state) that show the user a unique question or hint that the NPC will present to the player. The NPC will ask the player to choose a state that addresses their statement. If the correct answer is given, 500 points will be awarded to the player.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code>: The <a id="id462" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">CorrectResponse</code> GameObject <a id="id463" class="indexterm"></a>creates a number of response cards that show your response (as the player) to the NPC when you give a correct response. These form the second half of the player to NPC interaction system in this level.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">SetupLevel3</code>: The <a id="id464" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">SetupLevel3</code> GameObject<a id="id465" class="indexterm"></a> is the Prefab that does the setup for <code class="literal">Mission 3</code> and starts the level.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Time</code> : The <a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Time</code> GameObject <a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a>is a <code class="literal">clock</code> object. In this mission the pressure element will be provided by the race against the clock. If the clock reaches zero before 2,500 points are acquired, this class activates the failure condition pop-up dialog window.</p></li></ul></div></div>
