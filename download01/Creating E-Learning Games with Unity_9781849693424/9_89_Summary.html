We developed the third mission of the three in our game, and by applying Bloom's Taxonomy to our learning outcomes, we developed content that encouraged the user to interact with the content at a high level, thus encouraging learning. This completes the final stage in our e-learning game. In the final chapter, we will tie these three levels together with the rest of the game framework while refactoring some systems during the process.</p></div>
