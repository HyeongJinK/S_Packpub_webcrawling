The variables that I have shown you so far are called member variables. They are members of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> classâ€”not declared within any method. These member variables are the only variables that have the option of being displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel or being accessed by other scripts.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>Declaring your member variables at the beginning of a class may give you a mental clue that these member variables can be used anywhere in the script.</p></div><p>We will also be<a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a> creating variables in methods. These variables are called local variables. They are never displayed in the Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, nor can they be accessed by other scripts. This brings us to another concept of programming, called variable scope.</p></div>
