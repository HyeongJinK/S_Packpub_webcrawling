One very important stage in the planning of your project is to decide what platforms you would like to support at the beginning. This is simply to know whether you can have any platform-dependent constraints. For example, if you decide to make your game available on mobile phones and tablets, you need to remember that you cannot use right-clicks of a mouse at all in your game, as you are restricted to using the touchscreen interface. There are many platforms to choose from.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_08_8.jpg" /></div><p>In this book, we <a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a>will, of course, go for the easiest option available and <a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a>choose the <span class="strong"><strong>PC</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span> platforms.</p></div>
