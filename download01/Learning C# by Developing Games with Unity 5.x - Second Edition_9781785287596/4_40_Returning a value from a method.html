<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec43"></a>Returning a value from a method</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now it's time <a id="id143" class="indexterm"></a>to discover the <span class="emphasis"><em>power</em></span> feature of using a<a id="id144" class="indexterm"></a> method. This usually means sending data to the method, which you just learned to do. Then we have the method return a value. Previously, we used a <code class="literal">void</code> type method. I have mentioned before that this is a keyword for <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span>, which means that the function isn't returning anything.</p><p>Let's learn about <code class="literal">return</code> type functions now. We won't use <code class="literal">void</code> anymore. Instead of that, we will write the type of data that we want our method to return. Don't worry if this sounds complicated; it isn't. I remember that, years ago, I had some issues getting my head around it. In practice, this is a very simple concept.</p><p>Let's take a look at the following example. I have highlighted two key areas that we will speak about next.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_04_04.jpg" /></div><p>As you<a id="id145" class="indexterm"></a> can see, this method is very similar to the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method that we spoke of previously. The two main differences<a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a> are highlighted.</p><p>A <code class="literal">return</code> type function will always begin with a description of the type of data that it's returning. In this case, we will be returning the sum of two numbers, so our type is <code class="literal">int</code> (an integer). In simple words, the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> function is returning a number.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec41"></a>Returning the value</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you<a id="id147" class="indexterm"></a> have decided what type of data will be returned by a method, you must tell the function what value will be returned. The syntax is very straightforward. We use the <code class="literal">return</code> keyword, as highlighted in blue, followed by the value we are returning.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec05"></a>Example</h4></div></div></div><p>You <a id="id148" class="indexterm"></a>just learned how to write a <code class="literal">return</code> type method. Time to put it to use! Let's write a new script and call it <code class="literal">LearningReusableMethodsWithReturn</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_04_05.jpg" /></div><p>What do<a id="id149" class="indexterm"></a> we have here? You probably understand most of this code with no issues, but it's good practice to go through it line by line. Lines <span class="strong"><strong>7</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>8</strong></span> contain declarations of the <code class="literal">number1</code> and <code class="literal">number2</code> integer variables. Lines <span class="strong"><strong>22</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>27</strong></span> are exactly the same as we used in the last example. They have the declaration of a method that takes two parameters—<code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code>—and it returns a value of the <code class="literal">int</code> type.</p><p>Lines <span class="strong"><strong>30</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>34</strong></span> contain the declaration of method that simply prints the given <code class="literal">int</code> value on the Unity console. Now is the most important part you need to remember. Take a look at line <span class="strong"><strong>14</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">int sumResult = AddTwoNumbers(number1, number2); </pre></div><p>The left-hand side of this line is a simple declaration of an <code class="literal">int</code> variable called <code class="literal">sumResult</code>. Simple! What I want to talk about is the right-hand side—the assignment of this variable. As you can see, what we are doing here is calling the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> method instead of simply giving the value to be stored in <code class="literal">sumResult</code>. It might look a bit awkward. You would expect a value to be passed instead of another method call.</p><p>Let me<a id="id150" class="indexterm"></a> explain how it works. The <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers</code> method is a <code class="literal">return</code> type method. It does return an <code class="literal">int</code> value in every place where you call it—instantly. In even simpler words, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is an integer, and a number value.</p><p>This concept might be a bit difficult to get your head around. If you still don't get it, don't worry. All you need to remember right now is the fact that, whenever a program calls a method that returns something, it is calling the method and inserting the value that the method returns into the place where it made the call.</p><p>Remember I told you that, when you call a method, it's just a substitute for the code block that will be executed. It's like taking all of the code in the method's code block and placing it right where the method was called.</p></div></div></div>
