We also know how to declare a new list and add, remove, and retrieve<a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a> elements. Moreover, you have learned that the data stored in List&lt;T&gt; must be of the same type across all elements. Let's throw a little curveball.</p><p>
<code class="literal">ArrayList</code> is basically List&lt;T&gt; without a specified type of data. This means that we can store whatever objects we want. Storing elements of different types is also possible. <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> is very flexible. Take a look at the following example to understand what <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> can look like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_05_04.jpg" /></div><p>You have probably noticed that <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> also supports all common operations, such as <code class="literal">.Add()</code>. Lines <span class="strong"><strong>12</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span> add different elements into the array. The first two are of the <code class="literal">integer</code> type, the third is a <code class="literal">string</code> type, and the last one is a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. All mixed types of elements in one variable!</p><p>When using <a id="id183" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">ArrayList</code>, you might need to check what type of element is under a specific index to know how to treat it in code. Unity provides a very useful function that you can use on virtually any type of object. Its <code class="literal">GetType()</code> method returns the type of the object, not the value. We are using it in lines <span class="strong"><strong>18</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>19</strong></span> to print the types of the second and third elements.</p><p>Go ahead, write the preceding code, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>. You should get the following output in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_05_05.jpg" /></div></div>
