To do this, we use the <code class="literal">break</code> keyword. Whenever Unity executes a line containing the <code class="literal">break</code> keyword, it will stop the loop<a id="id222" class="indexterm"></a> it is in and continue executing from the line just after the loop block.</p><p>We use <code class="literal">break</code> mainly for performance reasons. In the preceding example, we are looking for the <code class="literal">"Adam"</code> string. Once we've found it, there is no reason to iterate through the remaining elements of the loop. So, line <span class="strong"><strong>24</strong></span> breaks the loop and the execution jumps to just after the loop blockâ€”line <span class="strong"><strong>27</strong></span>.</p></div>
