Actually, you do know what it means. The coffee cup you may have in your hand is an object, a real one. That UFO flying around at night is an object, even if you can't identify it. In Unity, you may have a flying saucer in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, but it's obviously not a real flying saucerâ€”it's a virtual one.</p><p>However, in the virtual world of gaming, most people would consider things they can see on the screen as objects.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_07_1.jpg" /></div><p>If you can expand your mind just a little bit more, perhaps you can accept that not all objects in Unity have to be <a id="id224" class="indexterm"></a>something you can see in a game <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. In fact, the vast majority of objects in Unity are not visually in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>.</p><p>In a computer, an object is just a small section of your computer's memory that acts like a container. The container can have some data stored in variables and some methods to work with the data.</p><p>The best example I can show you is the object you've been using since we started this book:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_07_2.jpg" /></div><p>In MonoDevelop, we've been working with the Script called <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. In Unity, we use the general term Script, but it's actually a class, which means it's a definition of a type of container. Look at line <code class="literal">4</code> of the file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class LearningScript : MonoBehaviour</pre></div><p>See that second word? It means that <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> is a class. In this class, we defined its member variables and <a id="id225" class="indexterm"></a>methods. Any variable not declared in a method is a member variable of the class.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, I told you about the magic that happens when we attach the <code class="literal">script</code> class to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. The Script becomes a Component.</p><p>Besides the visual mesh in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, can you visualize in your mind that a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is just a bunch of different types of Component objects assembled together to construct that <code class="literal">GameObject</code>? Each of those individual Components shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window will become an object in our computer's memory when we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button.</p><p>Select any <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> window and look at <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. For example, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> GameObject. There are several Components on the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> GameObject. Look at each of these defined Components. Every one of these Components started off as a <code class="literal">class</code> file in <a id="id226" class="indexterm"></a>Unity, defining a type of container of variables and methods.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_07_3.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec48"></a>Few facts</h3></div></div></div><p>We don't see or modify those Unity <code class="literal">class</code> files, but they're in Unity somewhere.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The name of the class is also known as the object type of the object that will be created in memory from that class, when the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button is clicked.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Just like <code class="literal">int</code> or a string is a type of data, the name of a class is also a type of data.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>When we declare a variable and specify the type of data it will store, it can easily just store a reference to an object of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> type, as shown in the following line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  LearningScript myVariable;</pre></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Storing a reference to an object in a variable does not mean we are storing the actual object. It means we are storing the location in memory of that object. It's just a reference that points to the object in memory so that the computer knows where to access the object's data and methods. This means we can have several variables storing a reference to the same object, but there's still only one <a id="id227" class="indexterm"></a>actual object in memory.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>A Script is just a file on your hard drive, and there's only ever one file. The <code class="literal">class</code> file simply defines a type of container of variables and methods that will become a Component object in the memory when you click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>. You can attach the Script to many <code class="literal">GameObjects</code>, but there's still only one file on your hard drive.</p></div><p>Attaching a Script to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is like placing a sticky-note on the <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. When we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button, Unity looks at our <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, sees the sticky-note which says, "This <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is supposed to have a Component of type <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. Make some room in the computer's memory to hold this object of variables and methods, as described in the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class file."</p><p>If we were to attach <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> to 1,000 <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>, there will be 1,000 separate sections created in your computer's memory, with each storing an object of type <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. Each one has its own set of variables and methods, as described by the <code class="literal">script</code> file. Each one of those 1,000 sections of computer memory is a separate Component object of its respective <code class="literal">GameObject</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"></a>Note</h3><p>Even though the object created from a class is called a <code class="literal">Component</code> by Unity, in general C# terms each object that gets created from a class is called an instance object.</p></div><p>Your brain is probably just <a id="id228" class="indexterm"></a>about to start boiling. To make this easier to understand, let's write a quick example.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec49"></a>Example</h3></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_07_4.jpg" /></div><p>Take a look at the code. We <a id="id229" class="indexterm"></a>wrote a class named <code class="literal">Person</code>. Notice that I removed : <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> after the name of the class. The main reason is that we treat the class <code class="literal">Person</code> as a simple container of the data, a C# object of type <code class="literal">Person</code>, not a Unity Component. We don't need this class to be a full-spec Unity Component.</p><p>As you can see, you can easily store any type of data inside your class. We make variables public as we will need to access this data from other classes.</p></div></div>
