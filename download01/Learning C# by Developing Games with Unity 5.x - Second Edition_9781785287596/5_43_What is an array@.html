<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec45"></a>What is an array?</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>An array stores <a id="id151" class="indexterm"></a>a sequential collection of values of the same type, in the simplest terms. We can use arrays to store lists of values in a single variable. Imagine we want to store a number of student names. Simple! Just create a few variables and name them <code class="literal">student1</code> , <code class="literal">student2</code>, and so on:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public string student1 = "Greg";
public string student2 = "Kate";
public string student3 = "Adam";
public string student4 = "Mia";</pre></div><p>There's nothing wrong with this. We can print and assign new values to them. The problem starts when you don't know how many student names you will be storing. The name variable suggests that it's a changing element. There is a much cleaner way of storing lists of data.</p><p>Let's store the same names using a C# array variable type:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public string[ ] familyMembers = new string[ ]{"Greg", "Kate", "Adam", "Mia"} ;</pre></div><p>As you can see, all the <a id="id152" class="indexterm"></a>preceding values are stored in a single variable called <code class="literal">familyMembers</code>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec42"></a>Declaring an array</h3></div></div></div><p>To declare a C# array, you must first say what type of data will be stored in the array. As you can see in the preceding example, we are storing strings of characters. After the type, we have an open square bracket and then immediately a closed square bracket <code class="literal">[ ]</code>. This will make the variable an actual array. We also need to declare the size of the array. It simply means how many places are there in our variable to be accessed. The minimum code required to declare a variable looks similar to this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public string[] myArrayName = new string[4];</pre></div><p>The array size is set<a id="id153" class="indexterm"></a> during assignment. As you have learned before, all code after the variable declaration and the equal to sign is an assignment. To assign empty values to all places in the array, simply write the <code class="literal">new</code> keyword followed by the type, an open square bracket, a number describing the size of the array, and then a closed square bracket. If you feel confused, give yourself a bit more time. Then you will fully understand why arrays are helpful. Take a look at the following examples of arrays; don't worry about testing how they work yet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">string[ ] familyMembers = new string[]{"John", "Amanda", "Chris", "Amber"} ;

string[ ] carsInTheGarage = new string[] {"VWPassat", "BMW"} ;

int[ ] doorNumbersOnMyStreet = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 };

GameObject[ ] carsInTheScene = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("car");</pre></div><p>As you can see, we can store different types of data as long as the elements in the array are of the same type. You are probably wondering, what is the last example which looks different:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">GameObject[ ] carsInTheScene = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("car");</pre></div><p>In fact, we are just declaring the new array variable to store a collection of <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> in the scene using the <code class="literal">"car"</code> tag. Jump into the Unity scripting documentation and search for <code class="literal">GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, <code class="literal">GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> is a special built-in Unity function that takes a<a id="id154" class="indexterm"></a> string parameter (<code class="literal">tag</code>) and returns an array of <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> using this tag.</p></div></div>
