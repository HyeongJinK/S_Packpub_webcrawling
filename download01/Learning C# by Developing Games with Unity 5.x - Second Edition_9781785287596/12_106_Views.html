Remember that planning is very important. From now on, we will be using the term <span class="emphasis"><em>view</em></span> a <a id="id381" class="indexterm"></a>lot. In simple words, a view is a portion of the application UI that is visible to the user at a particular time:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Our simple game will contain three simple views: the <span class="strong"><strong>Menu</strong></span> view, the <span class="strong"><strong>InGame</strong></span> view, and the <span class="strong"><strong>GameOver</strong></span> view</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Each view will contain all UI elements, such as buttons, labels, and so on</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Only one view can be displayed to the user at a time</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec69"></a>Constructing the view UI – how to keep things clean</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity draws <a id="id382" class="indexterm"></a>UI elements in a way similar to its rendering of 3D meshes. What I mean by this is that all rendering happens in the 3D space. To draw UI elements, Unity requires a game object with the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component on it. All this new information might be a bit confusing to you, so it's best if we create a view as an example. We will start with the Menu view.</p><p>In our Menu view, we will have only a <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button. The Menu view is the first view that the user will see after they launch our game. Follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new game object and call it <code class="literal">UI</code>. It will be a root of our UI, which means that all views and UI elements will be children of this view. This will help keep the UI and the actual game separate.</p></li><li><p>Create a new child game object and call it <code class="literal">MenuCanvas</code>.</p></li><li><p>Add a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component to the <code class="literal">MenuCanvas</code> game object with the following settings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_12_02.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component represents the abstract space in which the UI is laid out and rendered. All UI elements must be children of a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> that has a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component attached.</p><p>The reason <a id="id383" class="indexterm"></a>we chose the <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Render Mode</strong></span> is that it does not require any additional camera. As we are trying to keep our first Unity game as simple as possible, this is an obvious choice.</p></li><li><p>Add the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> component to the <code class="literal">MenuCanvas</code> game object with these settings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_12_03.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> component is used to control the overall scale and pixel density of UI elements in the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. This scaling affects everything on the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>, including font sizes and image borders.</p><p>Yet again, to keep things simple, we will pick the easiest scaling mode—<span class="strong"><strong>Scale With Screen Size</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec70"></a>Target screen resolution</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating a <a id="id384" class="indexterm"></a>UI for your game, you need to decide what screen resolutions and aspect ratio you want to support. Most modern games support multiple screen resolutions in order to support a variety of games, monitors, and touchscreen devices.</p><p>We are focusing mainly on coding in this book. Creating dynamic UI layouts to fit a number of screen resolutions is possibly a subject for another book. In this case, we will stick to the easiest solution and choose the static canvas resolution as 960 pixels by 600 pixels.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec71"></a>Recognizing events</h3></div></div></div><p>All interactions <a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a>with the user interface occur through the Event System. Actions such as button clicks, drag-and-drop UI elements, and swipe gestures require the Event System to be present in the Unity scene all the time.</p><p>The Event System is a way of sending events to objects in the application based on the input, whether a keyboard, mouse, touch, or custom input.</p><p>To add the Event system to our game, we simply navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Event System</strong></span>, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_12_04.jpg" /></div><p>When you add an <span class="strong"><strong>Event System</strong></span> component to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, you will notice that it does not have much functionality exposed. This is because the <span class="strong"><strong>Event System</strong></span> itself is designed as a manager and facilitator of communication between <span class="strong"><strong>Event System</strong></span> modules.</p><p>We are missing one <a id="id386" class="indexterm"></a>more component in the view. Add the <span class="strong"><strong>Graphic Raycaster</strong></span> component to the Menu Canvas game object. The Raycaster looks at all graphics on the canvas and determines whether any of them have been hit.</p><p>Great! Our Menu Canvas contains all the elements necessary to render and allow user interaction with UI elements.</p><p>Our <code class="literal">MenuCanvas</code> game object should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_12_05.jpg" /></div></div></div>
