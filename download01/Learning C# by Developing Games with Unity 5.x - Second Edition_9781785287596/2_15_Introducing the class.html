Most of your code will be written inside classes. Think about it like a container for variables and methods.</p><p>You just learned about variables and methods. These two items are the building blocks used in Unity scripts. The term "script" is used everywhere in discussions and documents. Look for it in the dictionary, and you will see that it can generally be described as written text. Sure enough, that's what we have. However, since we aren't just writing a screenplay or passing a note to someone, we need to learn the actual terms used in programming.</p><p>Unity calls the code it creates a C# script. However, people like me have to teach you some basic programming skills and tell you that a script is really a class.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>In the previous section about methods, we created a class (script) called <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. It contained a couple of variables and a method. The main concept, or idea, of a class is that it's a container of data, stored in variables, and methods that process that data in some fashion. Because I don't have to constantly write class (script), I will be using the word "script" most of the time. However, I will also be using "class" when getting more specific with C#. Just remember that a script is a class that is attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>.</p></div><p>A script is<a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a> like a blueprint or a written description. In other words, it's just a single file in a folder on our hard drive. We can see it right there in the <span class="strong"><strong>Projects</strong></span> panel. It can't do anything by just sitting there. When we tell Unity to attach it to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, we aren't creating another copy of the file. All we're doing is telling Unity that we want the behaviors described in our script to be a component of the <code class="literal">GameObject</code>.</p><p>When we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button, Unity loads the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> into the computer's memory. Since the script is attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, Unity also has to make a place in the computer's memory to store a component as part of the <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. The component has the capabilities specified in the script (blueprint) that we created.</p><p>It is worth knowing that not every class is a Unity component. In object-oriented programming, we use classes to organize the project. The last thing I want to do is get you confused at this stage, so it's a good idea here to write some code examples. Don't worry about writing it in your <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>. Just look at the examples and try to understand what classes might be used for.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Example 1 – Student</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Person : MonoBehaviour {

  public string firstName = "Greg";
  public string lastName = "Lukosek";
  public string emailAddress = "lukos86@gmail.com";
  public int age = 28;
  public float heightInMeters = 1.75f;

}</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Example 2 – Car</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Car : MonoBehaviour {

  public string make = "Tesla"
  public string model = "S";
  public int numberOfWheels = 4;
  public int topSpeed = 250;

For beginners to Unity, studying C# inheritance isn't a subject you need to learn in any great detail, but you do need to know that each Unity script uses inheritance. We see the code in every script that will be attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. In <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>, the code is on line <span class="strong"><strong>4</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class LearningScript : MonoBehaviour</pre></div><p>The colon and the last word of this code mean that the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class is inheriting behaviors from the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class. This simply means that the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class is making a few of its variables and methods available to the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class. It's no coincidence that the variables and methods inherited look like some of the code that we saw in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>.</p><p>The following are the two inherited behaviors in the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Line 10: void Start ()
Line 15: void Update ()</pre></div><p>You don't have to call these methods; Unity calls <span class="emphasis"><em>them behind the scenes</em></span>. So, the code that you place in these methods gets executed automatically.</p></div></div>
