Depending on who you talk to, some will say "We have to declare a method," others will say "We have to define a method," or even "We have to implement a method." Which is correct? In C#, it doesn't make any difference. Use whichever term helps you learn more easily. I like to say I'm defining a method's code block, nothing <a id="id133" class="indexterm"></a>like declaring a simple variable on a one-line statement.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec39"></a>The minimum requirements for defining a method</h3></div></div></div><p>There<a id="id134" class="indexterm"></a> are three minimum requirements for defining a method:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The type of information, or data, that a method will return to the place from where it was called</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The name of the method should be followed by a pair of parentheses</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A pair of curly braces should be present to contain the code block:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">returnDataType  NameOfTheMethod ( )
{

}</pre></div></li></ul></div><p>Looking at <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> once again, or any Unity-generated script, you can see that the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method has the three minimum requirements for a method:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void Start ()
{

}</pre></div><p>Here's what we have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Our first requirement is the type of data that the method will return to the place in the code that called this method. This method isn't returning any value, so instead of specifying an actual type of data, the <code class="literal">void</code> keyword is used. This informs Unity that nothing is being returned from the method.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The second requirement is the method name, which is <code class="literal">Start()</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The last requirement is the curly braces. They contain the code that defines what the method is going to do.</p></li></ul></div><p>This example fulfills the bare minimum requirements for a method. However, as you can see, there's no code in the code block, so when <code class="literal">Start()</code> is called by Unity, it doesn't do anything at all. Yet it's a method. Normally, if we aren't going to use a method by adding code to a skeleton method created by Unity, we can simply remove them from our script. It's normally best to remove unused code after the script has been written.</p><p>Here's what we know about this bare-minimum method definition as far as Unity is concerned:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There's no public modifier, which means that this method is private by default. Therefore, this method cannot be called from other scripts.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There's no code in the code block. Therefore, this method doesn't do anything. So, it <a id="id135" class="indexterm"></a>can be removed if we wish to remove it.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>Methods that do not return any data use the <code class="literal">void</code> keyword instead of <code class="literal">datatype</code>.</p></div></div></div>
