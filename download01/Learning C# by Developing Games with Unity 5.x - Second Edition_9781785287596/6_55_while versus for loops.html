I bet you are wondering why we should even bother learning them both. A <code class="literal">for</code> loop is great for iterations through arrays and lists. A <code class="literal">while</code> loop is great<a id="id208" class="indexterm"></a> for holding code execution until a condition isn't met.</p><p>I don't want you to <a id="id209" class="indexterm"></a>worry about <code class="literal">while</code> loops for now. We will go through more complex examples when you learn about coroutines in Unity. A coroutine is a special type of method in Unity that can run through an infinite loop without crashing. Let's forget it for a few chapters. We will definitely use them in the second half of the book, when you will be building your first game!</p></div>
