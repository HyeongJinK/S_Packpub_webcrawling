It has pretty much the simplest form of any loop. The <code class="literal">while</code> loop does not create any variable to control its execution. To create a<a id="id206" class="indexterm"></a> <code class="literal">while</code> loop, start with the keyword <code class="literal">while</code>, followed by brackets. Within the brackets, you must write a condition. Whenever the condition is true, the code inside the loop block will be executed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_06_06.jpg" /></div><p>It's worth knowing that this is quite a dangerous loop and you need to know how to use it. As a <code class="literal">while</code> loop does not create any control variable and is not iterating through the list there is a possible scenario where a condition is always true. This will create an infinite loop—a loop that will go on forever. An infinite loop never finishes executing the loop block, and most certainly, it will crash your program and even Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span>.</p><p>To avoid this nasty situation—when Unity crashes and we don't even know why—we can use a variable to control the flow of the <code class="literal">while</code> loop, like we did in our <code class="literal">for</code> loop. Then, this is what the loop looks like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_06_07.jpg" /></div><p>You have seen this before, right? This example contains exactly the same fundamental elements as a <code class="literal">for</code> loop. Line <span class="strong"><strong>20</strong></span> is a initializer, and within line <span class="strong"><strong>22</strong></span>, we have the <code class="literal">i&lt;10</code> condition. The iterator is on line <span class="strong"><strong>26</strong></span>.</p><p>Go ahead and type in the code. Try to predict what will happen in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> Window before you press<a id="id207" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span>.</p></div>
