<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"></a>The Start(), Update(), and Awake() methods and the execution order</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The <code class="literal">Start()</code>, <code class="literal">Update()</code>, and <code class="literal">Awake()</code> methods are called automatically. The <code class="literal">Start()</code> method is <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>called <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>on the frame <a id="id71" class="indexterm"></a>when the script is enabled. For most of our components, this will be when you press the <span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span> button in Unity.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method is called just before the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method. That gives a very convenient place to set up code if you have any. The <code class="literal">Update()</code> method is very specific. It's called on every frame if the component is enabled. It's very useful for observing user keyboard actions, for example. As you can see in our script, in Line <span class="strong"><strong>16</strong></span>, we are checking on every frame to know whether the user has pressed the <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key.</p><p>Let's<a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a> create <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>a new C# Script and <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>call it <code class="literal">LearningMethods</code>. As you can see, the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> methods are added automatically when you create a new script. To test them all, all that we need to do is add the <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method and a few other useful lines to print something on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>As you already know, our three methods should be called in a very specific order. Add the <code class="literal">LearningMethods</code> component to some <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the Unity scene and press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>. Then stop after 2 seconds. Keep an eye on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_02_08.jpg" /></div><p>Wow! A<a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a> lot of stuff on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab? Why? Scroll up to the <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>very <a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a>top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> list. We can observe that Unity has printed the <span class="strong"><strong>Debug:Log</strong></span> information from our <code class="literal">Awake()</code> method, followed by the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method. Then the madness starts. Unity prints tons of messages from the <code class="literal">Update()</code> method. We know why! <code class="literal">Update()</code> is called on every frame, so Unity will execute the lines of code within <code class="literal">Update()</code> forever, for every frame it renders.</p><p>You can, of course, print other information to <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>â€”not just messages. Replace line <span class="strong"><strong>18</strong></span> with this line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Debug.Log(Time.time);</pre></div><p>Press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in Unity. You will notice that the time, in seconds, is printed, after you have pressed <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button. It's fun, isn't it? Maybe not. Don't worry; we will get into much more <a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a>interesting programming <a id="id79" class="indexterm"></a>after<a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a> we cover dot syntax.</p></div>
