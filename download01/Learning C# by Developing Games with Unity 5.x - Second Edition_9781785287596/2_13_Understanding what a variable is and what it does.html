<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"></a>Understanding what a variable is and what it does</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>What is a <a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a>variable? Technically, it's a tiny section of your computer's memory that will hold any information that you put there. While a game is running, it keeps track of where the information is stored, the value kept there, and the type of that value. However, for this chapter, all you need to know is how a variable works. It's very simple.</p><p>What's usually in a mailbox, besides air? Well, usually there's nothing, but occasionally there is something in it. Sometimes, there are letters, bills, a spider, and so on. The point is that what is in a mailbox can vary. Therefore, let's call each mailbox a variable.</p><p>In the game<a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a> development world, some simple examples of variables might be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">playerName</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">playerScore</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">highestScore</code>
</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec18"></a>Naming a variable</h3></div></div></div><p>Using the <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>example of the mailbox, if I asked you to see what is in the mailbox, the first thing you'd ask is, "Which one?" If I say in the Smith mailbox, the brown mailbox, or the round mailbox, you'll know exactly which mailbox to open to retrieve what is inside it. Similarly, in scripts, you have to give your variables a unique name. Then I can ask you what's in the variable named <code class="literal">myNumber</code>, or whatever cool name you might use.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The golden rule</strong></span>
</p><p>When <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>you name variables, try to come up with the best name that accurately describes what value your variable contains. Avoid generic names such as <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">speed</code>, and <code class="literal">score</code>. Instead, name them <code class="literal">playerName</code>, <code class="literal">carSpeed</code>, and <code class="literal">opponentScore</code>, respectively.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"></a>A variable name is just a substitute for a value</h3></div></div></div><p>As <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>you write a script and create a variable, you are simply creating a placeholder or a substitute for the actual information that you want to use. Look at the following simple math equation: <span class="emphasis"><em>2 + 9 = 11</em></span>.</p><p>Simple enough! Now try the following equation: <span class="emphasis"><em>11 + myNumber = ???</em></span>. There is no answer to this. You can't add a number and a word. Going back to the mailbox analogy, write the number <code class="literal">9</code> on a piece of paper. Put it in the mailbox named <code class="literal">myNumber</code>. Now you can solve the equation. What's the value in <code class="literal">myNumber</code>? The value is <code class="literal">9</code>. So now the equation looks normal: <span class="emphasis"><em>11 + 9 = 20</em></span>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">myNumber</code> variable is nothing more than a named placeholder that can store some data (information). So, wherever you would like the number <code class="literal">9</code> to appear in your script, just write <code class="literal">myNumber</code>, and the number <code class="literal">9</code> will be substituted.</p><p>Although this example might seem silly at first, variables can store all kinds of data that is much more complex than a simple number. This is just a simple example that shows you how <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>a variable works. We will definitely look at more complex variable types at later stages. Remember, slow, steady progress, baby steps!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>Creating a variable and seeing how it works</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's see <a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a>how<a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a> this actually works in our script. Don't be concerned about the details of how to write this; just make sure that your script is the same as the script shown in the next screenshot:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, double-click on <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. The <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span> window should open automatically on <code class="literal">LearningScript.cs</code>.</p></li><li><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>, write the lines <span class="strong"><strong>6</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>11</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>13</strong></span> shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_02_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Save <a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a>the file.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>The best way to save your script is by using a shortcut. If you are using Mac, use <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, and on Windows use <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> +<span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>. We will be saving a new version of the script every time some changes are made to it, so it is a good idea to use a shortcut instead of saving through the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu.</p></div></li></ol></div><p>We have <a id="id50" class="indexterm"></a>added a few lines to our script. Before we check whether it works or what it actually does, let's go through line 6:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public int myNumber = 9;</pre></div><p>In simple words, this line declares a new number type variable named <code class="literal">myNumber</code> and assigns a value of <code class="literal">9</code> to it. We don't want to worry about theory too much now and want to write more code, right? Agreed, but we do need to remember a few things first.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"></a>Declaration</h4></div></div></div><p>To<a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a> create a new variable, we first need to declare it by saying what type of variable it is. In this case, we want to create a number variable. The keyword for whole number variables in C# is <code class="literal">int</code>. We also have to give our variable a name; <code class="literal">myNumber</code> is fine for now. You can use any name you want as long as it does not contain spaces and special characters.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec04"></a>Assignment</h4></div></div></div><p>We have<a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a> created our variable, and now we are giving it a value. To assign a value, we use the equal to sign followed by the value. In this case, it is <code class="literal">9</code>. To close the line, use a semicolon.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Click on Play!</h3></div></div></div><p>Quite <a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a>an exciting moment! Go back from <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span> to Unity, and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button. Unity should print out two lines on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab, looking like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_02_03.jpg" /></div><p>Unity <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>executed the code in the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> component on <code class="literal">GameObject</code> just after you clicked on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>. We can see two lines printed on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. We wrote a piece of code asking Unity to print these two values on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. Let's look again at lines <span class="strong"><strong>11</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>13</strong></span>. Everything inside the brackets in the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> function will be printed to the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. It can be a number, text, or even an equation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_02_04.jpg" /></div><p>So, line <span class="strong"><strong>11</strong></span> is asking, "Hey Unity, print the result of 2 + 9 on the console!" Line <span class="strong"><strong>13</strong></span> is using the <code class="literal">myNumber</code> variable's value directly and adding it to the number <code class="literal">11</code>.</p><p>Thus, the point of this exercise is to demonstrate that you can store and use whatever values you want using variables and use their name directly to perform operations.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Changing variables</h3></div></div></div><p>Since <code class="literal">myNumber</code> is a <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>variable, the value that it stores can vary. If we change what is stored in it, the answer to the equation will also change. Follow the ensuing steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Stop Unity by pressing the <span class="strong"><strong>Stop</strong></span> button and change <code class="literal">9</code> to <code class="literal">19</code> in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab.</p></li><li><p>Notice that when you restart the game, the answer will be <code class="literal">30</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>I bet you have noticed the <code class="literal">public</code> keyword at the very beginning of the line that declares the <code class="literal">myNumber</code> variable. Let me explain what it means. It's called an <span class="strong"><strong>access modifier</strong></span>. We use these to<a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a> specify the accessibility of a variable. The <code class="literal">public</code> keyword means that the variable can be seen by code outside our script. Look again at the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. You can see the value of <code class="literal">myNumber</code> there because it is public. The private keyword, however, means that the variable can be accessed only by code in the same class.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>Private variables are not visible in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. If you wish to control or view them, make them public.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec23"></a>Watching for a possible gotcha when using public variables</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity<a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a> gives us great flexibility with editing or reading public variables in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. You will be using public variables most of the time. Now, I want to make you aware of something that might give you a headache sometimes.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>All public variable values are overridden by the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab.</p></div><p>Let's look back at line <span class="strong"><strong>6</strong></span>; we had assigned our variable a value of <code class="literal">9</code>. This value will be copied to Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. From now on, the value from <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> is taken in to account and not the value in the script, even if you change it. Therefore, be careful as this is very easy to forget.</p><p>In <a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, try changing the value of <code class="literal">myNumber</code> to some other value, even a negative value. Notice the change in the answer in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab.</p></div></div>
