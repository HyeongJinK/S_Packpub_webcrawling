<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec53"></a>The foreach loop</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The <code class="literal">foreach</code> loop is very simple to <a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a>use. It also has the simplest syntax. We<a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a> use the <code class="literal">foreach</code> keyword followed by brackets in this loop. Inside the brackets, you must specify the type of data you want to iterate through inside your loop. Pick a single element variable name. You can name it whatever you like. This name is used to access this variable inside the main loop block. After the name, we write the <code class="literal">in</code> keyword, followed by our List variable name, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_06_01.jpg" /></div><p>I know it's quite <a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a>confusing now, but don't worry too much about the theory. All you need to know as of now is that the code inside the <code class="literal">foreach</code> loop is called as many times as there are elements in <code class="literal">myCollectionVariable</code>. So, if <code class="literal">myCollectionVariable</code> contains 10 elements, the code inside the loop block (highlighted in pink) will be executed 10 times.</p><p>To make it a bit more <span class="emphasis"><em>eye friendly</em></span>, let's look at an actual code example. We will use the family members example from the previous chapter and print every element inside the loop on Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_06_02.jpg" /></div><p>Write the preceding code, add it as a component to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>. Line <span class="strong"><strong>20</strong></span> creates the loop (<code class="literal">foreach</code> <code class="literal">familyMember</code> in <code class="literal">familyMembers</code>).</p><p>Lines <span class="strong"><strong>21</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>23</strong></span> form <a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a>a loop block. As our List contains four elements, this code block will be executed four times, each time with a different value stored in the <code class="literal">familyMember</code> local variable.</p><p>Line <span class="strong"><strong>22</strong></span> simply prints the output on Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. Your output should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287596/graphics/B04245_06_03.jpg" /></div><p>Not that scary, isn't it? Go ahead and play around with the code. You can, for example, add more elements to the <code class="literal">familyMembers</code> List.</p><p>Alternatively, you <a id="id195" class="indexterm"></a>can print the number of characters each element has and so on. The sky is the limit! The <code class="literal">foreach</code> loop can be used with any type of collection, so there are no issues with using it with an <code class="literal">Array</code>, <code class="literal">ArrayList</code>, or even <code class="literal">Hashtable</code>.</p></div>
