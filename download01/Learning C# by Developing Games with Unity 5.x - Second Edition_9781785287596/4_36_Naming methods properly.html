Just as I explained for variables, if you don't use good names, then six months from now, you will be confused.</p><p>Since methods make <code class="literal">GameObject</code> do something useful, you should give your method a name that sounds like an <span class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span>, for example, <code class="literal">JumpOverTheFence</code> or <code class="literal">ClimbTheWall</code>. You can look at those names and know exactly what the method is going to do.</p><p>Don't make them too simple. Suppose you name a method <code class="literal">Wiggle</code>. Sure, you know what <code class="literal">Wiggle</code> means right now, but six months later, you'll look at that and say "Wiggle? Wiggle what?" It takes only a moment more to be a little more precise and write <code class="literal">WiggleDogsTail</code>. Now, when you see this method name, you'll know exactly what it's going to do.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec36"></a>Beginning method names with an uppercase letter</h3></div></div></div><p>Why? We<a id="id129" class="indexterm"></a> do this to make it easier to tell the difference between a class or method and a variable. Also, Microsoft recommends beginning method names with an uppercase letter. If someone else ever looks at your code, they will expect to see method names beginning with an uppercase letter.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec37"></a>Using multiword names for a method</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's use <a id="id130" class="indexterm"></a>this example again:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void AddTwoNumbers ()
{
  // Code goes here
}</pre></div><p>You can see that the name is actually three words squished together. Since method names can have only one word, the first word begins with an uppercase, and then we just capitalize the first letter of every additional word, for example, <code class="literal">PascalCasing</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"></a>Parentheses are part of the method's name</h3></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id131" class="indexterm"></a> method name always includes a pair of parentheses at the end. These parentheses not only let you know that the name is of a method, but also serve an important purpose of allowing you to input some data into the method when needed.</p></div></div>
