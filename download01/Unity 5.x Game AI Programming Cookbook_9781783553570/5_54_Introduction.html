We will learn how to use tools that we are already familiar with to create these simulations: colliders, and graphs.</p><p>On the first approach, we will take advantage of ray casting, colliders, and the MonoBehaviour functions bound to this component, such as <code class="literal">OnCollisionEnter</code>, in order to leverage the need to acquire objects nearby in the three-dimensional world. Then, we will learn how to simulate the same stimuli using the graph theory and functions so that we can take advantage of this way of representing the world.</p><p>Finally, we'll learn how to implement agent awareness using a mixed approach that considers the previously learned sensory-level algorithms.</p></div>
