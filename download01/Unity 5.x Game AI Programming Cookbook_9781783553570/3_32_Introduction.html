That's why we will learn different decision-making techniques that are flexible enough to adapt to different types of games, and robust enough to let us build modular decision-making systems.</p><p>The techniques covered <a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a>in the chapter are mostly related to trees, automata, and matrices. Also, some topics require a good understanding of how recursion, inheritance, and polymorphism work, so it is important that we review those topics if that is the case.</p></div>
