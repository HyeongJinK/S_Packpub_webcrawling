Game worlds are usually complex structures; whether a maze, an open world, or everything in between. That's why we need different techniques for approaching these kinds of problems.</p><p>We'll learn some ways of representing the world using different kinds of graph structures, and several algorithms for finding a path, each aimed at different situations.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that path-finding algorithms rely on techniques such as <code class="literal">Seek</code> and <code class="literal">Arrive</code>, learnt in the previous chapter, in order to navigate the map.</p></div>
