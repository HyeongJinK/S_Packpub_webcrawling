<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec38"></a>Creating a word list</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>One of the most important ingredients for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> is an extensive <span>word</span> list, allowing for a wide selection of words and phrases. The word list should be encoded as a text file, with a new word on each line. This file can be built manually if you know enough words and have enough time, but you'll probably want to download and use an existing list. A <span>word</span> list can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html" target="_blank">http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html</a>. This is the <span class="strong"><strong>English Open Word List</strong></span>, which can be used <span>for</span> many purposes. Additionally, this book's companion files feature the <code class="literal">WordList.txt</code> file (in the <code class="literal">chapter_04</code> folder), which can be imported into Unity as a text resource:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/fd20e24b-655a-4c10-91ae-e11ef58a33c8.png" /></div><p>Importing a word list text file</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"></a>Note</h3><p>For <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, I've added the <code class="literal">WordList.txt</code> file to a <code class="literal">Resources</code> folder. Any folder named <code class="literal">Resources</code> is considered special by Unity. Unity allows resource assets to be loaded and unloaded dynamically at runtime by pathname, rather than by object reference. This means you can delete, replace, and reimport the word list file in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel without Unity and its scripts losing a reference to the asset. This is because they access and read the asset at runtime by pathname, which is always valid so long as the asset remains in the same folder and retains the same filename. More information on resource folders can be found in the Unity documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.html</a>.</p></div><p>You may want to edit or remove specific words from the dictionary, or remove specific characters (such as £, %, and &amp;). These are not so easy to speed-type on a regular keyboard or mobile device, as the user must press key combinations, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key. Ideally, every typed character should be a one-button-press operation (for quick-fire), as opposed to two or more. This enhances the intense, action-packed nature of gameplay. Of course, you can argue the opposite (why not try it and find out?). You can speed-edit text files using a powerful text editor application, such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code. These offer find and replace features as well as other text replacement tools focused on <span>being</span> lightweight and fast text editors. Notepad++ can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html" target="_blank">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html</a>, Sublime <span>Text</span> from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">https://www.sublimetext.com</a>, and Microsoft <span>Visual</span> Studio Code from <a class="ulink" href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>.</p></div>
