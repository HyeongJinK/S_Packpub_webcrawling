Sometimes, other developers will be working in the same room, office, or building. And, when they are, you can connect with them through an internal server or network. Often, developers will be located across the globe, working in different countries and time zones. All of them still need access to the same code and files, however, and thus all of them need access to the same Git Repo. This allows developers to access shared files, make commits, and upload branches. To achieve this, we'll need to use a Remote Repository, as <span>opposed</span> to a Local Repository. In Git, a Repo can be either <span class="strong"><strong>Remote</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Local</strong></span>. A Local Repo is saved on your local hard drive, while a Remote Repo is accessed from a web server. When working with a Remote Repo, users often take a <span class="emphasis"><em>local copy</em></span> of the Remote Repo (a Clone), and use the Clone to make changes that can be uploaded back to the Remote Repo (the Remote) later.</p><p>To create a Remote Repo, you can use a freely available service, such as GitHub or BitBucket. These let you host a Git Repo, with some file size and usage restrictions. This book focuses on creating a Remote Repo with Bitbucket, and then on using this Repo with GitKraken to upload and download files, so let's get started. First, you'll need a free account with BitBucket; ensure that you check the terms and conditions before joining. BitBucket can be accessed from <a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/product" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/product</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/a11349a1-e72f-4ea1-929f-c4cf86768f5f.png" /></div><p>BitBucket is a free service that lets you host Git Repositories</p><p>After opening a BitBucket account, you can easily link this to your GitKraken application. To do this, open <span class="emphasis"><em>GitKraken</em></span> and, from the application menu, choose <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences</code></strong> on Windows, or <strong class="userinput"><code>GitKraken</code></strong><span class="emphasis"><em>|</em></span><strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences...</code></strong> on Mac. This opens the User Preferences window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/140e7ca7-fb78-4922-820c-57835da7c974.png" /></div><p>Accessing GitKraken preferences</p><p><span>From the</span><strong class="userinput"><code>User Preferences</code></strong> window, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Authentication</code></strong> tab and then choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>BitBucket</code></strong> tab. From here, you can enter your BitBucket credentials to link the application:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/620ccdbb-1d87-4846-a4b7-79059ba6405d.png" /></div><p>Entering your GitKraken credentials</p><p>Having linked GitKraken to BitBucket, you can now create new Repositories and clone the existing ones. Let's create a new Remote Repo and then clone it. To do this, select the Init option from the GitKraken start screen, and select the <strong class="userinput"><code>BitBucket.org</code></strong> tab instead of the Local tab (chosen previously):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/5943e0f9-139e-4910-944e-3b3aac76a09a.png" /></div><p>Initializing a New Remote Repo on BitBucket</p><p>From the <strong class="userinput"><code>Init</code></strong> menu, select <span>your</span><strong class="userinput"><code>BitBucket</code></strong> account and then <span>enter</span> a new name for the Repo, along with a description and access level. Public repositories are accessible to the public, while <strong class="userinput"><code>Private</code></strong> Repos can only be accessed by approved users:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/16dbc201-1ce1-4546-a9fc-7d6b83f7c625.png" /></div><p>Completing the creation details for a BitBucket Repo</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Clone after Init</code></strong> option determines whether GitKraken should generate a <span class="emphasis"><em>local copy</em></span> of the new Repo on the computer. If activated, a copy is created after the Repo is created. I'll leave this option activated:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/2d88aae6-b827-4f70-87cc-f93a5ef6bfb7.png" /></div><p>Cloning the Git Repo after creation</p><p>When you're ready, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Repository and Clone</code></strong> button. This first generates a Remote Repo on the BitBucket server and then generates a local copy (Clone):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/99d7f636-7b09-4265-a93f-47ec8c3483fe.png" /></div><p>Generating a new Repo</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note48"></a>Note</h3><p>If authentication fails for BitBucket, ensure that you're logged in via the BitBucket website.</p></div><p>After generating the Repo, a version is created on the server, and a local clone is created on your computer too. You can confirm that the Remote Repo has been created via the BitBucket website. Choose repositories from the top-level menu on the website to a see a list of the created Repos:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e2d4a307-67dd-45d1-b3c5-a6049542ccb3.png" /></div><p>Verify that a BitBucket Repo has been created</p></div>
