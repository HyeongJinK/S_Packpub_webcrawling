This is the central mechanic and main challenge. Each zombie is associated with a <span>word</span> or short phrase chosen randomly from a dictionary for each zombie at level start up. The player must speed-type letters on the keyboard during combat to match the word or phrase for the nearest attacking zombie. If the player makes a mistake by entering the wrong letter, then the current word match is reset; that is, the player must retype the complete word or phrase from the beginning. Only a completely correct entry, letter for letter, qualifies as a match, after which the associated zombie is destroyed. This mechanic means that we must accept keyboard input from the player, such as a standard keyboard for PC and Mac, and onscreen keyboard input from mobile devices, such as iPhones. Traditional keyboard input for typing, however, is only meaningful during combat sections:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/3911bb74-a5e1-443e-a33a-da2c3435f646.png" /></div><p>Type letters to match words</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to follow along step by step, the starting point for this chapter is found in the book companion files, in the <code class="literal">Chapter03/Start</code>Â folder.</p></div></div>
