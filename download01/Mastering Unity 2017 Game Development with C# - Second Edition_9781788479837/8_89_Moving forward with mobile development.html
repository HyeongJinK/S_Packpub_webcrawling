After a long configuration process, you're now <span>ready</span> to start developing for Android within Unity. To start, you should change the Target Development platform within the Unity editor. To do this, select <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Settings...</code></strong> to access the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings...</code></strong> dialog:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/19200018-5822-4473-a846-0844805d4f7d.png" /></div><p>Accessing the Build Settings</p><p>From the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings...</code></strong> dialog, select the Android platform from the platform list, and then choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>Switch Platform</code></strong> button. On selecting this, Unity rebuilds, reimports, and reconfigures all assets for the Target Platform:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/69eef1a3-20e3-4d3b-bb0b-c1f97fa78366.png" /></div><p>Switch platforms</p><p>You can confirm the selected platform from the application title bar. The Target OS will be listed in brackets. This should read <code class="literal">Android</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/903d021f-b7fc-4a17-a252-9b3a360566ba.png" /></div><p>Confirming the target operating system</p><p>Depending on your application, target hardware, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong>, your scenes may look different in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> tabs, as a result of rendering capabilities and supported rendering modes for the target hardware. In some cases, you may need to rebake light mapping, occlusion culling data, or navigation mesh data. In addition, you <span>may</span> need to adjust the supported rendering API. First, determine what the minimum Android specification is, specifying this explicitly from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> settings window. Aim for the highest level possible that is consistent with your target hardware and testing device, as this will give you the widest feature support possible:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/a11cafe6-2c0f-454b-89b2-a166d38b894b.png" /></div><p>Selecting the Minimum API Level for the target hardware</p><p>After selecting the API level, choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>Rendering</code></strong> API to use. By default, this is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>Automatic</code></strong>, and when this is specified, Unity detects your graphic needs and selects the lowest API consistent with them. However, if your scene is not rendering as intended, you may need to change this. To do that, remove the check mark from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Auto Graphics API</code></strong> checkbox, and select an API from the list:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ee02318b-2790-4554-815c-8e17a45483dd.png" /></div><p>Selecting a graphics API</p><p>You should also check out which Rendering Emulation mode is being used by the editor to render your scene in the viewports. Ideally, this should match the Rendering API you are using (from the Player settings window), to get the highest fidelity <span>results</span> between what you see in the viewport and what you'll get on the device. To access the Rendering Emulation, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Graphics Emulation</code></strong> from the application menu, and then choose the API level needed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/9af7323f-d373-4eae-81a1-e45cb57b7720.png" /></div><p>Selecting the emulation mode</p></div>
