To activate Lightmap UVs, select all environment meshes in the Project panel and enable <strong class="userinput"><code>Generate Lightmap UV</code></strong> from the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>. Then, click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong>. This method is useful for generating a second UV channel when one doesn't already exist. This defines how lighting is baked to the lightmap texture. Unity applies an autounwrap projection using settings from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Advanced</code></strong> roll out. If, by contrast, your own meshes already have a custom, second channel, and you can use this channel instead for Lightmap UVs simply by disabling <strong class="userinput"><code>Generate Lightmap UVs</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f43fd744-4110-4a20-8cc2-ee15dbd6da1f.png" /></div><p>Configuring Lightmap UVs</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>For meshes with two UV channels, you can enable <strong class="userinput"><code>Swap UVs</code></strong> from the object Inspector to switch channel order, if needed. This makes the second channel the primary, and the first channel the secondary. The primary channel is used for regular texture mapping and the secondary for Lightmap UVs.</p></div><p>Next, strategically position all lights in the scene, taking care to add as few as possible while maintaining your central artistic vision:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/72121821-789b-42ec-95db-585a02ead64b.png" /></div><p>Adding lights</p><p>Here, I've used point lights. These are especially useful for simulating interior, artificial lights (ceiling or wall). For each light, I specified a color tint (red, green, or blue) and an intensity to enhance the atmosphere and interest. For the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mode</code></strong> field, a value of Baked is specified, which means that every light applies only to baked lighting (lightmapping) and not precomputed GI. In addition, <strong class="userinput"><code>Soft Shadows</code></strong> are specified for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Shadow Type</code></strong>, allowing soft, realistic shadow casting for the environment in the baking process. Remember that being baked lights, they will not factor in any real-time lighting calculations, except through Light Probes, as we'll see soon:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/fce863b9-d7f4-432d-9960-04a622ab23cb.png" /></div><p>Configuring baked lights</p><p>Finally, enable the <strong class="userinput"><code>Static</code></strong> checkbox in the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> for all non-moving environment objects. The best approach here is to use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel to append all environment objects as children of a common root node, and then to mark the root node as static. By doing this, the operation cascades downward automatically to all children. This saves you lots of time from enabling <strong class="userinput"><code>Static</code></strong> for each object separately:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/4637ea40-f4eb-4eb6-b20d-c3a780cba431.png" /></div><p>Creating static environments</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"></a>Note</h3><p>Don't forget to save your scene before lightmapping! Saving is needed as the scene file encodes some important lightmapping data and connections.</p></div></div>
