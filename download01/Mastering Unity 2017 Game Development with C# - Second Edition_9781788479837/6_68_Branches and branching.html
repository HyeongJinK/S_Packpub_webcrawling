There are times during development when your project enters a state that you're happy with. The work <span>may</span> not be completed or final, but you've reached an important milestone that should be committed and saved to the history. At this point, your project can take multiple directions, and you'd like to experiment a little, trying out new ideas or developing clever solutions for new features. On reaching this point, you effectively need to Branch your work. This instructs Git to make a <span class="emphasis"><em>duplicate</em></span> of your work and its history to this point (a new Branch), and then you can make further commits on the new branch, without affecting the history of the original branch. That way, if you make changes <span>that</span> you later decide against or wish to remove, you can simply abandon the branch and return to the original, or make a new branch, and so on.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"></a>Note</h3><p>Branching is great for team collaboration too. Different developers can each work on their own branch of the original work, taking it in their own specific direction. As we'll see soon, Git offers features for merging separate branches together, allowing developers to integrate or sew their work together into the master branch.</p></div><p>Let's try creating a new branch, an offshoot from the master branch that we already have in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project. First, we need to decide which Commit in the master branch should become the starting point for the new branch. In this case, we can simply use the <span class="strong"><strong>Head</strong></span> (topmost commit), but you don't have to do that. You can create a branch from any Commit in the history. Select the head and then right-click on it. From the context menu, choose <strong class="userinput"><code>Create branch here</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/c964b182-cc48-4943-8464-ab2afe270809.png" /></div><p>Creating a new branch from the latest commit</p><p>Next, assign the new branch a succinct but meaningful name that both justifies and describes why it was created. The name should be unique in the Repo; no two branches should ever have the same name. I'll call my <span>branch</span><code class="literal">IdeaPlayground</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/37d98070-39bd-4cac-b0f1-4fb8ffbff2f0.png" /></div><p>Naming a new branch</p><p>After the Branch is created, it's listed in the Branch List, shown to the left of the interface. In addition, the newly created Branch becomes the current Branch, and the contents of the Repo folder change accordingly. A message also appears, indicating that the new Branch is <span class="strong"><strong>Checked Out</strong></span>, which, in Git terminology, means that the Repo folder has been populated with all the files for the current branch, and these can now be edited and committed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/35305f5d-42c6-4eb3-993c-3407c31d62fe.png" /></div><p>Viewing Repo branches from the branch list</p><p>You can easily change between <span class="emphasis"><em>branches</em></span> by double-clicking on their names from the branches list. Doing this checks out the selected branch. Now, by making changes to your Unity project, the updates are made to the current branch. By default, the GitKraken interface displays all changes to all branches in a single hierarchical display:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/b9c3b82b-67c2-4a60-82db-6801e19bf39e.png" /></div><p>Viewing branch contents</p><p>After adding more commits to the new branch, the branch moves ahead of the original. You can easily choose whether specific branches should be shown in the list by clicking on the eye icon next to the branch name. This toggles the visibility of the branch in the history:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/59a96f04-be42-45e4-9484-ad110baa68fa.png" /></div><p>Hiding and showing branches</p><p>You may later decide that your experimentation on the ideas branch worked out well, and now you want to integrate those changes back into the original master branch. This process is called <span class="strong"><strong>Merging</strong></span>, that is, you want to merge the ideas branch into the master branch. To do this, ensure that the destination branch (the master branch) is active by double-clicking on it from the branches list:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/32c95980-eea6-4ebc-b2ac-a8a11ca3373e.png" /></div><p>Selecting the master branch</p><p>Next, right-click on the ideas branch in the branches List and then choose <strong class="userinput"><code>Merge into Master</code></strong> from the context menu. This starts the mesh process. It leaves the merging branch intact and simply updates the destination branch with the newest changes:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/d23d30ce-69ce-4bcc-88f4-627c04610e34.png" /></div><p>Merging into the Master branch</p><p>After the merge is completed, the master branch is updated with the latest changes, and the development history reflects this. The branch history now illustrates the ideas branch merging into the Master, after previously branching from there:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/78c4b78c-fe4f-4c1f-af04-f48e13b5ea8d.png" /></div><p>The branch history illustrates the Merge</p><p>Great! You can now create branches from specified points on the original master, and then merge changes back from other derived branches.</p></div>
