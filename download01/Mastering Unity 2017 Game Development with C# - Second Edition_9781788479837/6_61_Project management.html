We all have to do it to some extent in our everyday lives, but especially when developing games. We must think carefully about the work needed, and then figure out the most practicable way to approach it. Project management is, essentially, about planning your time, workload, and resources to achieve success optimally. The idea is to identify all the work needed, and then to divide it into a sequence of manageable chunks. The following terms and phrases emerge from the <span>project</span> management process.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec61"></a>Research, design, and work assessment</h3></div></div></div><p>Project management begins with careful analysis of the design. This involves examining the <span class="strong"><strong>game design document</strong></span> (a clear statement of the game) and determining how, when properly conceived, it can be implemented optimally. The previous <span>chapters</span> outlined the design for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, and from this, we <span>can</span> extrapolate various levels of work. Try thinking about these, and then write them down using a tree structure. At the highest level, you should include art, sound, and development work. Within the development, for example, we have <span>many</span> systems to develop, from player controls and enemy AI to level logic <span>and</span> camera systems, plus lots more. The degree to which you can dig down into lower levels of work is, potentially, endless. For this reason, you'll need to make informed decisions about when to stop digging, by arriving at small, achievable <span class="strong"><strong>tasks</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>tickets</strong></span>) that can be fully assigned to specific team members for delivery within a reasonable <span class="strong"><strong>deadline</strong></span><span>.......</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ea2772d1-a570-4ed7-8d06-a914cd430689.png" /></div><p>Project work hierarchy</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec62"></a>Workload plan</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>workload plan</strong></span> begins when you <span>have</span> atomized the full workload into discrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned to specific team members, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>create player controls</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>animate a walk cycle for a character model</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>create brick texture</em></span>. Each task will have an <span class="emphasis"><em>assignee</em></span> (a person responsible for its completion), and a <span class="emphasis"><em>deadline</em></span> (the time and date the task should be completed by). In addition, the project manager should arrange <span>tasks</span> sequentially in a timeline or <span class="emphasis"><em>calendar</em></span>, representing the order in which they should be completed; after all, there's no point in texturing a character model before the model has actually been made:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/03c13d1c-4886-4386-a297-e7170e886fe4.png" /></div><p>Task progression</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec63"></a>Task status</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has a <span class="strong"><strong>status</strong></span> within <span>the</span> development timeline, representing how far (or not) work has progressed. The exact name and nature of a <span>status</span> varies from project to project, but there are some general states that a task can be in. First, a task can be in a <span class="strong"><strong>To-Do</strong></span> state. This means a task exists in the plan, has been assigned, but has not yet been started by the assignee. Thus, it's on their list of things <span class="emphasis"><em>to do</em></span>. Next, a task can be <span class="strong"><strong>In Progress</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>, which means the task is currently being addressed by the assignee. Finally, a task can be <span class="strong"><strong>Completed</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Closed</strong></span>. This means the task has, in the judgment of both the assignee and the team, been completed according to the plan, and the assignee is now working on something else. Sometimes, however, a task can be <span class="strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Suspended</strong></span>.</p><p>This happens when a task has been started but cannot be completed now. This can be caused by an oversight by the Project Manager (perhaps not all the necessary tasks were included in the plan), or an unfortunate disruption to the workload (such as a team member falling ill). Most often, it occurs when <span class="emphasis"><em>tasks</em></span> depend on each other and an assignee for another related task has fallen behind schedule so that you are now waiting for them to complete it. The <span class="strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span> status is not usually a persistent state; it typically changes back to <span class="strong"><strong>In Progress</strong></span> when the blocking condition is removed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/c60bf172-8e7c-4116-aa6f-79728e83a31f.png" /></div><p>Task status</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec64"></a>Risk analysis</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has associated <span class="emphasis"><em>risks</em></span>, which should be stated, and these risks can vary in kind. Sometimes, the risk will be financial: How much <span>time</span> and money will task-completion cost, and is it worth it? Sometimes, the risk will be technical: What software, hardware, and skills are needed to complete the task to the required standard? At other times, the risk will be logistical or economic: Will task completion satisfy a market demand? There can be other risks too, but each risk outlines a potential problem that has been foreseen, with a reasonable degree of probability, and they should further recommend a solution to the problem or, at least, a workaround. <span class="strong"><strong>Solutions</strong></span> define how to solve and tackle problems, and <span class="strong"><strong>workarounds</strong></span> define ways of working so that difficult problems are not encountered at all.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec65"></a>Resources and skills needed</h3></div></div></div><p>Each task has requisites, and not just in <span>terms</span> of other tasks. These are all the things needed to complete the task on <span>time</span> and to the specified standard. Each task requires software (such as Unity, Blender, and MonoDevelop), hardware, skills, finances, and time. <span class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> itself is a <span class="emphasis"><em>wasting resource</em></span>, which means that it cannot be refunded once it's spent. This makes time a particularly expensive resource.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec66"></a>Testing plan</h3></div></div></div><p>It's easy to underestimate the testing <span>work</span> for any project. After the game is developed, people must spend time testing it, searching for bugs and issues. It's important to allocate time for testing in advance by creating a testing plan as part of the development schedule. The plan should include tasks specifically for testing. You'll need to test specific components and features, as well as carrying out general testing. In addition, you should allocate time for debugging and fixing any problems found. This can be difficult when estimating time and deadlines, because you're allocating time for unknown bugs with unknown solutions. As a result, allocate the maximum time your schedule allows for testing.</p></div></div>
