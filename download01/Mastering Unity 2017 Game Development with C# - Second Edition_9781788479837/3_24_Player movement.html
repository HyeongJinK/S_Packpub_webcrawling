However, the player doesn't get free-roaming control as with many first-person games using the <span class="emphasis"><em>W A S D</em></span> keys. Here, camera movement through the level is prescripted. Specifically, the camera moves from <span>point</span> to point along a carefully defined path when the player progresses by killing zombies. Nevertheless, the player still has some control over character movement, albeit minor.
