However, revert isn't limited to just that; it can restore a Branch back to even earlier Commits, going back to the very first Commit if needed. To do this, we simply <span>need</span> to find the Commit we <span>want</span> to restore in the branch, and then revert the Commit above that. This makes sense because we're effectively reverting all commits subsequent to the chosen one. Simply right-click on the <span>Commit</span> above the latest, and choose <strong class="userinput"><code>Revert commit</code></strong>. For this example, I am reverting to the first commit:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e45cf7bf-8292-4c20-9594-0fd9db91a6c9.png" /></div><p>Reverting to an earlier Commit</p><p>If you now open a Windows Explorer or Mac Finder window to your Git managed folder, you'll see the file contents updated to reflect the selected Commit on the Active Branch. In Git terminology, we always view the <span class="strong"><strong>Head</strong></span> (topmost Commit) of the <span class="strong"><strong>Current Branch</strong></span> (the selected branch in the Repo). The folder will not include any Unity Projects, because all commits subsequent to the first have now been undone. Note that the folder may contain some additional files. These are files <span class="emphasis"><em>ignored</em></span> by Git, because they satisfy the GitIgnore file. Therefore, Git neither adds ignored files to Commits nor removes them from reverted Commits:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/944480ca-9b66-4f13-8123-4c497e4c3bfc.png" /></div><p>Git controls the file contents of all managed folders</p><p>We can always get our work back from any Commit, simply by using Revert again. This returns our Unity project back to the Repo folder, and this is reflected in either Windows Explorer or Mac Finder:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/1db05806-c7f4-4a73-b28e-492916e44f14.png" /></div><p>Changing the Repo folder contents using revert</p><p>Of course, sometimes the contents of your Repo folder can change unintentionally or automatically, such as when a program generates a <code class="literal">temp</code> file, or when Windows or Mac updates metadata for thumbnail images. Frequently, you don't need these changes; Git will still recognize them and create a new entry in the branch history, creating Unstaged Changes ready for you to Commit:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f40bb5df-710e-48a2-88c6-4e6522f718bd.png" /></div><p>Git often detects unnecessary changes</p><p>When unnecessary or superfluous changes are detected that you don't want to keep as a Commit, you can easily discard them; tell Git to remove <span>them</span> and restore the folder, and all its files, back to the latest commit. To do this, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Discard all Changes</code></strong><span>button</span> from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong> panel. You will be asked to confirm your decision by choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>Reset All</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/bbb6e448-3390-4520-b95c-855a03ef7342.png" /></div><p>Discarding changes with Git</p><p>Great! By using a combination of <span>Revert and Discard</span>, you can now easily choose what should be committed, and you can undo the history back to any earlier Commit.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note46"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on Revert changes, check out the Atlassian help documentation on using Git, at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting</a>.</p></div></div>
