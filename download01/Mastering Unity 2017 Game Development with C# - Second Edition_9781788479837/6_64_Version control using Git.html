However, for programmers <span>and</span> developers, the situation is different. Programmers work collaboratively with code and script files, and this creates some important needs that are substantially different or acute:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">First, coders frequently work together on the same source code. This may involve collaborating on different functions or areas of the same project, and also collaborating on code in the same file. Consequently, they need an easy way to identify lines that have changed between edits, who made the changes, when, and why.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Second, coding often requires developers to explore and experiment with different solutions and techniques. The aim is to reach decisions about which solution is best. This means that coders need an easy way to reverse small- or large-scale changes, restoring a project back to a state before the changes were made.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Third, coders normally like to reuse code from other sources, such as libraries and source files, where it's relevant and saves us work. The basic idea is that code created for earlier projects may be relevant to the latest ones too, so why not merge that code into the existing project instead of reinventing the wheel. Thus, the ability to merge code between projects is really useful!</li></ul></div><p>To conclude, then, coders benefit from a filesystem that identifies <span>and</span> tracks file changes, allows those changes to be reversed, and supports merging behaviors that allow us to reuse and integrate code from external sources. These features, and more, are supported by <span class="emphasis"><em>version control</em></span>. There are two major forms of version control in Unity 2017. One form is <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Teams</strong></span> (formerly known as <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Collaborate</strong></span>) and the other is <span class="strong"><strong>Git</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>Version control</strong></span> as a concept lets us track, reverse, and merge changes, and both <span class="strong"><strong>Unity</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Teams</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Git</strong></span> are simply programs that support version control features. <span>Unity Teams</span> is a really easy way to collaborate <span>with</span> multiple <span>team</span> members on a single project where code and files are shared. More information on this can be found online at <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/teams" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/teams</a>. Moving forwards, Unity Teams will likely merge into a paid option for Unity.</p><p>This chapter will, however, focus on working with <span class="strong"><strong>Git</strong></span> to show you an alternative method of collaboration and to cover a free option. Git is a cost-free, open source program that can be downloaded, installed, and then used to apply version control to your files. When used and configured appropriately, it can be an incredible asset to your workflow. One way to obtain Git is by visiting the Git home page at <a class="ulink" href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/00318aa1-f580-4f61-b088-155c406c48a8.png" /></div><p>The Git home page</p><p>The Git home page provides you with access to the standard, command-line Git tool. However, by default, this tool has no GUI interface. You use it by typing commands and instructions into a console that is syntax sensitive. This means spelling, grammatical, and structural errors will not execute at all, or at least not as intended. This can be awkward for newcomers, who must learn a new syntax, and unintuitive for experienced users, who may be seeking a graphical, point-and-click simplicity. For this reason, we'll consider a specific <span class="strong"><strong>Git client</strong></span> (a program that builds on the fundamental Git framework to extend its features and make it easier to use). Specifically, we'll use <span class="strong"><strong>GitKraken</strong></span>, which is a graphical, free, and cross-platform Git client. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. This program is a completely standalone download and installation, so you don't need to download or install any prerequisite files or packages. To access GitKraken, visit the home page at: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gitkraken.com" target="_blank">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>, and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Download GitKraken</code></strong> button:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/17b65864-c108-4d9e-b152-8b35ef1777ab.png" /></div><p>Downloading GitKraken</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"></a>Note</h3><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>GitKraken</strong></span> home page should autodetect your operating system, allowing you to download the best version for you when clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Download</code></strong> button. However, if the wrong version is selected, you can manually choose a download by selecting the <strong class="userinput"><code>See</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>All Platforms</code></strong> option below the download button.</p></div><p>After downloading the GitKraken package, run the installer program to install the software to your computer. Great work!</p></div>
