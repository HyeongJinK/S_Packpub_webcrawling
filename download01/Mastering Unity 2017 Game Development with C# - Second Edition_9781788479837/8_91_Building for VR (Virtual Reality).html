This is an umbrella term referring to a <span>range</span> of different wearable headsets that surround the eyes and immerse the player in a 3D virtual world. Head movement is tracked (that is, its rotation is monitored) and used to control what is seen through the headset. Typically, head motion <span>controls</span> a first-person camera in a 3D environment. Unity ships with support for selected VR platforms, including Oculus and Samsung Gear. Developing for VR in Unity is made simple in that most 3D concepts apply to VR. There are a range of interesting design considerations that apply to VR, such as interface design, player height variance, object interactivity, and 2D design.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project is <span>not</span> primarily designed for VR, but this section explores a few steps that can be taken toward integrating VR support in principle. To get started with VR development in Unity, you should download the Oculus Development Kit, from: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/" target="_blank">https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note66"></a>Note</h3><p>Currently, VR development with Oculus is supported only on Windows.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/41fe4dd0-cd86-4fcd-8a54-6885c1eff703.png" /></div><p>Installing the VR SDK</p><p>Next, open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings</code></strong> by choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> from the application menu, and from the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, enable the <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual Reality Supported</code></strong> option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/107dffc9-657f-45f5-b9f9-bd86c8b5be98.png" /></div><p>Enabling Virtual Reality Support</p><p>On enabling the <strong class="userinput"><code>Virtual Reality Supported</code></strong> option, you can select the supported SDK. By default, the only option is <strong class="userinput"><code>Oculus</code></strong>; leave this option selected:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/9da034ad-7f69-4b36-a5bc-8bbac7dbeda3.png" /></div><p>Selecting a VR SDK</p><p>Next, download the Oculus Sample Framework for Unity 5, to see a selection of projects and additional classes and libraries for use, from: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/game-engines/1.5.1/Oculus_Sample_Framework_for_Unity_5_Project/" target="_blank">https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/game-engines/1.5.1/Oculus_Sample_Framework_for_Unity_5_Project/</a>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/04e1d65f-e62f-4acd-933b-2f894e7696e3.png" /></div><p>Downloading Oculus Sample Packages</p><p>In addition to the Oculus Sample packages, Unity also has a VR package that features useful scripts and classes that can be used quickly and effectively in VR. This is available for free from the Unity Asset Store at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51519" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51519</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/282ef06f-52c5-4e5e-9730-8d7f90db2bfd.png" /></div><p>Downloading a VR Unity package</p><p>The Unity <span class="emphasis"><em>VR</em></span> package creates two main folders: <code class="literal">VRStandardAssets</code> and <code class="literal">VRSampleScenes</code>. The <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> folder features reusable scripts and classes for many VR projects, and the <code class="literal">Sample Scenes</code> folder contains example <span>scenes</span> demonstrating the use of these assets:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/4fe64ff1-32f4-4197-b3cb-e6c5c296be07.png" /></div><p>Accessing Sample VR Assets</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note67"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on working with assets from the Samples VR project<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> check out the online Unity documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development?playlist=22946" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development?playlist=22946</a>.</p></div><p>Next, a really great step is to download and use the <span class="strong"><strong>VRTK</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality Toolkit</strong></span>). This is a freely available Unity package <span>that</span> contains many prefabs and templates for common VR needs, such as first-person controls, and grabbing and throwing functionality. To access the VRTK, simply visit the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Asset Store</strong></span> and download <span>and</span> import the VRTK package:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/7475458e-a53e-4884-934b-483383c01c83.png" /></div><p>Importing the VRTK Package</p><p>Great work! You're now ready to start working in VR. Thankfully, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> is a first-person project, making it easy to transition to VR. The biggest challenge is in implementing effective keyboard controls when the player cannot see the keyboard because of wearing a VR headset. To solve this issue, you can create a World Space UI for keyboard support, that is, a GUI representation of the keyboard in the world. More information on <span>World</span> Space User Interfaces can be found at: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UIWorldSpace.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UIWorldSpace.html</a>.</p><p> </p></div>
