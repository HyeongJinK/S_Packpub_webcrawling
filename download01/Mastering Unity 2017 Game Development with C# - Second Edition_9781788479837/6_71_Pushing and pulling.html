After making Commits on the Local Repo, the changes are not automatically synchronized to the Remote. This is because <span>changes</span> can be undone, or because the developer doesn't have internet access. For this reason, new Commits and branches remain, by default, on the Local Repo only, until you explicitly Upload (or Push). To Push changes, you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Push</code></strong> button:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/0e82b5a2-fd4d-4ac1-b936-3a9d03627831.png" /></div><p>Pushing local changes to a Remote Repo</p><p>To download the latest changes from an existing Repo and merge them into the Local Repo, you click on the Pull button. This updates the Local Repo with changes on the server. In many cases, this is the equivalent of updating the Local Repo to match the Remote Repo, but it's possible to Pull down changes into a different Local Repo, merging and integrating the changes to make a completely different Repo:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/b17d01dc-db0b-469e-8697-0c1dd1c234dd.png" /></div><p>A Pull operation merges the Remote Repo into the Local Repo</p></div>
