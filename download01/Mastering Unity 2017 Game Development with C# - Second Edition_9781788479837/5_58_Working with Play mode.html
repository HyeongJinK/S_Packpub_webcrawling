You should specifically test that the player can approach a zombie, that a zombie can chase and attack the player, and that the player can attack and defeat enemies:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/3565b5cc-a638-4806-94d1-ccde9774def9.png" /></div><p>Working in Play mode</p><p>During testing, you may decide to make changes, tweaking speeds, stopping distances, health points, and more. Remember that any changes made in Play mode are automatically reverted when playback is stopped. However, you can copy values on components from play mode to edit mode. This makes it easier to adjust values from the Inspector and take them back to edit mode. To do this, click on the <span><span>Cog</span></span> icon from the component being changed, during play mode, and select <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Copy Component</code></strong></span> from the menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/a3af3494-e174-4abb-b1bb-a3e036dfbc2c.png" /></div><p>Copying component values</p><p>Then, back in edit mode, select the same component and click on the <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Cog</code></strong> i</span>con. From the context menu, choose <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Paste Component Values</code></strong></span>. This copies the values between the modes, allowing you to retain your changes from play mode:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/fa3cf611-60ff-404e-8451-1837cf4aa48b.png" /></div><p>Pasting component values</p><p>In addition, when testing in Play mode, it can be easy to forget that we're actually in Play mode. There, we can make changes, and later <span>realize</span> that we made them in Play mode and should not have done so; this can be frustrating. However, Unity does offer us something to mitigate this problem. We can use a feature (<span><strong class="userinput"><code>Play Mode Tint</code></strong></span>) to colorize the interface while in Play mode, helping us remember the currently active mode. To access this feature, navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Edit </span></code></strong>|<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span><strong class="userinput"><code><span>Preferences</span></code></strong> (on a PC) or <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Unity </span></code></strong>| <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Preferences...</span></code></strong> (on a Mac). This displays the <span><strong class="userinput"><code>User Preferences</code></strong></span> dialog:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/7227c114-587b-4761-b16d-59befe32d2c0.png" /></div><p>Accessing User Preferences</p><p>From the <strong class="userinput"><code>User <span>Preferences</span></code></strong> dialog, select the <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Colors</span></code></strong> tab. Click inside the <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Playmode</code></strong> tint</span> swatch and select a color for the interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e603243e-58d1-4fd6-9cf8-ee9b42102fe7.png" /></div><p>Selecting Playmode tint</p><p>Now, press the Play on the application toolbar to <span>launch</span> Play mode, and the interface is immediately colorized with the tint color:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/b802b263-64ca-415a-9210-dfec04af087e.png" /></div><p>Working with Playmode tint</p></div>
