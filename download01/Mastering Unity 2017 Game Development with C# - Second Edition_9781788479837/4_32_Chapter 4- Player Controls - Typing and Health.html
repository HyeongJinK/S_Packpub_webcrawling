This chapter completes player controls development by creating a typing-combat system. Specifically, zombies approach the player to attack, sometimes alone and sometimes in waves. When this happens, a word or phrase is randomly selected from a dictionary and assigned to each attacking zombie; the player must frantically type the matching phrase to destroy the zombies one by one, thereby making progress in the level. This functionality involves many different features within Unity. We'll need a dictionary database, a random select feature, an input system for typing instructions, and UI elements to provide graphical feedback for the input. So, let's jump in and get started.</p></div>
