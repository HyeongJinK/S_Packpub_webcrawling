Git is configured to work with nearly any kind of file, both text and binary (non-text). However, there are some optimization steps we can <span>take</span> to enhance <span>your</span> Git workflow inside Unity. To get started, open your Unity <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project, and then choose <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Editor</code></strong> from the application menu. This displays the Unity Editor preferences in the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f3885bd5-cf45-4156-9fdc-89b5f555c912.png" /></div><p>Accessing the Editor settings</p><p>Next, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Version Control</code></strong> mode from <strong class="userinput"><code>Hidden Meta Files</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Visible Meta Files</code></strong>. By default, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hidden Meta Files</code></strong> option applies the <span class="emphasis"><em>hidden</em></span> tag to all metafiles, excluding them from version control. Metafiles are additional files that Unity generates to accompany all assets (such asÂ <span class="emphasis"><em>Textures</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Meshes,</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Sounds</em></span>) and include configuration options and preferences, such as texture quality and UV Mapping. These files are named with the <code class="literal">.meta</code> extension. When metafiles are hidden, Git will not include them in the Repo. This means that any other users accessing the Repo on a different computer will not have the metafiles. This causes Unity to regenerate a new set of metafiles when the project is opened. That is not necessarily problematic, but can lead to longer loading times when opening Unity projects. Thus, using <strong class="userinput"><code>Visible Meta Files</code></strong> can enhance collaborative Unity development:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/dfe6477e-0a44-48dd-aa60-087a5e5c1ae7.png" /></div><p>Using Visible Meta Files</p><p>Now, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Asset Serialization</code></strong> mode from <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixed</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Force Text</code></strong>. This changes how Unity saves metadata files, including scene files. By using <strong class="userinput"><code>Force Text</code></strong>, Unity saves all metadata in a human-readable, text-based format. This has benefits with Git version control, as we'll see later:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/9ff449fb-2c50-47f8-a162-2e31dcb148ba.png" /></div><p>Using Force Text mode</p><p>You can confirm that Unity is using text mode for asset serialization by opening a scene file inside a text editor. The file will consist only of text instructions and definitions. This does not change how the scene appears in the viewport or during gameplay, but only how the data is stored in the file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f656fdf0-211c-40dc-b927-db548f3190a7.png" /></div><p>Previewing a scene file as a text asset</p><p>Finally, before making any commits to GitKraken, ensure that you exit and close Unity. This is because Unity generates temporary files while running, and it can also open and edit metadata files. Consequently, close Unity and then Commit to GitKraken:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/1d50e711-8ee2-4db4-90f1-668840b91550.png" /></div><p>Updating branch history</p></div>
