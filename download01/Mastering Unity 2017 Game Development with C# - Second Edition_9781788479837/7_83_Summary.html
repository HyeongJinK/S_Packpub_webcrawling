By reaching this point, we have come a long way. We developed <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> from the ground upward, and now the game can track user progress from level to level. This is great, and we saw various methods for saving persistent data in doing this. Next up, we'll complete the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project and cover a wide range of subjects along the way!</p></div>
