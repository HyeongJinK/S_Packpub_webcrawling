Arranging mesh modules meaningfully and constructing a layout that encourages exploration and invites interest is challenging. Is a corridor too long or too bendy? Is a walkway too narrow or too wide? Should there be a prop (such as a chair or a desk) in the corner of a room? These types of question, and others, matter! They're not the kinds of thing that should be settled just by flipping a coin. Consider the following design tips and tricks, which are some guiding principles intended to help you build more interesting levels more quickly and easily.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec25"></a>Objective and feedback</h3></div></div></div><p>Always remember the player objective when designing--the goal to be reached by the player during gameplay; this may be reaching a specific location, defeating a specific enemy, achieving a financial target, or something else. Most players like to <span>feel</span> successful, like they're moving toward that goal. During gameplay, they'll typically look for both <span class="emphasis"><em>overt signs</em></span> of progress (such as mission complete popups and victory sound effects) as well as <span class="emphasis"><em>convert signs</em></span> of progress, such as meeting a friendly unit that offers to help you reach a location, open a hitherto locked door, find the murder weapon in a mystery game, or catch sight of the destination from a high vantage point (such as a watch tower), among others. It's important to reach a balance between these two types of signs or feedback, and to steadily provide them in the level through props, characters, dialog, architecture, special effects, and anything else you can put into a level. If the level features little feedback, the player loses interest, and feels defeated or bored. If the level features too much feedback, the player feels frustrated and overwhelmed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Narrative</h3></div></div></div><p>Many games tell a story. Some stories <span>feel</span> like an integral part of the game, while others feel added on only to facilitate gameplay or a fun mechanic. In any case, the level you build will communicate a story, that is, the engaged player will unconsciously read the environment as they explore (its characters, architecture, and props) for meaningful elements relating to the overarching story. For this reason, ask yourself important questions about the objects that you, as a designer, add to a level, from tables and chairs to doors and windows: why put an object here? What does that reveal? How does it complement the story, if at all? For example, bloody footprints found on the floor speak on many levels to the player. They express harm, murder, and intrigue about an event in the past. They encourage exploration right now: where do the footprints lead, and why? Props such as this are important for generating interest and excitement. However, even a lonely, mundane object such as a chair can take on significance, for example, when positioned alone at the center of a large and creepy room. Who sat there? When and why? It's the curious juxtaposition and relationships between objects that make them interesting and meaningful, and so, it's important not to see the objects as <span class="emphasis"><em>filler</em></span>, as simply things thrown in to use up space and reduce emptiness. Emptiness, in that negative sense, arises not so much from a lack of props and objects, but from a lack of significant objects, objects that make a difference and carry meaning. Therefore, add objects and design levels with consideration for purpose and narration; think about how objects relate to the story, which characters would have used them, and what their location now says about the recent events.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"></a>Believability and convenience</h3></div></div></div><p>There's an important balance to find <span>between</span> believability and convenience; it's easy to sacrifice one for the other. <span class="strong"><strong>Believability</strong></span> is about creating a world that <span class="emphasis"><em>makes sense</em></span>; one that's consistent with your theme, story, technology, characters, and more. In sci-fi, for example, the player may expect to find starships, aliens, and laser guns, but not elves, dragons, and undead mages. These elements simply don't belong. <span class="strong"><strong>Convenience</strong></span>, on the <span>other</span> hand, is about the creative liberties we, as designers, take with the boundaries of reality to make things easier, more fun, or more accessible to the gamer. For example, traveling between villages in an RPG may take only minutes in <span class="emphasis"><em>real time</em></span>, but represent weeks in <span class="emphasis"><em>game time</em></span>. We don't make the <span>player</span> wait for weeks; we typically accelerate time for their convenience. When designing levels, we must find a middle point <span>between</span> these two extremes. Sometimes, we'll move closer to one direction than another, depending on the game. For <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, we'll take a <span class="emphasis"><em>convenience preference</em></span> to facilitate the pick-up-and-play arcade feel. This will be reflected by a linear-level design allowing only one real route, by the staggered placement of enemies and a fixed-path camera. We'll include some props and objects to express a story now and then, but ultimately the experience needs to be smooth, progressive, and clearly action-focused. This damages the believability and narrative, but that's okay! We simply need to recognize that and focus on what's most important for our design and what our aim is--a fast-paced fun experience.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"></a>Atmosphere and aesthetic</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Believability</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>convenience</em></span> typically, though not necessarily, exist in tension; both <span class="emphasis"><em>atmosphere</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>aesthetic</em></span> are complementary, though distinct, aspects. Atmosphere is part of the aesthetic. Atmosphere is how the whole <span>scene</span> manifests and is experienced by the player; the kinds of emotions and feelings it invokes at different times. To decide on the atmosphere, you'll first need to reach decisions about the overarching <span>game</span> aesthetic. This is an artistic decision about how the game looks, feels, sounds, and comes together as a coherent artistic vision--not a specific level, but the game as a whole. Some games are gothic in style, some cyberpunk, some steampunk, and more such styles. These styles define color palettes, sound effects, character types, technology levels, and more. On reaching decisions about the aesthetic, you're thereby given boundaries, visual and audible, for how each level may be styled and structured. Here, concept art, references images, extant music tracks, and even literature can be highly valuable for inspiration that guides level development. In short, don't simply put a scene together without a clear artistic vision guiding the creation of atmosphere. Every level will have an atmosphere, but it should be the result of an intended, planned, and designed atmosphere--as opposed to atmosphere that emerges incidentally from a disjointed mix of meshes.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec29"></a>Simplicity and reuse</h3></div></div></div><p>Simplicity and reuse work hand-in-hand and are important techniques when designing levels. Simplicity is about breaking down the <span>level</span> into reusable <span>blocks</span> or modules, which can be encoded into prefabs. It encourages us to avoid over specificity, that is, to avoid making assets too specific for one purpose. Sometimes this cannot be avoided, but where possible, it should be. For example, when designing a straight-section prefab for a corridor scene, it can be developed with or without a statue mesh. Including the statue mesh alongside the corridor as a single prefab is more specific than omitting the mesh. Therefore, in this scenario, try creating the corridor without the statue, and only add the statue to specific straight-sections where needed. This simplifies the straight-section prefab. From this kind of simplicity comes reusability, which is the ability to easily reuse the straight section again and again for different purposes, without the repetition being obvious. Such reusability makes it possible to construct complex arrangements, and large levels, from only a limited collection of simple pieces.</p></div></div>
