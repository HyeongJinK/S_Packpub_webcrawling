As mentioned, the main interesting area of the UI here is the forward pointing UI arrow (navigator button), which should appear after all <span>zombies</span> are killed and allows the player to continue on their journey through the environment, moving to the next ambush point. As we create this, we'll explore many interesting UI tips and tricks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f7be8304-9ede-4f71-8a78-dbc275ae9f7b.png" /></div><p>Navigator button</p><p>First, let's create a new empty object to contain all UI elements, including the navigator button to be added in this section, and the remaining elements for later. In addition, add this object to the UI layer in the scene using the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>. In general, strive to keep all UI elements on the UI layer, or another dedicated layer that's separate from the non-UI objects. Doing this gives the power and flexibility to easily show and hide UI elements as well as delegate their rendering to specific cameras:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f05c7c60-ad4f-4114-b761-4f737627ce09.png" /></div><p>Assigning an object to the UI layer</p><p>Next, create a UI canvas object. The canvas is a special UI object that acts as a surface or layer onto which UI elements may be rendered to cameras. As you create the canvas in the scene, assuming that this is your first UI object, Unity automatically creates an <strong class="userinput"><code>EventSystem</code></strong><span>in the</span> hierarchy. This object is essential for linking the UI to input, allowing UI objects to detect keyboard, click, and tap input events. If your scene doesn't <span>have</span> an <strong class="userinput"><code>EventSystem</code></strong> after creating an UI element, you can always create one manually, by choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong> from the application menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/f6e14fb0-9d29-4772-99f1-a1cc6dbf67bf.png" /></div><p>Assigning an object to the UI layer</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>EventSystem</code></strong> features two notable components: an Event System component and an input module. The <strong class="userinput"><code>EventSystem</code></strong> is the nerve center for events and its main duty is to match up abstracted player input (from the input module) to specific objects and events in the scene, such as button clicks on UI buttons. The input module is responsible for mapping hardware specific input into a generalized abstracted input that the <strong class="userinput"><code>EventSystem</code></strong> uses for firing events. There are several kinds of input module components and each varies to accommodate specific hardware types. These are <strong class="userinput"><code>Standalone Input Module</code></strong>Â for handling keyboard and mouse input from desktop systems, and touch input modules for mobile devices such as phones and tablets:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/8a8ff92a-e5f7-4bde-a458-e986b16c0453.png" /></div><p>EventSystems with input modules</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec38"></a>Input axes</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span>input</span> module features several named axes. An input axis is a named, linear space that maps to an input device and typically generates normalized <span>values</span> when input events are received. For example, the horizontal axis, by default, maps to the left and right keys on the keyboard. Left corresponds to <code class="literal">-1</code>, right corresponds to <code class="literal">1</code>, and pressing nothing corresponds to the neutral <code class="literal">0</code>. This convention is especially convenient for creating movement scripts with vectors. Other input axes are officially buttons, which have an on and off (boolean) status instead. The named input axes can be accessed, edited, and configured from within the Unity editor, by choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Input</code></strong> from the application menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/12c7d5e9-ec56-485c-b992-043ee64f2388.png" /></div><p>Accessing input axes</p><p>Using the Axes menu from the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, you can customize input mappings, that is, you change how keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad controls relate to the <span>input</span> axis and generated values. You can add additional <span>input</span> Axes with any name and configure them to specific controls (such as mouse presses and keyboard events), and you can even add multiple Axes with the same name, mapping them to different controls. This is useful when you need two key assignments to perform the same action in game, for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>W A S D</em></span> and keyboard arrows both mapping to horizontal and vertical Axes controlling character movement:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/9e71b290-d8a9-49d7-a960-64a0a700b4d2.png" /></div><p>Configuring input Axes</p><p>For <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, the default controls may be left as is; they work as intended. Be careful not to delete the default Axes, as this <span>can</span> invalidate many standard <span>asset</span> packages that ship with Unity, causing problems with your game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/a8e74ab6-86f6-49a4-ab7e-bfb158a396b0.png" /></div><p>Duplicating input Axes</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec39"></a>The canvas</h3></div></div></div><p>On creating a <span>canvas</span> object, you can now <span>build</span> a user interface. First, let's fix the resolution of our game to <strong class="userinput"><code>16:9</code></strong> from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> tab. This will be important to preview the UI in screen space at an appropriate aspect ratio. To do this, switch to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> tab and choose <strong class="userinput"><code>16:9</code></strong> as the screen aspect ratio:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/6b4547c3-3b35-415b-a268-91f316e500f5.png" /></div><p>Setting aspect ratio</p><p>Now, select the canvas object. From the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Render Mode</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Screen Space - Overlay</code></strong>, via the <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas</code></strong> component, if this mode is not already selected. In this mode, the UI on the selected canvas appears on top of everything, literally. It is the highest rendered object and needs no camera for its rendering. Thus, all cameras could, in theory, be deleted from the scene and still our canvas object would render if it were visible. This can be both beneficial and problematic. It's beneficial because we don't need any additional scene cameras to render the UI, but sometimes problematic because we lack control over depth sorting of objects. For example, if we want to fade out the screen using a black overlay, or obscure the UI with other objects or stencils, then we'll need to use a different render mode:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/d6772247-2181-4632-98e5-18cc13abfe52.png" /></div><p>Changing canvas Render Mode</p><p>Next, let's focus on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas Scaler</code></strong> component, which can be especially important for resizing your UI to fit different resolutions and devices. Change the <strong class="userinput"><code>UI Scale Mode</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Scale</code></strong> with <strong class="userinput"><code>Screen Size</code></strong>. This property can be one of three modes, discussed here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Constant Pixel Size</strong></span>: This ensures that UI textures all display on screen in their pixel-accurate sizes, in both <span>width</span> and height. Thus, a texture of <span class="emphasis"><em>100x100</em></span> pixels will consume that many pixels in each dimension, regardless of screen size. This means that higher resolutions (with more pixels) can make your textures look smaller, as they remain at their original size.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scale With Screen Size</strong></span>: This proportionally stretches or shrinks the <span>width</span> and height of UI textures according to the screen resolution. If the resolution increases, the textures increase in size proportionally, and so on. This mode can be useful for resizing UI elements for different resolutions, but it can cause stretching or pixelation when stretched to a differing aspect ratio or to a much higher or lower resolution than the original.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Constant Physical Size</strong></span>: In this mode, the UI textures <span>retain</span> their sizes based on measurements other than pixels. Valid forms of measure include points, centimeters, millimeters, inches, and picas.</li></ul></div><p>After choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>Scale With Screen Size</code></strong>, set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Reference Resolution</code></strong> to <code class="literal">1920</code>x<code class="literal">1080</code>. This specifies the default resolution, or more accurately, the resolution at which the UI was designed. It may be displayed at runtime at potentially many resolutions, both higher and lower, but it will have been designed at a specific, native resolution; This is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Reference Resolution</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/b6808a99-708b-41b2-8a66-15d737a12c64.png" /></div><p>Changing the Reference Resolution</p><p>Ensure that the canvas <span>object</span> has a <strong class="userinput"><code>Graphic Raycast</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code><strong class="userinput"><code>er</code></strong>Â (Script)</code></strong> component. This ensures that touch and keyboard input from the input <span>module</span> is dispatched to graphical elements in the UI as events, which are sent to the appropriate objects. In short, without this module, all input (clicks, tabs, and key presses) will be ignored for UI objects on this canvas:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/34b4a59e-40b9-42d8-97e5-f5bdc7a772ca.png" /></div><p>Enabling the Graphics Raycaster</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember that the canvas object should be attached to the UI layer.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec40"></a>The button</h3></div></div></div><p>The canvas object is now properly configured <span>for</span> a multiresolution setup. Due to the C<strong class="userinput"><code>anvas Scaler</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>(Script)</code></strong>Â component, it can be resized automatically to fit many resolutions and devices, from desktop computers to mobile devices. However, the <span>canvas</span> object right now has no controls or widgets on it; buttons, images, or text edits, and so on. Specifically, we need to add the forwards button. To do this, select the canvas object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel, and right-click on it. From the context menu, choose <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Button</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/17b7b4de-89fa-4584-bde7-55fe086c7c70.png" /></div><p>Adding the UI button</p><p>All newly added buttons appear as a default, white button, which should be clickable. When adding your first interactive object, however, it's a good idea to test-play your game, moving your mouse cursor over the button to confirm <span>that</span> it responds <span>by</span> changing appearance, detecting input. If it doesn't, then you should check your <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> setup and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Graphic Raycaste</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>r</code></strong> component on the canvas object:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/4e79848e-31aa-4efa-aa5a-308d331123eb.png" /></div><p>Adding a forwards button</p><p>Assuming that the default button works as intended (that is, it responds to user input), we're ready to customize its appearance. To do that, select the button and, from the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, drag and drop your button texture into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> field of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> component:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/23fb809c-9e3c-4885-a066-7641129ef692.png" /></div><p>Customizing button appearance</p><p>Normally, the reconfigured <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong><span>field</span> leaves the <span>button</span> distorted and wrongly sized. You can correct this easily by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Set Native Size</code></strong> button from the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>. This returns the button to its native size, combined with the settings of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas Scaler</code></strong> component:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/0bbfc29a-a354-4943-83cf-f15addaa1a5e.png" /></div><p>Setting a button to native size</p><p>In addition to configuring button size, its position should also be carefully defined. Although the newly created button happens (in this case) to be at the screen center, in the appropriate place, your buttons may not always be aligned like that. You can use the transformation tools (move, rotate, and scale) to move the objects into place on screen, but if the screen resolution and aspect ratio change at runtime, it's possible for the button to <span class="emphasis"><em>slip out of place</em></span> and even (potentially) out of the screen. To solve this problem, we can use anchors to fix the object in place. To do this, click on the anchor button from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Rect Transform</code></strong> component in the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> to view a selection of anchor presets:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/dda41390-74ba-4e1a-b66e-1d428b897379.png" /></div><p>Choosing an anchor point</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>Rect Transform is the 2D, UI equivalent of the transform component. More information on <strong class="userinput"><code>Rect Transform</code></strong> can be found in the online Unity documentation at:Â <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RectTransform.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RectTransform.html</a>.</p></div><p>Each UI object has four anchor points, one at each corner. These points can be locked (anchored) to known screen locations, which all screens have (namely, top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left, center, middle-left, middle-right, middle-top, and middle-bottom). The anchors, therefore, align the edges of a UI element in line with specific screen edges so that, if the screen is resized, the element may move or change (if needed), except for the edges, where it is anchored. Thus, by centering the <span>button</span> at the screen center, we lock the <span>button</span> in position, and it will always be at the center for every resolution and every aspect ratio:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/afded289-9b81-429c-a6f1-57cd7ff2a4cf.png" /></div><p>Centering the anchor</p><p>In addition to the anchor, each UI element has a pivot point, as specified in normalized coordinates. The pivot point represents the coordinate center of an object (its center of rotation); the position within a UI rectangle that actually moves to the specified X, Y, and Z position in world space when an object is translated. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Pivot</code></strong> for the forwards button should be its center; in normalized coordinates, this is <code class="literal">0.5</code> x <code class="literal">0.5</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/8847c715-a3c9-4a9e-9085-9cd4ba0840c2.png" /></div><p>Centering the pivot point</p><p>Finally, let's tag the <span>button</span> appropriately, as we'll use this <span>soon</span> from script. Select the button object on the canvas and assign it a <strong class="userinput"><code>NavigatorButton</code></strong> tag via the object <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e33e236e-da70-436e-b185-476731b84b3f.png" /></div><p>Assigning a tag to the navigator button</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec41"></a>Coding button behavior</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, we'll link <span>button</span> clicks to the <code class="literal">Navigator</code> class for moving the camera forward. First, let's refine the <code class="literal">Navigator</code> class, which we started earlier, to support <span>camera</span> movement from the animator graph.

With the death animation, the camera simply falls to the floor and rolls over, and this can interrupt gameplay at any time. The death animation will, of course, occur when the <span>player</span> is killed by a danger in the scene, such as a zombie attack. To get started on creating this, select the navigator object, and then add a new animation from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animation</code></strong> window by clicking onÂ <strong class="userinput"><code>Create New Clip...</code></strong>; create a new animation clip called <code class="literal">anim_Die</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/4bb29eb3-e960-471f-a2af-95f298830c55.png" /></div><p>Creating a new animation clip (anim_Die)</p><p>Creating this clip involves a challenge concerning object transformation. Specifically, the death animation may potentially occur anywhere in the scene, at the beginning, middle, end, or elsewhere. This means that the world position (X, Y, Z) at which death can occur is undefined; it can be anywhere. Consequently, we cannot animate for death at the root level of the navigator object because its position values are baked into the animation in world space. If we created a death sequence on the navigator object, as death occurs, the camera will always snap to a single, specified position, as this is coded into the animation. To fix this, we'll use a relative transformation, that is, we'll animate a child object of the navigator, namely, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> object. To do this, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Property</code></strong> button from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animation</code></strong> window and, instead of selecting the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> component (which applies to the navigator object), choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> child object, and then select its <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> component, both position and rotation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/160ffed6-a174-4b1f-a76a-afaf67e527e0.png" /></div><p>Selecting the Player Transform component</p><p>This adds an animation track for both the position and rotation keys for the player object, which is a child of the navigator.

Now, animate the camera to a <span>falling</span> position over time, using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animation</code></strong> window to create the death animation. You could also add a fade-to-black animation too:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e14a168f-1a5e-4cc0-8c62-e3eb41c647f9.png" /></div><p>Creating a death animation</p><p>Great!

The death animation node has no outward connections, since death is a one-way trip.
