This process has two especially important functions for games: firstly, save-game states allow the player to save and resume their progress in-game, and secondly, <span class="strong"><strong>Data Driven Design</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DDD</strong></span>) lets <span>developers</span> store huge databases (such as weapon and player stats) in text files and spreadsheets to drive gameplay elements. The first use case interests us here for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, allowing the player to save their progress as they move through levels. Let's get started.</p></div>
