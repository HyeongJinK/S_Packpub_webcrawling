In reaching this far, we developed the first half of the player controls, namely, first-person camera navigation, complete with camera animations, Mecanim graph, and a UI button. Using these features, we can navigate the player around the scene using fixed animations. However, the first-person functionality is still incomplete; we lack the ability to type and attack zombies, we lack dictionary functionality, enemies, and lots more. These topics will be addressed in the next chapter.</p></div>
