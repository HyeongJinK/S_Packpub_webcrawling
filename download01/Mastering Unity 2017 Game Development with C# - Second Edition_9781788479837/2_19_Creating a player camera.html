<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec25"></a>Creating a player camera</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The camera object is, in many ways, the most important in any scene, because without the presence of at least one camera, the scene can't be rendered at all. <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> will eventually feature multiple cameras, each with a dedicated purpose. However, let's focus on the main camera, that is, the player perspective in the scene now. For first <span>person</span> games, you can create a camera easily by dragging and dropping a <strong class="userinput"><code>First Person Controller</code></strong> from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel into the scene, from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Characters</code></strong> asset package. However, for Dead Keys, we don't need that; our camera path is fixed as it moves through the level and the user doesn't need free-look controls with the mouse or <span class="emphasis"><em>W A S D</em></span> keys. Consequently, we'll create a custom camera from the ground upwards.</p><p>Let's start by creating a camera object by navigating to <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera</code></strong> from the application menu. This adds a fresh, new camera to the scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/79068c98-013e-4d5b-961a-5d0672d00d99.png" /></div><p>Previewing Occlusion Data</p><p>Each object in the scene may be tagged, using either a predefined tag or a custom tag. The purpose of a tag is to help Unity quickly and easily identify specific objects or types of objects, especially in code. Each scene should have one and only one <strong class="userinput"><code>MainCamera</code></strong>, that is, one camera object tagged as <strong class="userinput"><code>MainCamera</code></strong>. For <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>, and for most games, this should be the main player camera. This will be highly important for our code, as it relies on the <strong class="userinput"><code>MainCamera</code></strong> tag to find the one and only player camera. Thus, tag the player camera as <strong class="userinput"><code>MainCamera</code></strong>, using the object tag dropdown from the object Inspector:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/324716f1-e276-49fd-8a63-2ad47111b0ea.png" /></div><p>Tagging cameras as the MainCamera</p><p>Set the camera <strong class="userinput"><code>Projection</code></strong> method to <strong class="userinput"><code>Perspective</code></strong>, which renders the scene in <span class="emphasis"><em>true 3D</em></span>, applying foreshortening effects to objects, making them smaller in the distance. In addition, set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Field of View</code></strong> to <code class="literal">60</code> to more closely imitate the human field of vision, and adjust the <strong class="userinput"><code>Clipping Planes</code></strong> to <code class="literal">0.3</code> for <strong class="userinput"><code>Near</code></strong>, and <code class="literal">32.2</code> for <strong class="userinput"><code>Far</code></strong>. You may need to use <span>trial</span> and error to adjust the latter settings. The ideal value for <strong class="userinput"><code>Near</code></strong> is the highest value that allows the camera to move closest to a mesh without clipping, and the ideal for <strong class="userinput"><code>Far</code></strong> is the lowest value that allows the farthest object to be seen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ec8273f3-ee4d-4b05-a831-f09acc05915c.png" /></div><p>Configuring projection, Field of View, and Clipping Planes</p><p>Now, ensure that <strong class="userinput"><code>Occlusion Culling</code></strong> is enabled for the player camera from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera</code></strong> component. Furthermore, all cameras that can display scene meshes should have <strong class="userinput"><code>Occlusion Culling</code></strong> enabled:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/fd388f6e-c5a3-4648-b35b-911ec7223377.png" /></div><p>Enabling Occlusion Culling</p><p>Finally, let's apply a <strong class="userinput"><code>Culling Mask</code></strong> to the camera. This specifies which scene layers (and their associated game objects) should be included or excluded from the camera. For the player camera, exclude the UI layer to prevent double rendering of the UI. A separate camera will be dedicated to UI rendering, as we'll see later. To exclude the UI from renders, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Culling Mask</code></strong> dropdown and disable the <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> layer:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/2fafcf37-1640-49c6-bd78-995cd2861c21.png" /></div><p>Specifying a camera culling mask</p><p>Good work! You've now configured a camera, at least initially, for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>; a prescripted first-person game. Later, we'll have reasons to tweak <span>some</span> camera settings, but for now, these will work fine.</p></div>
