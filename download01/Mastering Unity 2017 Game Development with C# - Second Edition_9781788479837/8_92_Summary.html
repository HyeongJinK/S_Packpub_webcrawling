You've now reached the end of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project, and the end of this book. In reaching this far, you've seen a wide range of Unity features, but more importantly, you've seen how many of the features that you already know can be adapted and applied cleverly in an editor to get the results you need. Complexity in Unity is largely about the clever application of existing, simple features rather than the use of hidden features or advanced tools. In reaching this point, you have a Dead Keys project that supports a single player experience on desktop platforms. In the previous chapters, we saw how this experience can be deployed to mobiles, support persistent data, be adapted to VR, and how version control can be integrated into our main development workflow!</p><p>The question that now remains is how you should proceed after reading this book. On reaching this point, it's a good idea to think about the kind of games you want to make professionally, identifying the genre and style, such as Horror FPS, Fantasy RPG, or Sci-Fi RTS. After deciding on these points, there are many directions you can go in. You might want to check out specific books and courses focusing on game types, or focus on specific subjects relevant to your genre. Consider the following titles from Packt:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Building an FPS Game with Unity</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>John P Doran</em></span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Unity Shaders and Effects</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Jamie Dean</em></span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Procedural Content Generation for Unity Game Development</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Ryan Watkins</em></span></li></ul></div></div>
