In this chapter, we completed a critical part of <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>. Specifically, we created an intelligent zombie NPC that wanders the level, attacks the player, and can also be attacked themselves in typing combat. This is a significant milestone in the project because now, we have united many classes and features to create a working core mechanic. In the next chapter, we'll move forward to enhance our workflow even further.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
