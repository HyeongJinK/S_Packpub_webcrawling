<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec64"></a>Applied project management using Trello</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now, let's look at a practical <span>tool</span> for managing our workload for <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span>. There are many tools available, ranging in features, complexity, and cost. Here, we'll <span>focus</span> on <span class="strong"><strong>Trello</strong></span>, a free web-based work management program. You can access <span>Trello</span> from its official home page at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">http://www.trello.com</a>. Trello lets you design your workload using a vertical, column-based <span class="strong"><strong>Kanban</strong></span> board, as we'll see. More information on <span>Kanban</span> Boards <span>can</span> be found online at: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board</a>. Here's what Trello looks like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/5c1815c2-2305-47ed-a6ed-f4f107f820a5.png" /></div><p>Accessing Trello</p><p>After signing up to Trello, you should create a new team. A <span class="emphasis"><em>team</em></span> represents a collection of Trello users who can share site content together for collaboration. It's a good idea to add all the members of your team so that everybody can view and track a project's progress. To do this, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create a new team...</code></strong> button from the main interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/dd47328c-8f52-4217-9b3c-59ad68f6aa4f.png" /></div><p>Creating a new team</p><p>Assign your team a meaningful name and description, clearly outlining the project to be created in a way that's accessible to everybody on the team. Take your time writing an appropriate title and description. These small details are important and make a big difference to how people see and value your project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/51846903-08a9-44fe-8bd0-e9d98a04e9b3.png" /></div><p>Describing a new team</p><p>You've now created a team <span>and</span> the contents can be shared by one or more Trello users. Let's start by adding members to the team, where needed. To do this, switch to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Members</code></strong> tab and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Add by Name or Email</code></strong> to add a single <span>and</span> specific user, or choose <strong class="userinput"><code>Bulk Add Members</code></strong> to paste in a list of email addresses and add members in the block:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/b9ade01e-ff90-4ad5-9f49-a6da1bd9bb4f.png" /></div><p>Adding team members</p><p>After adding all your team members, you're ready to create a new board. A good approach is to create a single board for each team member and their work. Sometimes, you'll need more if the workload is heavy. Each board works like a billboard or notice board, where notes, pictures, tasks, and information can be viewed and changed by the team. To create a board, just click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create new board...</code></strong> option from the website menu, or use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Boards</code></strong> tab from the team page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/a7b040e5-d005-4f17-9262-199787553271.png" /></div><p>Creating a new board</p><p>Every new board begins empty, clear of all tasks and information. At this point, we should first structure the board, to arrange our tasks and deadlines within an established framework. One approach is to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Kaban</strong></span> method. This refers to a vertical column format in which four columns are created: <strong class="userinput"><code>To-Do</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>In Progress</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Completed</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Blocked</code></strong>. Tasks are then moved individually, like sticky notes, between the columns as they are started and completed. This helps us easily visualize the status of particular tasks in the workload. To get started using the Kanban method, click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Add a list...</code></strong> from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Boards</code></strong> page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ef4c04a1-eed6-46f2-8ae3-8804c177e0f2.png" /></div><p>Creating a new list</p><p>Each created list needs a name. Name them <strong class="userinput"><code>To-Do</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>In-Progress</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Completed</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Blocked</code></strong>. Arrange the lists chronologically from left to right. You can drag <span>and</span> drop the lists to reorder them if needed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ecc335e6-e54f-4a37-8f2b-f9f65ea70532.png" /></div><p>Creating a Kanban board</p><p>Having created a Kanban board, it's time to add tasks to the list. Trello names them as <span class="strong"><strong>Cards</strong></span>. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>To-Do</code></strong> list and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add a card...</code></strong> button on the list.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip41"></a>Note</h3><p>All newly created tasks should be in the <strong class="userinput"><code>To-Do</code></strong> list to begin with.</p></div><p>Give the card an appropriate name for the task. I'll start by creating some coding/development tasks. Once named, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button. We can adjust its properties afterward:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/282557ac-2568-4aa4-a2c3-1c09742c20ef.png" /></div><p>Creating a new development card</p><p>Now that the first task has been created, let's adjust its properties: add an assignee and a deadline, as well as notes and any attached information. To do that, click on the pen icon to edit the task's properties:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ed77c7d7-3898-4da0-a5d5-9921851d4185.png" /></div><p>Accessing a task's properties</p><p>Let's first assign the task a deadline (due date). Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Change Due Date</code></strong> button, and then select a date from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Calendar</code></strong> field. Ensure that you assign all tasks a deadline because having a real, concrete date applied to a task helps you focus on getting the task completed. <span class="emphasis"><em>Deadlines</em></span> protect you from procrastination and putting off tasks until an unspecified time:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/3a5c862b-4413-4687-b6c8-33e4e1c33a08.png" /></div><p>Setting a task deadline</p><p>Now, let's assign the <span>task</span> a team member, and apply a label to it. <strong class="userinput"><code>Labels</code></strong> let you color code tasks to <span class="emphasis"><em>visualize importance</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>priority</em></span>. The color red should <span>indicate</span> a high-priority task. Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Team Members</code></strong> to assign members to the task and then click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Labels</code></strong> to choose a color:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/e187b0fe-7e7c-4142-b637-dca9d37cb73a.png" /></div><p>Applying labels to a task</p><p>Completing some tasks may involve multiple steps or discrete stages; for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Enemy AI</em></span> can be broken into the implementation of several states (<strong class="userinput"><code>Patrol</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Chase</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Attack</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Death</code></strong>) as we saw in earlier chapters. We add these details to a task through <span class="strong"><strong>checklists</strong></span>, where each state can be <span class="emphasis"><em>checked off</em></span> by the assignee as the relevant work is completed. To do this, click on the task name from the list, and then choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>Checklist</code></strong> button from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong> dialog:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/38cd8bdf-9b5e-4d3a-8c72-2fcfb0f80fdd.png" /></div><p>Creating a checklist</p><p>Assign the checklist a unique and meaningful name. Then, from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Checklist</code></strong> creator, add checklist fields for each of the <strong class="userinput"><code>AI States</code></strong>. Name these items <code class="literal">Patrol</code>, <code class="literal">Chase</code>, <code class="literal">Attack</code>, and <code class="literal">Dead</code>. Ensure that you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button after <span>naming</span> each state, adding the <span>state</span> to the checklist:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/797e2e0a-d972-4a82-8d6a-1c3f3f8e933b.png" /></div><p>Adding checklist items</p><p>Now, by activating the checkboxes in the list, you increment the progress status of the task. This appears both in the progress bar view from the properties dialog, and in the summary view from the tasks list. This is a handy way to keep track of the progress of specific tasks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/66db270f-257e-4ad2-801c-ec68c8e30c1c.png" /></div><p>Making progress with checklists</p><p>You can also use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Subscribe</code></strong> option on another member's task to be automatically notified by email whenever changes are made to the task's status. This is useful if you have many people to keep track of and don't want to repeatedly log in to Trello to review the status of tasks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/29ff9968-c170-4f13-b7ba-51984e1579a5.png" /></div><p>Subscribing to a task</p><p>Now repeat the process to create more <span class="emphasis"><em>tasks</em></span>, building up a workload schedule for the complete <span class="emphasis"><em>Dead Keys</em></span> project. As you add <span>more</span> tasks and populate the Trello board, you'll be able to move tasks between columns to reflect their completion status. Great work! Being able to project manage your work collaboratively in this visual way will help you <span>work</span> more quickly and empower your team, especially when different members are located in different countries and time zones:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788479837/graphics/ec9e8ee1-234b-4284-866c-e97b4dc0af6a.png" /></div><p>Building a Kanban board for Dead Keys</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"></a>Note</h3><p>So, we've seen how <span class="emphasis"><em>Trello</em></span> helps us manage our work effectively and easily both for small and large teams, whether they are locally based or distributed across the globe.
