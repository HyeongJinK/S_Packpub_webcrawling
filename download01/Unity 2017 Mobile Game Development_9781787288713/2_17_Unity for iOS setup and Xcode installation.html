With Android, there's a lot of setup, but building and getting it on your device is more work, whereas, with iOS, there's less work on the setup end and more involvement with getting it actually onto the device.</p><p>Previously, you had to have a paid Apple Developer license in order to get your game onto an iOS device. Although that's still required to get the game on the App Store, you are no longer required to get it for testing. Note that the free option doesn't have everything available to you, most notably IAPs (In-App Purchases) and the Game Center; however, for making sure that it works on your device, it'll work just nicely. We will go over how to adjust your project to reflect being in the Apple Developer portal in the final chapter when we go over putting our project on the App Store.</p><p>To develop for an iOS device, in addition to the device itself, you'll also need to go on a Mac computer that runs OS X 10.11 or later version. I'll be using 10.12.3 macOS Sierra. Just like working with Android, we'll also need to do some setup before we can actually do the exporting. Let's get started on that now:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>First of all, if you haven't done so already, you'll need to add <strong class="userinput"><code>iOS Build Support (*)</code></strong> as an option when you are installing Unity. If you did not install it when doing the initial installation, you may reinstall Unity again with those selections checked for the platforms that you're trying to build:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/8a792799-35db-4c86-9791-50fa388505b4.png" /></div><p></p><p>This makes it so you can export your projects for iOS. Since I'll be using my Windows machine mainly, I'm only adding in iOS support, but you can do both from your Mac computer:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>You'll also need to have <span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span>, which is the program used to build iOS apps. To download it, you'll need to open up the App Store application on your computer. From the search bar in the top-right corner, type in Xcode and press <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Enter</strong></span></em></span>:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/14b9ad75-31db-4d7d-b946-4284413a5745.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>From there, you'll see the Xcode program at the top left of the page--click on it and then on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Install</code></strong> button. You may need to enter your Apple ID information; go ahead and do so and then wait for it to finish.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>If you do not have an Apple ID, you may get one from: <span><a class="ulink" href="http://appleid.apple.com/" target="_blank">http://appleid.apple.com/</a>.</span></p></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Once Xcode is installed, open it up. There will be a license agreement for Xcode and the iOS SDK; go ahead and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Agree</code></strong>. It'll then begin installing components that are needed for it to work.</li><li>You'll then be brought to a welcome screen, but we want to do some setup first. From the top menu bar, go ahead and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Xcode</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences</code></strong> (or press <span class="emphasis"><em>com</em></span><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>mand </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span></strong></span>). From there, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Accounts</code></strong> button. This will display all of the Apple IDs that you want to be able to use in Xcode:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/71825ff7-7e64-41a7-b42b-57f98e04b318.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Click on the plus icon on the bottom left of the screen and then select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Apple ID</code></strong>. From the menu that pops up, go ahead and add in your Apple ID info and you should see it appear on the screen.</li></ol></div><p>If you select the name, you'll see additional info on the right side, such as what teams you are on. If you are not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program it'll just be a personal team, but if you are paying for it, you should see if there as well.</p></div>
