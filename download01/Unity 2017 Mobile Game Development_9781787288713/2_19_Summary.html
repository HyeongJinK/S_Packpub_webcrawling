You may find that certain things will slow down your device and make your game choppy. You may also find something that runs fine on your mobile device will slow down your computer. The thing is, you won't know unless you are always checking it out, so I highly advise that you do so.</p><p>Now that we have our game working on a mobile device right now, it currently will not react to anything we do due to how we wrote our input code. In the next chapter, we will explore how we can add input to our project as well as the design considerations to make in regards to how the different forms of input will change our game.</p></div>
