We first animated our menus with a few lines of code using Tweens from iTween and saw how a few lines of code can improve the visual quality of our UI in a number of ways. We then saw how to create materials to improve the visual quality of our ball and then used Post-Processing Effects to polish the contents of our screen. Finally, we discussed how to use particle effects to create a nice trail following our player.</p><p>By this point, our game is finally ready for the big leagues. In the next chapter, we will explore getting our game onto the App Store.</p></div>
