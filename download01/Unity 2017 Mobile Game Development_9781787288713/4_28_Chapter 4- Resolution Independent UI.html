Unlike when developing projects for PC, where you need to only care about a single resolution or aspect ratio, you should keep in mind that there are many different devices out there when building for mobile. For instance, we have phones, which fit in our pocket, but also tablets, which are huge. Not only that, but games can also be played horizontally or vertically.</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>) is the way that players interact with your games. You've actually been using a GUI in all of the previous chapters (the Unity Editor) and also when interacting with your operating system. Without a GUI of some sort, the only way you'd be able to interact with a computer is a command prompt, such as DOS or UNIX.</p><p>When working on GUIs, we want them to be as intuitive as possible and only contain the information that is pertinent to the player at any given time. There are people whose main job is programming and/or designing user interfaces, and there are college degrees on the subject as well. So, while we won't talk about everything that we have to work with using GUIs, I do want to touch on the aspects that should be quite helpful when working on your own projects in the future.</p><p>When building for mobile, it's very important that you design your UI to be resolution independent, or rather that the UI will scale and/or adjust itself to fit any screen size that is given to it. This will not only help us now, but also in the future.</p></div>
