Simple ads are easy to use, hence the name, and allow users to have simple full-screen interstitial ads. This can be really useful for moving between levels or perhaps for when the player wants to restart the game. Let's see how we can implement that <span>feature now.</span></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>To get started, it would be a good idea for us to have all of the Ad-related behavior to share a script, so we will create a new class called <code class="literal">UnityAdController</code> by going to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window, opening the <code class="literal">Assets/Scripts</code> folder, and selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>C# Script</code></strong>.</li><li>Open up the file in the IDE of your choice, and use the following code:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;

#if UNITY_ADS // Can only compile ad code on supported platforms 

using UnityEngine.Advertisements; // Advertisement class

#endif

public class UnityAdController : MonoBehaviour
{

    public static void ShowAd()
    {

        #if UNITY_ADS

        if (Advertisement.IsReady())
        {
            Advertisement.Show();
        }

        #endif

    }
}</pre><p>The preceding code does a number of things. We first state that we are using the <code class="literal">UnityEngine.Advertisments</code> namespace to get access to the <code class="literal">Advertisement</code> class.</p><p>We've also created a static method called <code class="literal">ShowAd</code>. We made this static so that we can access the function without actually having to create an instance of this class in order to call this function. We then check whether an advertisement is ready, and if it is, we will then call the <code class="literal">Show()</code> function to display it on the screen.</p><p>Note that in all of the code where we make use of the <code class="literal">Advertisement</code> class, I've added in a <code class="literal">#if</code> statement and closed it with a <code class="literal">#endif</code>. This is a directive that will only compile if the defined symbol is defined. Basically, this code will only be compiled if Unity supports ads on it, so our project will still compile for both PC and mobile devices.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on <code class="literal">#if</code><strong class="userinput"><code>,</code></strong><code class="literal">endif</code>, and other conditional directives, check out <a class="ulink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ew2hz0yd.aspx" target="_blank"><span>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ew2hz0yd.aspx</span></a>.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Save your script and then open up the <code class="literal">MainMenuBehaviour</code> file and add the following highlighted code:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;

    public void LoadLevel(string levelName)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(levelName);

<span class="strong"><strong>        }</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>#endif</strong></span>
    }
}</pre><p>This will have an advertisement play each time we call the <code class="literal">LoadLevel</code> function, if it is supported. We also added in a new parameter with a default value. The nice thing about this is that we can optionally decide when we want to show an ad. For instance, we may want to make it so that when we restart the game we don't play an ad.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Now let's see this in action. Play the game, pause the game, and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Menu</code></strong> button:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/c0e0d388-dc6a-4453-bf56-ea9478263727.png" /></div><p>As you can note in the preceding screenshot, the ad works correctly. This screen is what is shown when playing the game in the editor. It has buttons to allow us to test whether a player skips or watches a video in full. When we disable Test mode, we will then see live video ads.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note52"></a>Note</h3><p>If this does not work and/or show up, check the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings</code></strong> menu you learned about previously and ensure that your current platform is set to Android or iOS.</p></div></div>
