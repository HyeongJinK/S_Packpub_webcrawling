Are users skipping our tutorial? To keep track of how players go through a series of events, we have funnels. Funnels help us to identify where drop-offs happen in your game.</p><p>If you happen to see a large number of people not getting to a certain step, you can assume that something that happened in the preceding step is causing people to stop playing your game.</p><p>Funnels are based on the concept of custom events that we used in the previous two sections of this chapter:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>From the Dashboard, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Funnel Analyzer</code></strong> section:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/33afd57c-4b9f-4318-9cfd-a81575b537a7.png" /></div><p>Right now, there are no funnels set up, so we should create one.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>New Funnel</code></strong> option:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/934a1f33-1666-4fad-a694-1525c036d4c2.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Next, scroll all the way down and then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Save</code></strong> button:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/fc7c36fb-c07f-4e31-8b2e-7c8377f541d3.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>You'll get a notice saying that the funnel has been submitted, but it may take up to a day before we can see the results (at least 10-12 hours).
