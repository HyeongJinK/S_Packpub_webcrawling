Often, in the game industry, we will use playtesting--a method where selected people play the game, watch them, and then we use the feedback we receive to improve the project.</p><p>This playtesting is most often done in person; however, by creating games for mobile, a lot of people will be playing your game after release and most of them will have an internet connection. With this, we can send pieces of data about how the game is being played to ourselves. This will still allow us to do "playtesting" with a large variety of people. Being able to look at our data will allow us to check whether the choices that are made to change the game are the right ones, and we will be able to make adjustments to our games on the fly.</p><p>This could be something as simple as where the player dies in the game to things such as how often they come back to play, the daily average time they play, the number of users we have at a time, how long people play the game before stopping, and what choices they made.</p></div>
