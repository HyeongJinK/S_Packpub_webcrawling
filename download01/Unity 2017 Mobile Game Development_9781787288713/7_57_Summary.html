We started off by adding in a simple score system and then allowed others to share their score via Twitter. We then set up the Facebook SDK, making it so we can log into it to play our game and retrieve information about our users, which we can use to customize their gameplay experience.</p><p>Now that we have people playing our game, we may want to see what they're doing. Then, we can use that information to improve and/or tweak our game. In the next chapter, we will take a look at how we can do this using tools from Unity analytics.</p></div>
