With this enabled, your device can now install the <code class="literal">.apk</code> file, but now you will need to move your game over onto the device so that you can install it. The easiest way is to transfer it to your device via USB; we'll do that now.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"></a>Note</h3><p>For those of you who'd rather not use USB, I will sometimes use a cloud storage app, such as Dropbox, to upload my <code class="literal">.apk</code> file and then download it from the app and then install that way. There's also another tool called ADB, which can send files to your phone via USB or Wi-Fi. For more info on that and the rest of the Android build process, check out: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html</a>.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Connect your phone to your computer via USB.
