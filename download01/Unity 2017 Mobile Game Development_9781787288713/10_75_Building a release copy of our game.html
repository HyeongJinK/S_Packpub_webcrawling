You can check this by going into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings</code></strong> menu by navigating to <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings</code></strong>.</li><li>From there, you should see the Unity logo to the right of the Android or iOS selection. If you do not, select it and then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Switch Platform</code></strong> button and wait for it to finish reimporting the assets for the project:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/eb61e277-fb06-4b13-95df-daa52c9fbeab.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>After confirming we are building for Android or iOS, open up the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings</code></strong> menu by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings</code></strong> button from the menu or by going to <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong>.</li><li>If you haven't done so already, set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Company Name</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Product Name</code></strong> values to your own values. In my case, I used <code class="literal">John P. Doran</code> and <code class="literal">Endless Roller</code>, respectively.</li><li>You'll then see a <strong class="userinput"><code>Default Icon</code></strong> item. Drag and drop the <code class="literal">Hi-ResIcon</code> image into the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder and then drag and drop it into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Default Icon</code></strong> slot. This will cause the <strong class="userinput"><code>Icon</code></strong> section of the Android settings to automatically scale the image to fit whatever device you are targeting:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/adcca660-0c6a-4714-a1fa-9a78c793bc7d.png" /></div><p>Of course, you can also use your own image, and you can use transparency if you would like to.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Under the <strong class="userinput"><code>Resolution and Presentation</code></strong> section, you can enable or disable different rotations and aspect ratios as desired. We adjusted the game to fit <span>these</span>, but this may be useful to know about as you work on your own projects or you wish to restrict users to one experience or another.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Splash Screen</code></strong> option can be used to display your own logo in addition to Unity's if you have the <span>Personal edition of Unity</span>. If you have pro, you may disable it here.</li><li>Confirm under <strong class="userinput"><code>Other Settings</code></strong> that the <strong class="userinput"><code>Package Name</code></strong> property is not set to the default values. The general method of naming is <code class="literal">com.CompanyName.GameName</code>.</li><li>Next, open up <strong class="userinput"><code>Publishing Settings</code></strong>. This is where we are goin<span>g to be</span> putting in information about who our game's publisher is (in this case, I'm assuming it's you). Whenever you build a game for Android, you need a <strong class="userinput"><code>Keystore</code></strong>, which allows you to sign off on the game saying that you're allowed to build. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create a new keystore</code></strong> icon. Then, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Browse Keystore</code></strong> button and select a location for this file.</li></ol></div><p>Keep in mind where this is going to be located, as you will be using it in the future to create new versions of your game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/9a20aee1-6220-486a-bc62-bee9a1e3a396.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="10" type="1"><li>Then, you'll need to select a <strong class="userinput"><code>Keystore password</code></strong> textbox that you will need to know as you'll be using it over and over. Afterwards, in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Confirm keystore password</code></strong> text box, you should enter in the same thing as you did before.</li><li>Next, we will need to click on the dropdown under <strong class="userinput"><code>Key</code></strong> and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Create a new key</code></strong>. From there, you'll need to add in the same information as before: the password with confirmation and then your name and other information. You can see what I put down in the following screenshot. Once finished, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Key</code></strong> button:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/ed3b49d2-e5e3-4ef2-8766-cc78f5eca982.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="12" type="1"><li>Afterwards, from <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings</code></strong>, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Key</code></strong> dropdown again, and this time, select the keystore we created and then enter the password one more time:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/802c9830-0b10-4b36-9b1d-5ab527d3ec07.png" /></div><p>With that, we have everything set up that we need to put the game up on the store.</p></div>
