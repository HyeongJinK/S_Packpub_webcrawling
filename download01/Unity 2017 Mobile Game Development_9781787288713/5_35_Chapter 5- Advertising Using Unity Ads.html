Deciding on how to best sell a game can be difficult. Of course, you can sell your game for a price, and there is a possibility that it will be successful, but you'll be limiting your audience numbers to a much lower amount. This could work well for a niche game, but if you're trying to make a game with a broad appeal where <span>you want to get as many players as possible to play your title, you may have some issues</span>.</p><p>Having a price on the game can be a major hurdle in getting those initial customers who can share the game via word of mouth and contribute to having more people play your game. To solve this potential issue, you do have the option of making your game free. Afterward, you can give players the opportunity to purchase things or show advertisements when playing the project.</p><p>That's not to say that having a bunch of advertisements in a free game is the best option either. Having too many ads, or even the wrong kind of ads, can drive users away, which can be even worse. Many developers each have their own opinions on whether it's a good idea to use ads or not, but that's not the purpose of this chapter. In this chapter, we will look into different options available to us for advertising over the course of our game and show how to implement them, should you choose to add the content to your game.</p></div>
