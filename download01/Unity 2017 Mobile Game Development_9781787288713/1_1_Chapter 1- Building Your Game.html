Although there is a chance that you've already built a game and want to transition it to mobile, there will also be readers who haven't touched Unity before, or may have not used it in a long time. This chapter will act as an introduction to newcomers, a refresher for those coming back, and will provide some best practices for those who are already familiar with Unity.</p><p>In this chapter, we will build a 3-D endless runner game in the same vein as Imangi Studios, LLC's <span class="emphasis"><em>Temple Run</em></span> series. In our case, we will have a player who will run continuously in a certain direction, and will dodge obstacles that come in their way. We can also add additional features to the game easily, as the game will endlessly have new things added to it.</p></div>
