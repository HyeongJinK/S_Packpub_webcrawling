Unity Ads offers video ads that can be shown as either rewarded or non-rewarded placements. <span>Before we can enable Unity Ads, we must first enable Unity's Services suite</span>; so, let's do that first. To activate Unity Services, you have to link your project to a Unity Service Project ID, which is how Unity can tell the difference between the different projects you are creating.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Services</code></strong> window by going to <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Services</code></strong> or by clicking on the button that has a cloud on it in the toolbar on the right-hand side. If you are working offline, you may be asked to sign in. When you do so, you should see something similar to the following:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/31c20373-e6d1-4744-bcb0-7bb8c439355c.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Assuming that you haven't worked with Unity Services before, you will need to create an <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Organization</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Name</code></strong>.</span> Click on the dropdown and select your username and then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>The project name is automatically created according to the name of your project when you first created, but you can change this in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> section of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Services</code></strong> window.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note48"></a>Note</h3><p>Unity automatically creates an organization using your account username; however, if you need to make another one, you can do so at <span><a class="ulink" href="https://id.unity.com/organizations" target="_blank">https://id.unity.com/organizations</a>.</span></p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/77b2d932-2978-4351-a3e4-e358e98c25a4.png" /></div><p>This should open up the <strong class="userinput"><code>Services</code></strong> window which contains a number of sections that we will be using over the course of this book.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>At the top of the menu that pops up, <span>you</span>'ll see a button called <strong class="userinput"><code>Ads</code></strong>.

Behavioral targeting can yield higher <span class="strong"><strong>effective cost per thousand impressions</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>eCPMs</strong></span>) by showing ads that are more relevant to your users, but its use is prohibited with users under the age of 13 due to <span class="strong"><strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule Act</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>COPPA</strong></span>) regulations.

If they are to click on or install any of the advertised games, their activity will be monetized and the automated fraud system would flag the game for fraud and disable it. That's why we keep Test mode enabled until the game is ready to launch.</p></div><p>At this point, we have finished setup and can proceed to actually adding ads to our project.</p></div>
