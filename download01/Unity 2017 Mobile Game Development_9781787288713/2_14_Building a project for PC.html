Just to verify that everything is working correctly, let's go ahead and get the game working on our own platform before moving to mobile:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>To get started, we will select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong> option. In my instance, I'll be ex<span>porting</span> our project to Windows, but the process is similar for Mac and Linux.</li><li>Once this is done, a window will pop up asking for a name and a location to put the game in. I'm going to name it <code class="literal">Endless</code> and put it in a new <code class="literal">Export</code> folder located in the same folder that contains <code class="literal">Assets</code> and <code class="literal">Library</code>, so it won't show up in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window, but it will be in the same folder as my project:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/42900524-e235-40ab-ab3c-2f2798c24857.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Save</code></strong> and wait for it to finish.

You must include the data folder with your game, or it will not run.</p><p>If you build for Mac, it will bundle the app and data all together, so once you export it, all you need to provide is the application.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>If you double-click on the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file to run the game, you'll be taken to the following startup menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/e3497a8e-bb45-4e6e-b03b-e6fa7e856352.png" /></div><p>This will allow players to customize their <strong class="userinput"><code>Screen resolution</code></strong> values as well as other options, such as what buttons to use for input.
