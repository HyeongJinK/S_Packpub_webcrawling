<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch09lvl1sec62"></a>Using post-processing effects</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>One of the ways that we can improve the visual quality of our game with little effort is using post-processing effects (previously called <strong class="userinput"><code>Image Effects</code></strong>). Post-processing is the process of applying filters and other effects to what the camera will draw (the image buffer) before it is displayed on the screen.</p><p>Unity includes a number of effects in its freely available post-processing stack, so let's go ahead and add it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open up the <strong class="userinput"><code>Asset Stor</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong> again, and search for <code class="literal">Post Processing Stack</code> this time:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/0bb0b532-f625-4f6e-9d2c-8654406f8acd.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Select to <strong class="userinput"><code>Download</code></strong> it, and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Accept</code></strong> button when it asks you to. Once it's finished, go ahead and import the contents into our project.</li><li>Switch to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> window, and then from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> window, select our <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> object and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong> in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> and type in <code class="literal">PostProcessing</code>; then move your mouse over the <strong class="userinput"><code>Post Processing Behaviour</code></strong> selection and then click to add the script to your project.</li></ol></div><p>Note that this component requires a profile. We can go ahead and add that next.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>We can create a new post-processing <strong class="userinput"><code>Profile</code></strong> by right-clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window, selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Post Processing Profile</code></strong>, and naming it <code class="literal">MobilePostProcessing</code>:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/89669369-faca-427e-89ff-4a9973acf70b.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Attach this object to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Profile</code></strong> property of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Post Processing Behaviour</code></strong> component on the camera and then start the game and pause it.
Now, there's a large number of possible effects that can be added to modify how the game looks. Note that for each one you add, the frame rate of the devices we are trying to run our game on will be decreased<span>. Keep testing your device with these options and note how it works.</span></li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> view and then select the <code class="literal">MobilePostProcessing</code> profile. To start off, toggle the <strong class="userinput"><code>Vignette</code></strong> property. Note how now there seems to be a blackened edge around the game. We will increase the <strong class="userinput"><code>Smoothness</code></strong> to <code class="literal">0.35</code> to make it even darker by clicking on the top right of the section to expand it:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/3066a252-5888-4537-bb4a-fd090d9b6c2d.png" /></div><p>Vignetting is the term used for the darkening and/or desaturating toward the edges of an image compared to the center. I like to use this when I want to have players focus on the center of the screen.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Next, check the Antialiasing option.</li></ol></div><p>Aliasing is an effect where lines appear jagged on the screen. This happens if the display we are trying to play our game on doesn't have a high enough resolution to display properly. Anti-aliasing attempts to reduce that appearance by attempting to combine colors nearby these lines to remove the prominence at the cost of it appearing blurrier.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Toggle <strong class="userinput"><code>Grain</code></strong>, and you'll note that the screen has become a lot fuzzier. While not a great idea at the default size, decreasing the size to <code class="literal">.1</code>, unchecking colored, and decreasing the intensity to <code class="literal">.15</code> will help with the appearance of things:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/649d3abf-6eec-49ae-b6de-d9df0986ccc2.png" /></div><p>If you've been to a movie theater that still uses film, you may have noticed how there were little specks of things in the filmstock while playing over time. The grain effect simulates this film-grain, causing the effect to become more pronounced the more the movie is played. This is often used in horror games to obscure the player's vision.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>Another property to check is <strong class="userinput"><code>Bloom</code></strong>, which makes bright things even brighter. Decreasing the <strong class="userinput"><code>Threshold</code></strong> to <code class="literal">.75</code> and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Soft Knee</code></strong> to <code class="literal">.1</code> will help brighten things up:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787288713/graphics/98260c91-32d7-41f9-9b26-dd7bdd4cf988.png" /></div><p>Bloom attempts to mimic the imaging artifacts of real-world cameras, where things in areas with light will glow along the edges, thus overwhelming the camera. There are a number of other properties to look into and adapt your project to look just the way you want it.
