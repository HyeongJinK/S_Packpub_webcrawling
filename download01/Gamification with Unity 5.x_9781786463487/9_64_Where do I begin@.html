That way, even if your development process takes time, people are reminded about the awesome work that you are doing. Short posts about what you're up to, or an image during the development process, are all enough to maintain interest, but not to indefinitely keep it. Make sure that you have more detailed updates along the way so that there is a bit more context about what you and your team have been up to.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec118"></a>Long-term</h3></div></div></div><p>Create a timeline, such as in the following figure, from when you begin developing to when you will be finished. Ideally, you should already have a timeline, but if you don't, create one. In this timeline, include all the different stages, for example, iterations, testing, and so on, and approximate dates. Now, with this <span class="emphasis"><em>timeline</em></span>, brainstorm some ideas for blog posts and articles. This is only a tentative list, because as the game develops, so too will ideas for posts. Now, once you are done, put it somewhere safe and remember to keep iterating it. As you begin to approach each section of the timeline, start to write your articles. If they can be done in advance, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>meet the team</em></span>-type ones, then start early. By doing this, you will always have content to share and won't have to stay up all night writing blog posts:</p><p>

</p><p>Another useful thing to have is a <span class="emphasis"><em>press kit</em></span>. Think of this as an overview of your project along with accompanying material, such as logos and images, that will be used by the public (without any copyright issues) to promote your game. By having these things available, you ensure that, wherever your content is being distributed, they have high quality material and the right facts. It's also a good reference point when you need to quickly send a summary of your project.</p><p>Another thing is to always engage with your audience, ask them questions, ask for their feedback, and get them involved and caring about your game. Games need players, and we as game designers want players to be a part of the experience. People are curious about what goes on <span class="emphasis"><em>behind the scenes</em></span>.</p></div></div>
