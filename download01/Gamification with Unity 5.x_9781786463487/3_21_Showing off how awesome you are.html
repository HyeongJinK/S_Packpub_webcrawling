<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec24"></a>Showing off how awesome you are</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>What's the point of having achievements without showing them off? Maybe you want to feel like you have accomplished something after a long day of work, or maybe you just want to show off your shiny new badges to your friends. That is why we will be creating a profile page with our achievements included. The basic screen that we will have after this section looks like the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_020.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The Achievement page</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec29"></a>Badges, badges, badges</h3></div></div></div><p>Now it is time to implement some badges that are based on the player's achievements. An example of what the finished product will look like can be seen in the following screenshot. For now, we will be using the icons from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.player26.com" target="_blank">www.player26.com</a>, but feel free to use any other images that you may have:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_021.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Completed badge part of the application, featuring (left) the unlocked version and (right) the locked version</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"></a>Achievement unlocked!</h3></div></div></div><p>Items that are locked can create a mystery about what they actually contain. Do they have some rare item, lots of gold, or maybe it's something exclusive to a particular thing? As humans, we are curious, and unlockables can drive that curiosity. In some cases, trying to figure out <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to unlock whatever is hidden can drive us mad:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_022.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Examples of other unlockable icons</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"></a>Implementing an achievement system</h3></div></div></div><p>The first thing to do is to create a new image component in Unity. As we did for the profile picture in the previous chapter, it must be full-screen. We can use the <code class="literal">achievements_page</code> in our package. It's always useful to give meaningful names to all the game objects we create. For instance, we can rename it <code class="literal">Achievements Page</code>. This is the result:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_023.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The Achievement Page without any achievements</p><p>Now, we need to create another image using <code class="literal">epic_clicker_greyscale</code> from our package. For the same reasons as before, name it <code class="literal">Achievement_1</code>. We need to both scale it to fit the first space in the <code class="literal">Achievements Page</code> and parent it to the <code class="literal">Achievements Page</code>. So, at the end we will have something like the following:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_024.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The achievements page with the first achievement (in its locked state)</p><p>Create a new script attached to <code class="literal">Achievement_1</code> and name it <code class="literal">AchievementScript</code>.</p><p>As we have already done previously for some of the earlier scripts, we need to import the library that contains the UI classes. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of our script:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine.UI; &#13;
</pre><p>We need to add three variables, two for storing the reference to both the locked and the unlocked sprites, and the third for the reference to the image component. So we can add the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">    private Sprite lockedSprite; &#13;
    public Sprite unlockedSprite; &#13;
    private Image uiImage; &#13;
</pre><p>Then, in the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function, we need to get the reference to the image component and the locked Sprite:</p><pre class="programlisting">  void Start () { &#13;
        uiImage = GetComponent&lt;Image&gt;(); &#13;
        lockedSprite = uiImage.sprite; &#13;
  } &#13;
</pre><p>Finally, we need to create a couple of functions to unlock and to lock again (if needed, for instance, to reset the achievements). We just assign the new (or old) Sprite to the image component as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">  public void unlockAchievement() { &#13;
        uiImage.sprite = unlockedSprite; &#13;
    } &#13;
 &#13;
    public void lockAchievement() { &#13;
        uiImage.sprite = lockedSprite; &#13;
    } &#13;
</pre><p>Now, save the script.</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, we need to assign the unlocked Sprite. We can drag <code class="literal">epic_clicker_coloured</code> from our package into the <code class="literal">unlockedSprite</code> variable, as in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_025.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The image component along the achievement script with the variable filled</p><p>Next, we can trigger the achievement to unlock it. Once it is unlocked, it will look like the following:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_026.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The achievements page with the first achievement (in its unlocked state)</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec18"></a>Example of usage</h4></div></div></div><p>This section will show a simple case of using the script that we have created before.</p><p>Let's create a new button. In its <span class="strong"><strong>On Click ()</strong></span> tab, create a new event and bring <code class="literal">Achievement_01</code> into the <code class="literal">Object</code> variable. From the drop-down menu, let's choose <span class="strong"><strong>AchievementScript</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>unlockAchievement()</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_027.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The button component with the event to trigger the unlocking of the achievement</p><p>As a result, when the user clicks on the button, the achievement will be unlocked. Of course, this will work much better if we include a visual or an audio feedback, as we have already discussed.</p><p>Getting badges, points, and progressing in a gamified experience should all be displayed somewhere. We need a nice place, to display our trophies and to reflect on all that we have accomplished, so far. Dashboards are a great way to achieve this. Not only do they provide summaries of your overall experience, but they are great to way to really feel as though you have accomplished something, and to see where you need to head next, albeit unlocking achievements or progressing to the next level. Just like many things, dashboards can be as complex or as simple as the designer wants to make them, but remember that they need to be meaningful. It should not only be about what you want to show to the player, such as their progress, but also why you want to show it.</p></div></div></div>
