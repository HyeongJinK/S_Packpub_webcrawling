<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec51"></a>Playtesting</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>This is one of the most important parts of your game design. In fact, you cannot expect to have a great game without it. Playtesting is not just about seeing if your game works, or if there are bugs; it is also about finding out what people really think about it before you put it out there for the world to see. In some cases, playtesting can be the difference between succeeding or failing epically. Consider this scenario: you have spent the last year, blood, sweat, and tears, even your soul, creating something fantastic. You probably think it's the best thing out there. Then, after you release it, you realize that only half the game was balanced, or worse, half interesting. At this stage, you are going to feel pretty down, but all this could have been avoided if you had taken the time to get some feedback. As humans, we don't necessarily like to hear our greatest loves being criticized, especially if we have committed so much of our lives to it. But the thing to keep in mind is that this stage shapes the final details.</p><p>Playtesting is not meant for the final stages, when your game is close to being finished. At each stage, even once you begin to get a basic prototype completed, it should be playtested. During these stages, it does not have to be large-scale testing; it can be a few colleagues, friends, or even family giving you an idea of whether or not you're heading in the right direction. The main thing here is to really stress that you need honest feedback, even if it's perhaps not something you want to hear. Of course, the other important thing to keep in mind is that the people who are testing your game are as close as possible to, if not <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>, target audience. For instance, imagine that you're creating a gamified application to encourage people to take medication on a regular basis. It is not ideal to test it with people who do not take medication. Sure, they may be able to give general feedback, such as UI elements or even interaction, but in terms of its effectiveness, you're better off taking the time to recruit more specific people.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec91"></a>Methods of playtesting</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different ways to approach the playtesting phase. There is no right or wrong way to go about it. However, there are some things that need to be considered and included during the playtesting phase. Playtesting can be done by oneself, and it can also be done with others. Ideally, having people who are from your target audience is the preferred place to start. However, we will also look at how to get valuable information, when your playtesters aren't from your target group.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec34"></a>Going solo</h4></div></div></div><p>This might seem like an obvious thing, but even if you think you have developed the Holy Grail of playtesting criteria, it is more than likely you've forgotten something. This is why it is important that you playtest with yourself or your team. It is even worthwhile to playtest with a small group of others before rolling out a larger-scale playtesting session. Not only does this show you how you want to test the application, it will also help you to shape and focus your questions about their experience, whether it is a verbal discussion or a survey.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec35"></a>Group testing</h4></div></div></div><p>The more the merrier, and it's the same with is playtesting. When you have group testing, it is important to not only have people from your target demographic, but other people as well. This is because they may be able to offer valuable feedback from a different perspective.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec36"></a>Open or controlled</h4></div></div></div><p>This is the same question as asking whether your playtest is going to be public or private. Do players need to sign a non-disclosure agreement, or can they freely and openly talk about the game to anyone after they have played? This is a very important consideration, because if you want to keep the contents of your game private until release, you don't want people posting about it on Facebook. Other considerations can be asking playtesters not to take any videos or pictures during testing. In some cases, especially for online games, the <span class="strong"><strong>Print Screen</strong></span> option is disabled. While there are many workarounds to this, by getting participants to adhere to a set of rules prior to playtesting (for example, signing an agreement), you can avoid any unwanted publicity later.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec37"></a>Getting the info - have a plan!</h4></div></div></div><p>Testing is fine, but without an objective, it is redundant. Ask yourself questions such as: What am I hoping to get from playtesting my game or application? Am I trying to find out if a particular part of the application works in a certain way, or if the application is interesting as a whole? Playtesting can be as simple as focusing on one of these things, or as complex as focusing on all of them. Of course, the latter would require different approaches, and even segmenting your playtesting group to focus on each element. Ideally, though, you want to make sure that important features are tested, not trivial ones.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec92"></a>Recruiting the chosen ones!</h3></div></div></div><p>So now, you have <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> you're going to playtest; the next step is to find <span class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span>. These people can range from those that you know, don't know, people within physical proximity (for example, testing in a physical location), or virtual testing (for example, testing over a distance using downloads). The other thing to keep in mind is who you want playing your game and whether or not they will be the ones who <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> play your game in the end. Getting feedback from a group of school children for an application that is aimed at finance management is not going to give you the insights or data that you're looking for. While in some cases you might be limited to who you can get to test your game, try to get testers within your demographic. If you can't, then it's about asking the questions that will give you valuable information to improve the application for those who will play it.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec38"></a>People you know</h4></div></div></div><p>You can always start with your friends, family, and other close associates if you want to get some quick feedback about a particular part of your application, or even as a second pair of eyes along the way.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec39"></a>People you don't know</h4></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, it's great to get comments from those that we know. This is because we feel comfortable with them, and in some instances they tell us what we want to hear, which is counterintuitive.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip33"></a>Tip</h3><p>Once you get some basic feedback from those that you know, get the opinion of those you don't.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec40"></a>The people who you are targeting</h4></div></div></div><p>Given all this talk about people, it is important to keep in mind <span class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span> you are intending your game or application to be for. Perhaps this is in the very early stages and you're still trying to figure out if it's for a specific age range or for everyone. In any event, put together a <span class="emphasis"><em>user profile</em></span> of the kinds of attribute that they may have. This will also help you to improve the design for your playtest. In this way, you are able to focus questions that are related to the relevance of the application to them and find out (if necessary) what could make it more relevant.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec93"></a>Setting up the play-date for playtesting</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that you have decided <span class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span> will be a part of your playtest, you still need to figure out <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span>. Then you need to ask yourself some basic questions, such as Do I need a large space to playtest in? Can playtesters bring their own devices, or will you supply them with one?</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec41"></a>A little goes a long way</h4></div></div></div><p>Will you be compensating your playtesters in any way? One thing to consider if you have limited funds is buying some snacks or drinks to supply them with during testing. If it is a long time, if they are giving up their time to help you out, it is nice to give something back to say thank you.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec42"></a>Getting everyone on the same page</h4></div></div></div><p>You will need to get everyone up-to-speed, and the best way to do this is to give a brief introduction to what you will be doing. You can do this in any number of ways, such as a small presentation or even a handout explaining the game/application and the purpose of the playtesting. It doesn't matter which way you do it, as long as it brings everyone up-to-date about the point of them coming.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec43"></a>Play time!</h4></div></div></div><p>Now that everyone knows the details of what they are required to do, it's time to actually do it. There is no particular strategy to get users testing. For example, you may want users to play within the same room, isolated, with or without headphones, and so forth. These factors are entirely up to you because, ideally, it comes back to what kind of information you are looking to gain. If one element that you're focusing on is the audio effects during gameplay, then it would be better for participants to use headphones. Perhaps it is a social game in which you want players to interact with each other; in this case, the space should be designed to facilitate that. Do you need tables, chairs, perhaps have some music in the background to break the formality and create a relaxed atmosphere? These are some important things to keep in mind when you're choosing and designing the space for playtesting. It can also be things like this that affect a playtester's mood as well. Being kept in a small room, with no open windows for a couple of hours with 12 other people may not be the most pleasant experience; they will probably want to finish quickly and leave.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the duration of the playtest. For example, you may need an application to be tested over a 5, 10, or even 30-day period to really determine if it achieves what you want it to, or at least part of it. Therefore, you need to consider if, in these instances, playtesters need to come to a specific place to engage (if so, are you able to compensate them?) or they are able to playtest from the comfort of their home.</p></div></div></div>
