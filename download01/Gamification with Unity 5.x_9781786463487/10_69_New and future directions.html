Of course, remember that gamified applications and approaches don't always have to be digital, and they shouldn't just be about badges, points, and rewards. A gamified experience should be considered as a complementary resource, something that gives you that extra kick when you really just can't be bothered, not something that is relied upon.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec128"></a>Uses within education</h3></div></div></div><p>Using gamification in education is a topic with many different opinions, which would require an entire book or two to cover. However, you can use what you have learned in the book and apply it within an educational context. Some examples are listed in the following section, but I encourage you to explore what others have done throughout the world and be inspired.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec68"></a>Homework management</h4></div></div></div><p>Kids don't generally like homework unless there is something that they find interesting about it. Some ideas that you could use are to allow children to set tasks, or to choose from a list of predefined ones and then complete them. For example, if they have biology homework that needs to be completed, get them to break it down into chunks, and if they complete it all within a certain time frame, they can go to the movies or maybe get that toy that they always wanted. If you want to spice things up a bit, you can always add a narrative or quests to give a bit more meaning to what they have to do. Maybe slay the <span class="emphasis"><em>mitosis demon</em></span> by completing related homework.</p><p>Other ideas also include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Reading assignments (for example, chapter by chapter towards a badge, or reward)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Studying for tests</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Getting good grades</p></li></ul></div><p>There are a number of classroom activities that don't have to involve anything digital, and you can use to get your students a bit more engaged with lesson content. The following are a few ideas for you to try out within your classroom.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec129"></a>Who wants to be a knowledge-aire?</h3></div></div></div><p>We have all seen the shows where someone is placed in a seat and faced with a question and four possible options. In most cases, they have a few ways to get assistance such as <span class="emphasis"><em>phone a friend</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>50/50</em></span>, and so on. Therefore, why not bring the same concept into the classroom? While classroom tests will still exist, this is an exciting way to get not only students involved in learning the content, but also producing it.</p><p>For example, for a class homework assignment, ask each student to write down a question with four possible answers about the current topic. This can be anything from a mathematics equation to a character from a play that is being studied. Students can e-mail them to you, bring them to class, and so on. However, the main thing is that they are also checked beforehand to make sure that they are correct. Once everything is sorted, randomly choose a student; you can do this by having them write their names on a piece of paper and <span class="emphasis"><em>pull one out of the hat</em></span>. Then, they have to try and answer as many questions as possible within a time limit. You can implement options such as to <span class="emphasis"><em>ask a friend</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>50/50</em></span>. The main thing to reinforce is that it is meant to be fun.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec130"></a>Hide and seek</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, content can be really boring, but one way to mix it up a bit is to give students something to search for. Example 1: if students have to read passages from a play, then create a quest for them such as deciphering a cryptic clue.</p><p>Example 2: if they are reading about trigonometry, perhaps the first number of each answer is part of the <span class="emphasis"><em>secret</em></span> combination that the professor needs to free the triangles from an inevitable fate! Try to avoid getting them to search for simple things such as <span class="emphasis"><em>the second word from paragraph 4 on page 21</em></span>. This will not encourage them to learn the content but to focus on the game, and the game is only a complementary component. Instead, you could still get them to find a particular word, but in a more indirect way. For example, the answer to question <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> reveals the page number, the answer to <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> reveals the number for the paragraph, and the answer to <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> reveals the number for word, and so on.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec131"></a>The ultimate race</h3></div></div></div><p>To create a year-long challenge, you can get students to compete for a <span class="emphasis"><em>mystery prize</em></span>; what that prize is, in the end, is up to you. Each lesson is a part of this race, and at any moment, a classroom task or homework assignment that is assessed could be contributing to this race. Ideally, each task that is included in this race contributes to it somehow. For example, one task may be worth five points: one point for starting it, two points for getting it right, and two points for finishing it. You could represent this race like a board game where students know when certain things will happen. However, to avoid them trying to game the system, the unknown creates much more excitement! Now, along the way, there must be something in place that determines the <span class="emphasis"><em>winner</em></span>. This can be an <span class="emphasis"><em>elimination round</em></span> where students are pressed against the time to answer as many questions as possible, or they could be eliminated for bad behavior, or something else. In reverse, students could be given additional points for arriving in class on time and good behavior.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec132"></a>Uses within business</h3></div></div></div><p>A business context has many layers; you have your own day-to-day tasks as well as group/project-related ones. Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming, and as a result, stress and anxiety levels increase. One way to add a bit more <span class="emphasis"><em>life</em></span> to some otherwise mundane tasks.</p><p>Other ideas also include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Productivity</strong></span>: This can include anything from meeting deadlines to submitting reports on time. One of the key areas to identify when creating a gamified experience to encourage productivity is why it's becoming an issue in the first place. If it is something to do with the work environment, creating a reward scheme isn't going to solve the problem. A few examples of productivity applications include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Habit RPG (as already discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Anatomy of Games</em></span>): <a class="ulink" href="http://www.habitrpg.com" target="_blank">www.habitrpg.com</a>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mind Bloom: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mindbloom.com" target="_blank">www.mindbloom.com</a>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Time Tune: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.timetune.center" target="_blank">www.timetune.center</a>
</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Punctuality/efficiency</strong></span>: <span class="emphasis"><em>Time is money</em></span>, and if you can reduce the time that it takes to do something, such as arriving at work or completing a project, you are likely to reap more benefits in the long run. However, again, like productivity, the key is to identify the issues causing a lack of promptness and to find ways to  prevent it. Of course, we all like a pat on the back once in a while, and a gamified application can certainly achieve that!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Managing workloads</strong></span>: Especially during busy times of the year such as the holiday season, we can be inundated with last-minute requests to get projects completed on time without them having to eat into our vacation time. One way is to create Gantt charts, but where is the fun in that? Finding creative ways to manage sometimes overwhelming workloads can be the key to keeping stress levels down, or at least reducing them.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Team management</strong></span>: We all remember that project in school where we worked as part of the team, but ended up doing it ourselves...well, perhaps for the most part. Sometimes it can be difficult to work with people in a team, especially if you have opposing opinions, different lifestyles, all of which can impact a team's ability to work effectively. Therefore, incorporating a bit of playfulness can be a great way to break down any issues. An example of a team management related-application is Asana (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.asana.com" target="_blank">www.asana.com</a>).</p></li></ul></div><p>However, just like work, our own lives away from the office can also benefit from gamified experiences. The following is a brief discussion about some other sub-contexts of personal uses for gamified applications.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec133"></a>Uses within personal life</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different parts of our lives that we have working as they should, and then there are others that we could use a bit of help with. Not everything is an experience that we may necessarily want to share with others; sometimes the urge to make the changes that we need to feel happy with ourselves, and with our lives in general, comes from within. These types of change include being healthier, fitter, more productive, and also better at organizing our lives so that we actually have one without it being overcome by work. Here is a list of different areas that gamified applications can be used for within our personal lives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Increasing healthier habits</strong></span>: When <span class="emphasis"><em>one more donut</em></span> ended up being two or sometimes three, we could have made a better choice. But it's hard, and anyone who has made an attempt to stay on the healthy path knows that delicious cakes and tasty fried food takes us down the dark path of temptation to satisfy our taste buds. However, <span class="emphasis"><em>where there is a will there is a way</em></span>, and being conscious about what we do (or shouldn't do but end up doing anyway) can help us make better decisions. Sometimes all it takes is a few extra points for eating less, a positive message after losing those extra five kilos, to make all the difference. Some examples of fitness-related applications include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Zombies, Run! (as discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Anatomy of Games</em></span>): <a class="ulink" href="http://www.zombiesrungame.com" target="_blank">www.zombiesrungame.com</a>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Lifesum:<a class="ulink" href="http://wwww.lifesum.com" target="_blank">wwww.lifesum.com</a>
</p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Maintaining a work/life balance</strong></span>: It's the difference between having a hobby that is flying a kite, or crunching numbers on a weekend for the annual financial report, while everyone is at the beach. Drawing the line between work and life can be hard, especially if you work from home, or your job is unpredictable. However, it is possible to manage it all, at least in some way so we can allow ourselves some time to relax. Notifications that remind us to take a break, to go out and get some fresh air, perhaps even walk the dog, can all help us to break away from it all. Perhaps you want to begin yoga, or learn to surf; scheduling our lives is one way to go about it, but rewarding your efforts (100 points for placing yourself first!) for not bringing your work home can help you to leave some time for you and your family. An example of a work/life balance related application is <span class="strong"><strong>Atracker</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wonderapps.se" target="_blank">www.wonderapps.se</a>).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reducing bad habits</strong></span>: We all succumb to something that we could make a better choice about, such as smoking, drinking soda every day, or not being as nice as we could. Therefore, why not try to encourage ourselves to make better choices, whether it's for ourselves, a loved one, or our family and friends. Sometimes, having a social support network that you can turn to for support, or compete against, can be enough to break the threshold and start the path to better habits. An example of a habit-related application is BreakFree (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.breakfree-app.com" target="_blank">www.breakfree-app.com</a>).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chore/responsibility management</strong></span>: Kids don't like chores...well, neither do adults. I love doing the washing, said no one ever, even though it's nice to have clean clothes. However, it is laborious, tedious, and a pain when you come home after working all day to find a sink full of dirty dishes that you said you would take care of yesterday. Therefore, gamified applications can at least make some part of the whole process fun. It's even possible to encourage a bit of healthy completion among members of the family or roommates, if there is a prize at stake! An example of a chore-related application is Chore Wars (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.chorewars.com" target="_blank">www.chorewars.com</a>).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Managing finances/taxes</strong></span>: Nobody likes to do them (except for maybe accountants!), but we do like the tax return. So why, knowing that do we still struggle to do them? Well, they are boring, take a lot of concentration (if you do them yourself), and also require a bit of effort to keep things, such as receipts and invoices, organized throughout the year. Therefore, why not make a deal with yourself, or the application, that if you file it on time, even earlier than anticipated, you can indulge yourself a little. Perhaps you were bargaining with yourself whether or not to buy that pair of shoes, or that sound system that you have been eyeing all year; well, now's the chance! An example of a finance-related application is Smarty Pig (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.smartypig.com" target="_blank">www.smartypig.com</a>).</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, all of the applications previously mentioned are just suggested examples, and are not necessarily designed for that specific context. Therefore, take the time to check them out, and to also do a bit of research for yourself to find an application that works for you and can help you get to where you need to be.</p></div></div>
