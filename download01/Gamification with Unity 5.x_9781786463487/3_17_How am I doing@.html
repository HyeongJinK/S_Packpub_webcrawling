Just like being in school, if you did a test, you were given feedback such as a mark or a <span class="emphasis"><em>Fantastic</em></span> written next to your result. In other cases, if you did something wrong, you will have probably heard your name being called out by the teacher. In this example, you will learn how to create two types of feedback: visual and audio. In addition, feedback can be given in real-time or can be given at the end of an event. When, where, and how the player gets their feedback, depends on what you as a designer are trying (to get the player) to achieve.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec24"></a>Keeping it visual</h3></div></div></div><p>To create visual feedback within Unity, we need to display a screen to the player. It can contain both a congratulations screen or a retry one. Whatever your feedback is, the way to implement it within Unity is always the same.</p><p>Let's start by creating a new image in Unity. Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span>. We can rename it <code class="literal">Visual Feedback Screen</code>. As a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span>, we can use <code class="literal">feedback_pos_screen</code> or <code class="literal">feedback_neg_screen</code>. Also, we can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Set Native Size</strong></span> button, giving its original dimensions before scaling it down. If we have created a positive screen, we should have something like the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>A positive feedback screen</p><p>And if we chose to have a negative one, it should look something like the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>A negative feedback window</p><p>Now, we need to add a button that will let the user close the screen by tapping on it. During the creation of the button, we can parent it to <code class="literal">Visual Feedback Screen</code> if we right-click on it and then go to <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Button</strong></span>. Similarly to what we did for buttons in the previous chapter, we need to set the <span class="strong"><strong>Transition</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span>, and to erase the text by leaving only the button. Furthermore, we need to set the alpha channel of the image component to zero and to make the button as big as the screen (or any size that you prefer, and that suits your design!)</p><p>In its <span class="strong"><strong>OnClick()</strong></span> tab, we need to add an event. Drag the <code class="literal">Visual Feedback Screen</code> into the <code class="literal">Object</code> variable. Then, select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>.<span class="strong"><strong>SetActive</strong></span> and uncheck the box, like in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_03_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The Button component after we have added the event</p><p>As a result, clicking on the button will make the screen disappear.</p><p>The next step is to make it appear when an event is triggered. So, in the script where we want to trigger the screen, we need to add a public variable that shows where to get the reference to the <code class="literal">Visual Feedback Screen</code>, like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">public GameObject feedbackScreen; &#13;
</pre><p>Then, when we want to trigger it, we can add the following line:</p><pre class="programlisting">feedbackScreen.SetActive(true); &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you are now able to trigger a visual feedback screen in your code.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec25"></a>What's that noise?</h3></div></div></div><p>Humans have five senses (some may even have a sixth!), so why not tap into one: audio! Audio feedback is even easier to implement within Unity. Instead of creating an entire framework to play sounds, which could make sense if we need to have much more control over the audio, let's just implement a couple of lines of code. In fact, every time we need to have audio feedback, we can create a variable in the script where we want to have the feedback. It stores the audio clip that will be played, like so:</p><pre class="programlisting">public AudioClip audioFeedback; &#13;
</pre><p>Then, when we need to trigger the audio feedback, add this line of code:</p><pre class="programlisting">AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(audioFeedback, Input.mousePosition); &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, we will have audio feedback. Of course, don't forget to set the variable with the clip in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
