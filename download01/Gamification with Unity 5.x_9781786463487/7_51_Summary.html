In fact, all the main logic has been implemented. The user is now able to visualize the tasks in a nice and ordered way. Furthermore, he or she is able to mark them as completed and eventually remove them. Plus, the user can create new tasks with a form. In addition, he or she can navigate through the application with a lateral menu. I'd say that, so far, we have achieved a lot! However, our application is not finished, because we still need to refine it. In saying that, now it is time to get ready to immerse yourself in the next chapter, where we will learn how to playtest our creation!</p></div>
