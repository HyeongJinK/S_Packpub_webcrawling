</p><p>So, I invite you to create your own graphics by revisiting the previous chapter, which covered some basics in Adobe Illustrator. In any case, if you don't have time, or for any other reason you don't want to, you can always download all the graphics for this book from <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com" target="_blank">player26.com</a>. Again, using your own graphics gives an additional personal touch.</p></div>
