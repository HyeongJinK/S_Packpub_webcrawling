Understanding the Player  </h2></div></div></div><p>There are approximately 7.125 billion humans on planet Earth. Each gaming experience that we design is for a small subset of these people. However, in a world with so many people it can be a daunting task when you need to design a game for any particular audience. With that said, we have a lot in common. We like and dislike similar things, even if they are for different reasons. We have consistent patterns of behavior, which have been observed both in reality (such as personality typologies) and in gaming experiences (for example, player typologies). So that you can get a better understanding about who you will be designing for, this chapter will explore the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin,<span class="emphasis"><em> The players - who are they and where are they from?</em></span>, will discuss information that relates to who we are, who our audiences are, and how this all relates back to the design of our game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>Who our application is targeting</em></span>, looks at how to refine our concept so that it becomes more focused around our target audience. What are the aims, objectives, and outcomes? We will discuss important things that we need to consider and how they can influence the overall design of your game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>This section, <span class="emphasis"><em>The user</em></span>, explains how to implement basic, but foundational user features into our application such as a profile page, an avatar, and some basic player information.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Before we reach the end of our chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deciding on what you want your users to achieve</em></span> then covers how to set aims and objectives for your players to achieve during the gamified experience.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a user profile system in Unity</em></span>, will teach us how to create an achievement page that will come in useful later on in this book. This section will provide an overview, to both the player and to anyone who can view their profile of the achievements that they have obtained and that they are still yet to receive.</p></li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you should have a foundation about the different characteristics of players and how they are engaged. This will be useful information when we come to the design part of the project part of this book.</p></div>
