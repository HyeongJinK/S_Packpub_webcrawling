So how can we gamify all these ideas? In this chapter, the reader will learn how to design a gamified application before starting to create a final version. The reader will learn different and specific techniques  for the creation of gamified applications in different contexts, allowing the reader to have more tools to face the challenge. Furthermore, you'll also learn how to use Unity during the process to help the reader to create helpful tools in Unity to generate new ideas. Here's a list of topics that we'll cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin,<span class="emphasis"><em> Brainstorming—getting it all out on the table</em></span> discusses the concept of brainstorming and what kind of thing needs to be considered along the way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tools and methods for getting ideas out and organizing thoughts</em></span> will look at various tools and techniques for getting the ideas of your own as well as other members of the team out in the open in a more organized way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Then we will learn how to brainstorm in <span class="emphasis"><em>Brainstorming activities</em></span>, where we will see different ways to brainstorm, which will give you a starting point to get the creative juices flowing.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally,<span class="emphasis"><em> Implementing a brainstorming tool in Unity to shuffle ideas</em></span>, is where we take some preliminary ideas and implement them into Unity. Instead, we will learn that Unity will be a <span class="emphasis"><em>random idea generator</em></span> that will randomize ideas if a group is having a hard time to decide on one. It can even be used as a thought/idea generation tool, depending on the kind of input that the reader decides to implement.</p></li></ul></div></div>
