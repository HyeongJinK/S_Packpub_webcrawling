In this chapter, we will implement most of the logic for our application. We will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin,<span class="emphasis"><em> Designing our application </em></span>will have us designing the UI that will be used in our application.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next,<span class="emphasis"><em> Getting started </em></span>will explain how to implement different areas for content within our application, in particular, the lateral menu, the <span class="strong"><strong>Home</strong></span> page, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Task</strong></span> page.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As we progress through the chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the application interface </em></span>will cover how we can create the UI experience.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In<span class="emphasis"><em> Defining tasks</em></span>, we will learn how to create a custom class in C# that represents the concept of a task in the context of our application, and contains all the information needed in a task.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally,<span class="emphasis"><em> Dealing with tasks </em></span>will explain how to implement a <code class="literal">TaskManager</code> class that exposes different functions to handle a set of tasks within our application. In addition, it will provide a way to insert a new screen in the application where the user is able to create a new task by choosing different parameters for it.</p></li></ul></div><p>So, we're going to get our hands dirty, but at the end we will have the application running. As a result, we will be able to focus more on higher-level aspects of our application, such as gamification, in the next chapters. Furthermore, along the way, we will also be developing some skills in the Unity UI and learn how to use it to create the whole application. I didn't say that it will be easy, but for sure it's going to be fun! So, with this said, let's get started.</p></div>
