In fact, the work of tuning your application doesn't stop after the first tests. On the contrary, it goes through different iterations many times.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec102"></a>The iteration cycle</h3></div></div></div><p>The cycle starts with the planning stage, which includes brainstorming, organizing the work (as we have seen, for instance, in Scrum), and so on. In the next phase, development, we actually create the application, as we did in the last chapter. Then, there is the playtesting, which we have seen in this chapter. In the latter stage, we tune and tweak values, as well as fix bugs in our application.</p><p>Afterwards, we iterate the whole cycle again, by entering the planning stage again. Here, we need to plan the next iteration, what should be left, what should be done better, and what to remove. All these decisions should be based on what we have collected in the playtesting stage. The cycle is well represented in the following figure as a spiral that goes on and on throughout the process:</p><p>

</p><p>The point of mentioning it now is because, after you have finished playtesting your game, you will need to repeat the stages that we have done previously. You will have to <span class="emphasis"><em>modify</em></span> your design, you may need to even redesign things. So, it is better to think of this as <span class="emphasis"><em>upgrading</em></span> your design, rather than a tedious and repetitive process.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec103"></a>When to stop?</h3></div></div></div><p>In theory, there is no stopping. The more iteration there is, the better the application will be. Usually, the iterations stop when the application is good enough for your standards, or when external constraints, such as the market or deadlines, don't allow you to perform any more iterations.</p><p>The question <span class="emphasis"><em>when to stop?</em></span> is tricky, and the answer depends on many factors. You need to take into account the resources needed to perform another iteration, as well as time constraints. Of course, remember that your final goal is to deliver a quality product to your audience, and each iteration is a step closer.</p></div></div>
