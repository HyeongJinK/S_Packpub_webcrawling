By following these simple steps, you can get basic components into your prototype and get key functionality happening.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec64"></a>Placeholder sprites</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the best ways to distinguish between different elements in the scene, when we don't have the assets yet, is still visually. In fact, using temporary assets can be a handy and rapid way to understand the general look of the game. Therefore, we can use different shapes and colors.</p><p>From Unity 5.3, there is the possibility to have some shapes for sprites built in. You can have access to them by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Asset</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span>. As you can see from the following screenshot, we have different options to choose from:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Unity will create some new assets in your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view, as shown here:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>They can be then imported into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>If you need a custom number of edges for your polygon, you can select it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> button in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. You will see the following screen:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>From the top-left corner, you are able to change the number of the edges, and therefore obtain a custom polygon.</p><p>Furthermore, if we click on one of them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, we should see the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>From there, we can change the color variable and assign different colors to our shapes:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_011.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, we will have infinite combinations of colors and shapes. In fact, keep in mind that you can rotate and scale them as well! They should be enough to prototype every 2D game or game-like application:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_012.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec19"></a>Composing figures</h4></div></div></div><p>Even if after a while the number of sprites you can use seems to be limited, you can actually compose different figures from them. In this chapter, I'm going to show you some of them to give you an idea of the endless possibilities.</p><p>As a pro tip, I strongly suggest you store all the different figures inside an empty game object and save it as a prefab. As a result, you will be able to quickly use your shapes again.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note23"></a>Note</h3><p>You can find a lot more information about using and creating prefabs in Unity in the official documentation that can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec4"></a>Arrow</h5></div></div></div><p>Creating an arrow is really simple. You just need a rectangle and a triangle. For the rectangle, you can use a square and scale it on one side. Then, place the triangle on top of it. The following screenshot shows how, by highlighting the two polygons with different colors:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_013.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec5"></a>Star</h5></div></div></div><p>In order to create a star, we need two polygons with the same odd number of edges. The result will be a star with double the number of points of each polygon. So, for instance, if we use two triangles that have three points each, we will come up with a star with six points. Instead, if we use pentagons (polygons with five points each), we will have a star with 10 points. As you may understand, we cannot create a star with less than 6 points or with an odd number of edges in this way. However, this method is great to add some more figures to our prototype.</p><p>So, once we have decided which polygon to use, just duplicate it with <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl + D</em></span> and rotate the clone along the <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>-axis by 180 degrees. As a result, you will be able to create all these different stars, which you are free to color as you like:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_014.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec6"></a>Assets mock-up</h5></div></div></div><p>With these basic figures, you can also create rapid mock-ups of your assets. For example, you can create a small house, such as the one in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_015.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The house has been created with just ten sprites. The door is a stretched square with a circle for the handle. The windows are just squares; the squares that create the window frame are stretched. Finally, the house is just a big square with a scaled triangle on the top for the roof. By doing all of this, it should show you how easy prototyping is in Unity, and how to create temporary assets that look like the object you intend to represent in your game. Therefore, from now on, free your imagination and create as many assets as you want!</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec20"></a>Substituting the temporary assets</h4></div></div></div><p>Now, we need to briefly go through how to substitute our temporary assets with the final ones once we have them.</p><p>If you have placed everything to scale, and your art team (or yourself) has come up with assets that have the same dimensions of the graphics, then substitution is really easy. Just take the temporary asset you have created, such as a triangle, and change the <code class="literal">Sprite</code> variable in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. On the other hand, as often happens, the assets are sometimes not properly placed, or they need some adjustment to look as they should. However, this process should proceed quickly without many difficulties.</p><p>If we have placed a composed asset, such as the house of the previous section, then it is probably inside a game object. In this case, you can erase all of its children (the shapes that compose the object) and add a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> to the object. We can achieve this by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span>. Here, you can substitute the <code class="literal">Sprite</code> variable. Again, you might need some adjustments.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec65"></a>Using labels</h3></div></div></div><p>Another way to distinguish the objects, and to better communicate your idea, is to include a label with the name of the object.</p><p>In Unity, we are able to create them really quickly. Select the object that you want the label on. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, click on the cube symbol next to the name of the object, as shown here:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_016.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, you will see the following menu:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_017.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>In the first two lines, we see long bars with some colors. If we select one of them, a label with that color and the name of the object will appear in the scene view. This can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_018.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This is a great way to label all the objects in our game, so that even if it is just a circle, it may be our character in a game or a button for an application. Some of you may wonder what the other buttons below are in the previous menu. The little circle allows us to add a small circular icon of that color in the scene view. This is useful if you want to detect an object, or distinguish it without need of a label. An example is shown in the following screenshot with a triangle:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_019.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Finally, if we press the <span class="strong"><strong>Other</strong></span> button, then we can choose a custom icon among our assets. Also, it's a great way to place different objects of the same type with the same icon. Personally, the method that I'm more comfortable working with is to use labels because it makes the whole process a lot easier. However, the payoff is to name all the objects correctly in the scene, which is good practice in any case. Therefore, feel free to use the method that you prefer.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec66"></a>Gizmos</h3></div></div></div><p>One last method we will cover in this chapter is the use of <span class="strong"><strong>Gizmos</strong></span>. Unfortunately, we don't have time to go through this in detail, so we will just scratch the surface to understand why they are so useful. If you are interested in learning more about them, read the official documentation, which can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html</a>. Gizmos are icons or drawings inside the scene view that can change at runtime by using scripts. They are really useful during the debug process, but they can also be used to prototype complex movements or animations. In this chapter, we will just limit it to drawing a line.</p><p>First of all, create a new script, and rename it <code class="literal">GizmosExampleClass</code>. Double-click to open it. You can erase the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and the <code class="literal">Update()</code> function, since we will not use them.</p><p>Add the following variable, which holds a transform that we will use as the ending position of our line:</p><pre class="programlisting">public Transform target; 
</pre><p>When we deal with Gizmos, we need to implement a special function called <code class="literal">OnDrawGizmos()</code>. First, we need to check if our target is not null, to avoid reference to an object we don't have. Then, we can decide a color, by assigning the <code class="literal">Gizmos.color</code> variable. Finally, we can draw a line from the position of our object to the target:</p><pre class="programlisting">    void OnDrawGizmos () { 
        if (target != null) { 
            Gizmos.color = Color.magenta; 
            Gizmos.DrawLine(transform.position, target.position); 
        } 
    } 
</pre><p>Save the script, and create a couple of sprites, for instance, a triangle and a square. Attach the script to the <span class="strong"><strong>Square</strong></span>, and drag and drop the triangle into the target variable, as shown here:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_021.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view you should see the following (I also added the labels, as in the previous section, for ease of understanding):</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_022.jpg" /></div><p>
