What is it about them that you like? Are you a fan of progression, or do you like to be acknowledged for your efforts? In this section, we will focus on providing feedback to players, and how to keep them motivated and engaged. We will look at different examples of player feedback, such as progress bars, and how can we implement them into Unity.</p><p>Feedback can be both positive and negative, and can be provided to the user in more than one way. You can provide encouragement for eliminating multiple enemies with onscreen popups saying things such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Fantastic</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Multi-kill!</em></span> You can also achieve this by having positive sounds, usually sounds that are pleasant to the ear (such as a chime). In contrast, when a player does something wrong, you can display onscreen messages such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Fail</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Incorrect</em></span> and, just like positive sounds, you can have negative ones such as a loud horn and so forth. However, just like someone nagging you to put your dirty clothes in the laundry, you don't want to be constantly providing feedback on <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>, nor do you want to point out every failure. Instead, you want to try to and achieve an even balance of the two and for the right things.</p></div>
