To briefly summarize the content covered, we:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learnt about user considerations such as how understandings of people began, and how players are defined in games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussed different ways to engage the player based on progression loops and reward schedules</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Explored different ways to set up the player information in Unity in order to provide options to the player for basic customization (for example, change the profile image) as well as options for them to edit their information</p></li></ul></div><p>Other features that you might consider adding to your player's profile page is information related to their current mood, allowing them to set a status, or even social network handles. You can always check out the official Unity documentation that can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html</a>. Whatever you choose to include, make sure that you consider why you are adding it and whether or not your target group will benefit from it or not.</p><p>In the following chapter (<a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> An Engaged Player is a Happy Player</em></span>), we will look at how to engage the player. We will learn about different types of elements, how they can be used to maintain the player's engagement, and keep them motivated to progress throughout the rest of the game. We will also learn how to implement various types of elements in Unity, incorporate a survey, and how to add a social element (for example, social networking services) to your application.</p></div>
