Dashboards are a great way to keep a lot of information relatively concise and contained, without being too overwhelming to a player. Of course, if the player wants to obtain more detailed information, perhaps statistics about their accuracy since they began, they have the ability to do so.</p><p>So, what exactly is a <span class="emphasis"><em>dashboard</em></span>? A dashboard is a central hub to view all of your progress, achievements, points, and rewards. If we have a look at the following screenshots, we can get a rough idea of the kind of information that they display. The image on the left is the dashboard for <span class="strong"><strong>Memrise</strong></span> and displays current language courses, in this case German, the player's achievements, streak, and progress that he or she is making in the course. On the right is the dashboard for <span class="strong"><strong>DuoLingo</strong></span>. Similar to Memrise, it also features information about daily streaks, amount of time committed, and the strength of each category learned for the new language, which in this case is Italian. By just looking at these dashboards, the player can get a very quick idea about how well or <span class="emphasis"><em>badly</em></span> they are doing:</p><p>

</p><p>Different dashboards: Memrise (left) and DuoLingo (right)</p><p>Different approaches to dashboards can encourage different behaviors depending on what data is displayed and <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> it is displayed. For example, you can have a dashboard that provides reflective information more dominantly, such as progress bars and points. Others can provide a more social approach, displaying the player's rank among friends, and comparing their statistics to others who are also engaging with the application. Some dashboards may even suggest <span class="emphasis"><em>friends</em></span> that have similar elements in common such as the language being learned.</p><p>Ideally, the dashboard's design can be as simple or as complicated as the designer decides, but typically, the <span class="emphasis"><em>less is more</em></span> approach is better.</p><p>Now so far, we have gotten our feet wet with the world of Unity. From the beginning of this book, we have discussed users, implementing some features of our application in Unity, and some theoretical underpinning of what gamification is all about. We have a profile page, some health, progress bars, and they are all nice enough but, when it comes to developing our application on a larger scale, we need to consider how to work as part of a group. For example, we don't always have access to icons and image packs, nor do we possess all the skills that we need to get our application where we want it. Therefore, we need a team, and more importantly we need to know how to work with others. In order to work in a team, we need a workflow process, some methodologies to ensure that things run smoothly and the project (and its parts) are finished and ready to be implemented within a scheduled timeframe. The following section will look at what it means to work as part of a team and what agile gamification is all about. While working by ourselves, we are able to achieve great things, but when working with others, we can turn them into extraordinary things.</p></div>
