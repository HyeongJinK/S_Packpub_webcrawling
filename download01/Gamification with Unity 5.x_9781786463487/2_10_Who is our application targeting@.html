Not only do user considerations include the demographics of the user, for example, who they are, and where they are from, but also the aim of the experience, the objectives that you are aiming to achieve, and outcomes that the objective(s) lead to.</p><p>Let's consider a few real-life consequences that your application/game will have on its audience:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>For example, will a loyalty application encourage people to engage with your products/store in the areas that you're targeting it towards? Are you creating a game to teach Spanish to children, teenagers, or adults? This will change the way that you need to think about your audience. For example, children tend to be users who are encouraged to play by their parents; teenagers tend to be a bit more autonomous, but may still be influenced by their parents; and adults are usually completely autonomous. Therefore, this can influence the amount and type of feedback that you give and how often.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Where is your audience from? For example, are you creating an application for a global reward program or a local one? This will affect whether or not you incorporate things such as localization features, so that the application, adapts to your audience automatically or whether it's embedded into the design.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What kind of devices does your audience use? Do they live in an area where they have access to a stable Internet connection? Do they need to have a powerful system to run your game or application? Chances are that, if the answer is yes to the latter, then you should probably look at how you optimize your application.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now that we have some basic ideas outlined about our potential users, it is time to explore who they are in a bit more detail and unpack each of the preceding considerations.</p></div>
