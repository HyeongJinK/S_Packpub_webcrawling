Overall, we looked at how to generate ideas for various game projects. We looked at different brainstorming tools to help make the brainstorming process easier and more manageable. Next, we looked at different methods of brainstorming to get the best ideas out and to also help inspire the creation of new ones. Then, we looked at how to create a randomized idea generator in Unity, which can be also repurposed in many different ways. In fact, we explored and learned how to create an editor script to use Unity not only to produce something for the final user, but also to help us during the creation process. In particular, we learned more about the <code class="literal">EditorWindow</code> class and how it is possible to use different <code class="literal">EditorGUI</code> elements to achieve powerful layouts with just a few lines of code.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will begin with an introduction to the project that we will create during the rest of this book. We will look at various methods of prototyping. In addition, we will also look at implementing basic navigation into Unity. We will do this with a preliminary mock-up that will form part of the project.</p></div>
