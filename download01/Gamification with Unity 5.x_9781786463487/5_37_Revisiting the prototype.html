In fact, the most important part is testing and revisiting the prototype. Of course, as we have seen, while we construct a prototype, we make many decisions, and try to figure out which one fits better. Even failing is allowed to better construct a new prototype. However, even when it seems that it is stable and works as it should, the prototype is not finished yet. The next step is testing the prototype with real users and to get their opinions and thoughts about your prototype.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec68"></a>Testing with the closest people</h3></div></div></div><p>The first group of people you should use as testers are the people in your team and the families of your team. In fact, these people are easy to reach and probably willing to help you improve your projects. However, there are some considerations to take into account. For instance, they are strongly biased. Therefore, you should be careful. In any case, they will provide you with a solid background when testing with other people that do not know or know only a little of your project.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec69"></a>Testing with external people</h3></div></div></div><p>Testing with external people is definitely better, but also definitely more difficult. In the first place, they most probably will not be willing to help you without something in return. If you cannot afford to pay them, there are other different options. One of these options is to reward the people with a copy of your application once it is finished. Another could be to add their name to the credit list.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec70"></a>How to test</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different ways to test your prototype with people. The simplest way is to just watch testers play around with your application. Techniques that are more sophisticated include questionnaires and measurements of metrics. Playtesting is covered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Break, Destroy, and Rebuild - the Art of Playtesting and Iteration</em></span>, so be sure to check it out in more detail.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec71"></a>Revisiting your prototype and iterating</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you have collected all your feedback, it's time to revisit your prototype. Take into consideration all the different feedback you received, and see what it has in common. Try to draw a main direction, and from this abstract direction, create a list of improvements to your application for a specific part of it. You should focus on one part of it at a time. Finally, once you have implemented all the tasks, you need to repeat the entire process and iterate.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip24"></a>Tip</h3><p>Of course, in this section we have just scratched the surface of testing and revisiting. We will take a deeper look at all these topics in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Graduating Your Project to Completion</em></span>, where we will learn the different techniques through a practical example.</p></div></div></div>
