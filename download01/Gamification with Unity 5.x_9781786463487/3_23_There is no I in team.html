But the problem with working in a team is that we're all not equal. Some of us are driven by the project, with the aim of getting the best possible outcome. Others are driven by fame, reward, money, and the list goes on. If you have ever worked on a <span class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span> project, then you know exactly what it's like. Agile gamification is, to put simply, getting teams working <span class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> together.</p><p>Often, large complex projects encounter a wide range of problems, from keeping on top of schedules, different perspectives, undefined roles, and a lack of overall motivation. Agile frameworks in this context are associated with the term Scrum. This describes an overall framework used to formalize software development projects. The scrum process works like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The owner of the product creates a <span class="emphasis"><em>wish list</em></span> known as the product backlog.</p></li><li><p>Once the sprint planning begins, members of the team (between 3-9 people) take sections from the top of the product backlog. Sprint planning involves the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>List all of the items that need to be completed for the project (in story format: who, what, and why). This list needs to be prioritized.</p></li><li><p>Estimate each task relatively (using the Fibonacci system).</p></li><li><p>Plan the work sprint (1-2 weeks long, but less than 1 month long), working towards a demo.</p></li><li><p>Make the work visible by using a storyboard: <span class="emphasis"><em>to do</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>doing</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>done</em></span>. Items begin in the <span class="emphasis"><em>to do</em></span> section. Once they have begun, they move to the <span class="emphasis"><em>doing</em></span> section, and once they have been completed, they are put in the <span class="emphasis"><em>done</em></span> section. The idea is that the team works through tasks in a burn down chart. Ideally, the amount of <span class="emphasis"><em>points</em></span> that the sprint began with (in terms of tasks to be done) decreases in value each day, the closer you get to finishing the sprint.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Trello</strong></span> is program that does story boarding like this: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">www.trello.com</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>The team engages with daily meetings (preferably standing up) run by the sprint/scrum master. These meetings discuss what has been done; what is planned to be done during the day; any issues that come up, or might come up; and how can improvements be made.</p></li><li><p>Provide a demonstration of the product's basic (working) features. During this stage, feedback is provided by the product owner relating to whether or not they are happy with what has been done, the direction that it is going, and how it will relate to the remaining parts of the project. At this stage, the owner may ask you to improve it, iterate it, and so forth, for the next sprint.</p></li><li><p>Â Lastly, the idea is to get the team together and to review the development of the project as a whole, what went well and what didn't go so well. What are areas of improvement that can then be used to make the next <span class="emphasis"><em>scrum</em></span> better?</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>Next, they decide on how to implement each section. They will meet each day to not only assess the overall progress made for the development of each section, but to ensure that the work will be achieved within the timeframe.</p></li><li><p>Throughout the process, the team leader known as the scrum/sprint master has the job of ensuring that the team stays focused and completes sections of the product backlog on time.</p></li><li><p>Once the sprint is finished, the work should be at a high enough level to be shipped, sold to the customer, or to at least shown to a stakeholder.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the sprint, the team and scrum/sprint master assess the work completed, and determine if it is at an acceptable level.</p></li><li><p>If the work is approved, the next sprint begins. Just like the first sprint, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins the process again.</p><p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>An overview of the scrum process</p><p>However, in the modern world, <span class="emphasis"><em>scrum</em></span> has been adopted and applied to a range of different contexts outside software development. As a result, it has gone through some iterations, one of which includes gamification. <span class="emphasis"><em>Agile gamification</em></span>, as it is more commonly known, takes the concept of scrum and turns it into a playful experience.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>Adding an element of fun to agile frameworks</h3></div></div></div><p>To turn the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>scrum</em></span> into something a bit more interesting and at the same time boosting the overall motivation of your team, certain parts of it can be transformed with game elements. For example, implementing leaderboards based on the amount of tasks that each team member is able to complete (and on time) results in a certain amount of points. By the end of the sprint, the team member with the most points may be able to obtain a reward, such as a bonus in their next pay or an extended lunch break. It is also possible to make the burn-down chart a bit more exciting, such as placing various <span class="emphasis"><em>bonuses</em></span> if certain objectives are met within certain timeframes, or at a certain point during the <span class="emphasis"><em>burn-down</em></span>, giving added incentive to team members to get things delivered on time as a result. In addition, to ensure that quality standards are also maintained, <span class="emphasis"><em>scrum/sprint masters</em></span> can also provide additional rewards if there is little or no feedback regarding things such as quality or the overall cohesiveness of the output from the sprint. An example of a gamified framework can be seen in the following screenshot. While setting up a DuoLingo classroom account, users are presented with various game elements, for example, a progress bar shows how much of the setup the user has completed, and a checklist ensures that everything that needs to be completed is done.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip14"></a>Tip</h3><p>Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons? It might be worth checking it out when trying to come up with ways to design challenges for a sprint. The scrum/sprint master can be considered like the Dungeon Master, and the team members like those embarking on the quest.</p></div><p>
