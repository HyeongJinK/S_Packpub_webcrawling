In this case, we need to simulate the passage from one screen to another without implementing it all. After all, we are just prototyping to see which is the best solution.</p><p>So, now you have some rough ideas of what you want to do in Unity. You might have a simple mock-up ready, and now you want to see how it feels as you navigate through that mock-up. This can be done in many ways in Unity, we will see just one of these. The core idea is to include every screen inside an empty game object. Once we have all our screens inside some game objects, it's also useful to rename them in order to understand what they are. At the end, you should have something like the following in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_023.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>At this stage, we are able to see all of them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, but we don't want this. Therefore, we need to deactivate all of them but one. To deactivate them, just uncheck the little box next to the game object name (<span class="strong"><strong>Screen 2</strong></span>), on the left, as highlighted in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_024.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, we should come up with something like this in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_025.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Then, to pass from one screen to another one, just deactivate the current game object and activate another screen. In the previous chapter, we learned about editor scripts. You can implement this switching automatically by using them. Now, we are finished with creating the initial prototype within Unity.</p></div></div>
