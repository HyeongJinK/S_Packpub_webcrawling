We began with the design of basic assets, which we will need later on. Then, we learned how to use Adobe Illustrator to actually make the assets we need as well as some tips and tricks for using the software. Finally, we moved back into Unity and understood the process of importing assets and made them ready to be used.</p><p>In the next chapter, <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Get Your Motor Running</em></span>, we will focus on making the most of our application by adding cool new interactive features. Since this is so exciting, don't waste any more time, turn the page!</p></div>
