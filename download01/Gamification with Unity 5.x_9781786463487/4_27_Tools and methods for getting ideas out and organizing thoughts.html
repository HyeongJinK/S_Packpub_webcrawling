Brainstorming is a vital yet messy process. Also, depending on the ability of your team to meet on a regular basis, and how they meet (such as in person or online), can cause a range of problems if you want to keep things organized. The following suggestions offer some strategies for managing this both in a virtual and physical sense, but feel free to use or explore other methods that work for you.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec33"></a>Start pinning with Pinterest</h3></div></div></div><p>Pinterest (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">www.pinterest.com</a>) is a great starting place to get some basic ideas of all aspects of your application. In fact, because it is primarily based on images (and their associated content) it is a perfect place for inspiration. You can create an account pretty easily, and then once you're ready to go, it's just a matter of setting up <span class="emphasis"><em>boards</em></span>. You can think of boards much the same as a fridge covered in postcards and magnets from your recent trip. It's a collage of different images all centered on the same thing, and the best part is that they can be private or public, it's up to you. If we have a look at the following screenshot, you can see an example of a board with all of its <span class="emphasis"><em>pins</em></span>. Each pin can be accompanied by a description and links to the website that it is related to. For example, if it's a piece of art, then the image may be located on the artist's website. In addition, you can also add other users to help contribute to the board of ideas! However, they will also need a Pinterest account:</p><p>
