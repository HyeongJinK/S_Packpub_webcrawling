For example, you could be creating a fitness application for a 22-year-old female business student who lives in Melbourne, Australia. They could be a user who plays games on a regular basis, or someone who has never even played a game, or they could be a combination of the two. As a result, it is important that you define who your user is early on so that each decision that you make along the way is considered through their perspective.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"></a>The amount of dedication</h3></div></div></div><p>Not everyone who plays your game may game on a regular basis. There are varying ends of the spectrum from <span class="strong"><strong>Newbie</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Hardcore</strong></span> gamers and the following list explains each in a bit more detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Newbie </strong></span>gamers are people who are more than likely trying games for the first time. They are from all ages and demographics. When creating games that include these types of gamer, it is important that you have help available. This may be provided in many ways such as walkthroughs from when they first install the game or application to an informative <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> menu or online support forum.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Casual</strong></span> gamers can refer to people who game less frequently than other gamers do. They may do this on their commute home, to fill in time while waiting at the dentist or at home. They tend to go for games that require a lot of time or commitment, and where the play sessions are short.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Core</strong></span> gamers engage with a variety of different games that usually require a lot more time than games played by a casual gamer. The level of commitment given by core gamers allows them to experience more detailed narratives, complex gameplay, and engage with a more comprehensive experience.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hardcore</strong></span> gamers engage with every element of the game, from learning, practicing, and memorizing complex button combinations, to studying statics of online virtual currency and trading, managing and running guilds, as well as staying up to date with the latest news on games as well as gaming events.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Professional</strong></span> gamers as the name suggests play to win not just points, but also gain from their skills financially. They tend to participate in competitions at a local, national, and even global level and gain many spectators around the world.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip9"></a>Tip</h3><p>A fun activity to do in order to design for your target audience is to develop personas. These can be fictitious future users that will have a range of different demographics, personalities, and requirements. That way, you can begin to consider different needs of different users.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>Defining the role of your player</h3></div></div></div><p>What your player will do in the game is important, and defining this earlier on can help them to understand not just the purpose of the gaming experience, but also what they need to do to achieve it. In this way, making it clear what the player has to do, as well as shouldn't or can't do, makes it easier for the player to understand their role within the experience.</p><p>When we begin to design a game, we may be enticed by our own experiences to have something graphically sophisticated with increasingly difficult challenges and an epic three-headed beast at the end, which we will spend countless hours, blood, sweat, and tears trying to destroy. Then we remember that we are creating a game for primary school kids to learn mathematics. So unless the <span class="emphasis"><em>mathematic</em></span> element is to learn how to count the amount of heads on the beast, then the concept is not ideal. In addition, it is likely that primary school students don't play games for extended periods of time, and are not considered Hardcore gamers. Therefore, a game that requires 48 hours of leveling up, exploring, and battling isn't going to achieve our goals. Therefore, considering the amount of <span class="emphasis"><em>dedication</em></span> that is required from each player earlier on can also give some insight about what the player is required to do.</p><p>If you're asking a casual gamer to remember complicated button patterns to finish the first level, either your target group is wrong or you need to modify what you are asking the player to do. Each time that you find yourself wanting to add another element or layer to the gaming experience, ask yourself questions such as: Is adding a three-headed beast going to help teach mathematics or only make the experience more enjoyable?</p></div></div>
