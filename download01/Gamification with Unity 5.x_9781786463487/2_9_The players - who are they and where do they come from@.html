It is your job to create a gaming experience that will captivate them; to keep them engaged and curious for long enough to explore the world that you have spent a tireless number of hours perfecting. What do you know about them and what do you <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to know about them in order to create such a game? A few questions that immediately strike a game designer are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Are they someone who responds well to challenges, or do they run from them?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Do they like games with a good story, or do they prefer action?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Or is it that they like a combination of the two?</p></li></ul></div><p>Before we commence with the game designing process, we need to find out more about these things. We do this in order to provide an optimal game environment for not just this person, but for other people like them. For many years, attempts have been made to categorize gamers into what is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>player types</em></span>. Player types attempt to synthesize various traits exhibited during play into player types in order to differentiate an individual's behavior within games. To illustrate this concept, we can refer to Bartle's infamous player types, which were based on the data collected about what users of MUD's experienced as "<span class="emphasis"><em>fun"</em></span>, Bartle identified that players fell into one of four categories - Achiever, Socializer, Explorer, or Killer and they are defined as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Achievers</strong></span> act <span class="emphasis"><em>ON</em></span> the world. They typically play to win in games and feel accomplished through defined goals and progressing with their character through the world's built-in ranking system.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Socializers</strong></span> interact <span class="emphasis"><em>WITH</em></span> other players and find the greatest reward in games having the opportunity to interact with others.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Explorers</strong></span> interact <span class="emphasis"><em>WITH</em></span> the world and enjoy discovering new areas and gaining new knowledge of their surroundings.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Killers</strong></span> act <span class="emphasis"><em>ON</em></span> players and enjoy dominating other players by attacking, killing, or simply making their life hard within the virtual environment.</p><p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>A figure showing Bartle's players.</p><p>Not long after the development of the initial four player types, Bartle observed that players tended to fluctuate between the player typologies. In an attempt to cater for these fluctuations, Bartle added another dimension to the traditional model, establishing a further eight player types to his original model:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Opportunists</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLICIT</em></span> Achievers and try to take advantage of a situation any given situation while trying to avoid challenges.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Planners</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>EXPLICIT</em></span> Achievers and take the time to plan their actions, with a larger scheme/plan in mind.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hackers</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLICIT</em></span> Explorers and experiment to reveal meaning and seek to discover new phenomena.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scientists</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>EXPLICIT</em></span> Explorers and experiment within the gaming experience to form theories and explain new phenomena.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Friends</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLICIT</em></span> Socializers and mainly interact with people they already have established relationships with.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Networkers</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>EXPLICIT</em></span> Socializers and seek out people to interact with based on assessing and getting to know them.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Grievers</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>IMPLICIT</em></span> Killers and are very much in your personal space with the aim of obtaining a menacing reputation.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Politicians</strong></span> are <span class="emphasis"><em>EXPLICIT</em></span> Killers and manipulate people accordingly to suit their needs as well as acting with well-developed foresight.</p></li></ol></div><p>The following figure is a representation of Bartle's update to the traditional model:</p><p>

</p><p>Figure of Bartle's players</p><p>Now, at this stage, you might be wondering, what is the point of all this? Why am I reading a book about Gamification in Unity and learning about player typologies? The answer is simple. Not only are these referred to in the development of gamified applications, but they also act as a lens to study the effects of gamified applications (and games in general). It is important to understand that players not only engage with the game or gamified application in a particular way, but also each other. Lastly, while Bartle's typology is perhaps the most well-known typology among player typologies, many others exist; some even criticize the Bartle typology altogether! So, whether you believe in one typology or another, it is definitely worthwhile exploring other types to become more grounded in the concept and to broaden your considerations for players as a whole.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to find out more about Bartle's player types, check out the following book:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Designing Virtual Worlds</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Richard Bartle</em></span>.</p><p>Other books and publications, which are also recommended:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

Context is an important consideration because it can influence the design and development of the game (for example, hardware, resources, and target group). For example, a gamified experience aimed at encouraging students to submit assessments on time and used at school will be designed differently from one promoting customer loyalty and for use within supermarkets. Therefore, a design that is developed through the lens of the context that it is intended for is likely to be more targeted than one designed with a general context in mind. Contexts can be as broad or as specific as the designer wants to get. For now, here is a general list of concepts that you can consider to direct your application towards:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Education</strong></span>: As we discussed in <span class="emphasis"><em>Chapter 1, The Anatomy of Games</em></span>, games can be educational. They may be designed only to teach or they may have elements of learning entwined into them to support learning material. Depending on the type of learning game, it may include formal (educational institutions) or informal educational environments (learning a language for a business trip). Therefore, if you are thinking about creating an educational game, you might need to think about these considerations in more detail.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Some examples of games that would fit an <span class="emphasis"><em>educational</em></span> context are games that specifically aim to educate or teach concepts ranging from language learning (DuoLingo <a class="ulink" href="http://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">www.duolingo.com</a>), to understanding physics (Ludwig).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Business</strong></span>: Maybe your intention is get your employees arriving to work on time or finishing reports in the afternoon rather than right before they go home. Designing content for use within a business context targets situations that occur within the workplace. It can include objectives such as increasing employee productivity (individual/group).
</p><p>Games that would fit a <span class="emphasis"><em>business</em></span> context include SimCity <a class="ulink" href="http://www.simcity.com" target="_blank">www.simcity.com</a>, Roller-coaster Tycoon Series <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-deluxe" target="_blank">http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-deluxe</a>, and Capitalism <a class="ulink" href="http://www.capitalismlab.com" target="_blank">www.capitalismlab.com</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Personal</strong></span>: Getting personal with gamified applications can relate specifically to creating experiences to achieve personal objectives. These may include personal development or productivity, becoming more organized or healthier, and so on. Ultimately, only one person maintains these experiences; however, other social elements such as leaderboards and group challenges can bring others into the personal experience as well.
</p><p>Some examples of games that would fit a <span class="emphasis"><em>personal</em></span> context can be targeted to health and fitness such as Fitbit, various loyalty programs, and lifestyle applications like Fabulous - Motivate Me! <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thefabulous.co" target="_blank">www.thefabulous.co</a>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>: If it's not just educational, business, or personal development, chances are you probably want to create a game that provides a portal into lustrous worlds of wonder or to pass the time during a player's daily commute. Pure gaming contexts have no personal objectives (other than to overcome challenges of course!).</p><p>Games that would fit a <span class="emphasis"><em>gaming</em></span> context and can include anything from Assassin's Creed <a class="ulink" href="http://www.assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">www.assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/home</a> to Zork <a class="ulink" href="http://tinyurl.com/ZorkTheGame" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/ZorkTheGame</a> and everything in between.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
