The amazing thing about the world that we live in is that if you can think it, you can create it, <span class="emphasis"><em>in one way or another</em></span>. In this chapter, we will finally start to build our application, and bring it to life! In particular, we cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin this chapter, we will look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing our application</em></span>, which focuses on getting our idea out of our head and onto paper.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the game elements and An introduction to Illustrator </em></span>will guide you through learning the basics of Adobe Illustrator to create basic icons for our application</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The we will look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Importing the graphics into Unity</em></span> so that you can learn how to get the creations we have made in Illustrator into Unity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will then learn how to<span class="emphasis"><em> Import Settings in Unity </em></span>and how to set up Unity properly so that the assets we import are ready to go into our application</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To conclude this chapter, we will look at<span class="emphasis"><em> Importing and </em></span>setting<span class="emphasis"><em> our assets in Unity</em></span> to making sure that everything is working as it should and that we are able to have a functioning application for the later chapters of the book</p></li></ul></div><p>So now, we're going to talk about something exciting, the project that we will create throughout the rest of the book! What kind of project is it, you may be wondering? Well, it's going to be an application that will combine all of the knowledge that you have gained over the last four chapters and start to bring it together. But wait, there's more! We will also be developing some more skills and learn a thing or two along the way. So, get yourself comfortable, you're in for a real treat.</p></div>
