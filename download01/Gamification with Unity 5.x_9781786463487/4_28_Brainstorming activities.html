It can be in groups or on your own. In the next section is a list of five activities to get the ideas out of your head, on to paper, and turn them into something extraordinary. Remember that the idea with brainstorming is to get what's in your head out and on paper. It's not meant to be perfect, but rather like emptying a box of jigsaw puzzle pieces. It's only after you begin to sift through them that you know what is useful.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec36"></a>Spinning the wheel of randomness</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're stuck for ideas to begin with, Andrew Bosley's <span class="emphasis"><em>The Brainstomer</em></span>, <a class="ulink" href="http://andrewbosley.weebly.com/the-brainstormer.html" target="_blank">http://andrewbosley.weebly.com/the-brainstormer.html</a>, which is shown in the following screenshot, is a nifty tool to get some creative juices flowing. There are many different ways to approach The Brainstormer; you could begin with a story that is based on the three elements, or allow each of the three elements to inspire a part of the gamified experience. For example, the first wheel could reveal something about the concept of the game. In this instance, <span class="emphasis"><em>Fish out of water</em></span> could build on the idea of <span class="emphasis"><em>trying something new</em></span>. The second wheel could reveal something about the environment, for example, you need to explore a perfect world (free from zombies!) and to maintain it, you must maintain a healthy habit.</p><p>Lastly, the third wheel could reveal a potential character, such as the player his or herself, or a character from the game. For example, the player may have to meet a wizard who needs your help to keep the utopian world from becoming dystopian:</p><p>

Some things to keep in mind are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Look at what other types are currently available.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Look at their feedback. This will usually give you an indication of what has gone right or wrong. Then from this, you can gain some insights about the way you should approach the design of your own application.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make notes about everything such as the colors (are there consistent ones).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"></a>Game on with Gamicards</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gamicards</strong></span> is a great start for brainstorming ideas in the very beginning and seeing how you can play around with different game elements and mechanics with an idea that you might have. You can incorporate your ideas from other brainstorming activities to get your idea gamified! All it takes is a little imagination and the possibilities are endless.</p><p>If we have a look at the following screenshot, the hexagonal shape allows you to build different structures to organize your ideas in a meaningful workflow. Furthermore, they are not only used as just a brainstorming tool. In fact, not only do they support you during the design process, but they also test the gamification infrastructure of your application. By doing this, you can check to see if you are still heading towards the goals that you have in mind:</p><p>

Once they have finished, they then swap their piece of paper with the person next to them, and then they elaborate on each of these five ideas. Then, they pass it to the next person, and so on. This continues until everyone in the group has added something to each other's starting five ideas. Of course, you can continue to exchange the ideas for however long you wish. At the end, the group goes around and discusses each idea and how it has developed, and from that, refines the ideas for the overall project. Remember, your ideas don't have to be confined to realistic concepts. Blue-sky thinking, anything and everything should be written down.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec40"></a>Getting moody with mood boards</h3></div></div></div><p>Mood boards are a great way of getting the <span class="emphasis"><em>look and feel</em></span> of what you want your game to be like. Mood boards include images of anything and everything from the UI, to characters, color schemes, and so on. Some ways to begin mood boards include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Take pictures everywhere and anywhere of things that inspire you or give you some kind of idea about your game. Keep a note of them.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Begin with a large image that captures your overall theme and then add smaller images around it that help to build and add to the theme. For example, you might start with a large image of someone running, and the surrounding images relate to products that are associated with your target audience such as shoes, watches, and so on. You might also add images of color schemes that relate to the image. For example, bright and bold colors appear to create a fun and vibrant atmosphere.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Remember, mood boards don't have to be digital. Find cutouts from magazines, print outs, and so on. Create a space within the work area that people can contribute to. Having an <span class="emphasis"><em>open space mood board</em></span> can be a great way for people to reflect before contributing, but make sure that with each image, there is an explanation to provide some context.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Ask someone who is not part of the project to give you feedback about your mood board to see if they also <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> the mood that you're trying to create. Sometimes we can get so caught up that we forget to take a few steps back from what we are doing.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip17"></a>Tip</h3><p>A great resource for this is Pinterest. You can even add other people to collaborate on the board with you, how awesome is that?</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec41"></a>Creating the ideal ideation sessions</h3></div></div></div><p>So, you have an idea, but what about the opinions of people who could be your potential consumers? Ideation sessions can be run both in-group and out. The effectiveness of running one with both is that you get a better insight about what consumers may actually want and even think about your idea that you may not necessarily would have thought to be the case. For example, in your group ideation session, you want to add some cool coupon retrieval system that users can access after a certain period. However, running the ideation session with members of your potential consumer group reveals that they don't want to have to wait to unlock such features, and if this is the case, then they probably won't use the application. Some things to keep in mind when running an ideation session are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Have a clear focus of what you want to achieve but don't let it rule the session. You want to create a relaxed atmosphere where the ideas flow, but at the same time you want to remain focused. It's just about maintaining a balance. Feel free to experiment with different things such as whiteboards, easels, and even Lego!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Have a varied mix of people as part of the group: ages, demographics, gender, and so on. The more varied the group, the more varied the feedback. Remember that the world is a diverse place, and so will your consumers be!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Start with a no-restriction brainstorming session. Get all of your participants to say anything and everything that comes to mind based on the topic of the session. Then, refocus the ideas, while eventually filtering out the general ones and refining the ones that have the most impact. Then once you are done, choose around three and detail them. By this point, everyone should be on target and the discussions will become more concentrated.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Take care of them! Remember that these people are offering you their time, in exchange for a great product that you will then profit from. It goes without saying, but it is important to remember this. Keep them engaged, and if you can see that the atmosphere is tense, try some ice-breaking games. Give them praise for their contributions. Of course, if your budget allows, provide them with some snacks and beverages, especially if they will be there for a while. A little goes a long way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keep in touch with your participants. Not all of the great ideas come at a specific moment. You never know, a participant might think of something fantastic after they have left and you don't want that idea going to waste, so not only provide them with your contact details, but also follow up after the session.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"></a>Tip</h3><p>Don't get too attached to your early ideas. Usually, the first one or two and sometimes even tenth idea are the worst. When brainstorming, write down anything and everything. It's not meant to be perfect, it's meant to be raw and out there.</p></div></div></div>
