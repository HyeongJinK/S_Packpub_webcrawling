However, some tweaks in the settings are needed in order to use the assets for our gamified application. In this section, we will go through the basics of this process, and learn how to import sprites correctly.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec77"></a>Importing assets</h3></div></div></div><p>In Unity, there are different ways to import assets.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>From the top menu bar</strong></span>: Just click on <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset...</strong></span> and a file selection menu appears. Then, navigate through your folders and select the file that you would like to import.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>From the Project panel</strong></span>: Right-click on it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset...</strong></span>, a file selection menu appears and the asset that you select to import will be imported into the folder where you right-clicked.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Drag and drop</strong></span>: From the explorer of your OS, you can just drag and drop the files you want into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. In particular, if you drop them into a folder, they will be imported into that specific folder.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, the easiest way to import the assets is the last one, and I'll use this. However, just feel free to use the one that you prefer or suits your needs better.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec78"></a>Import Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>Once we click on an asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, its <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span> appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. They may change with different kinds of asset, but since our application is 2D, we will mainly use images, and therefore sprites. For instance, let's select <span class="strong"><strong>badges-sheet</strong></span>; we will see the following in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_037.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The first option to take into consideration is the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span>. If we have selected 2D mode when we created the project, it should already be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>. If it is not, then you need to change this option back to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> for all of the assets that you have imported.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>If our game is not set in 2D, it could be because we forgot to do so when we created the game, but we can change that</em></span>. You need to go to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span>. If you go into the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Behavior Mode</strong></span> settings, you can change the <span class="strong"><strong>Mode</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_038.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Selecting 2D mode changes the default settings of Unity for many things. We don't have time to go through all of them in detail, but we can explore the main ones. The scene is always set in 2D with the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> in a different position and different settings, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> mode. Once we have set the asset to the sprite, we have the type of sprite as a second option. By default, it is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Single</strong></span>, but it can be changed to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Polygonal</strong></span> (only from Unity 5.3). As the names suggest, the first is used when the imported image contains just a single sprite. The second mode is when we have a sprite sheet with more than one sprite. Finally, the last one is used when we have polygonal sprite, with any number of edges. The <span class="strong"><strong>Packing Tag</strong></span> option is used to gain performance from the graphic card, since Unity merges all the images with the same tag in a unique sheet, which is easier to process for your computer. Therefore, since we don't have any particular need, we can just decide on a name for our <span class="strong"><strong>Packing Tag</strong></span>, and assign it to all our assets. For instance, it could be <code class="literal">Badges</code>. Remember that the name must be the same for all our assets in order to include them in the same package. Finally, the last two options that we are going to use are the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Per Unit</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span>. The first is used to tell Unity how big our assets are with respect to our scene. By default, it is set to <code class="literal">100</code>, but this number really depends on how large the images you have imported are. In any case, remember that you can always scale the sprite once it's in the scene. The <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span> option, instead, indicates where the pivot points are in the image. It works only if the sprite type is <span class="strong"><strong>Single</strong></span> and it contains a series of presets. Otherwise, by opening the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, we can change it into a custom position. Lastly, <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Filter</strong></span> are used for optimization, and we will see them later on.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec79"></a>The Sprite Editor</h3></div></div></div><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span>, you can always find a button labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>. By pressing it, we can open the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_039.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This is a really useful tool in Unity, since it allows us to change the pivot points of Sprites and to identify multiple sprites if we have all of them in a sheet, as in our case. Therefore, its behavior depends on how the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Type</strong></span> option is set. In our case, it has to be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiply</strong></span> before clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>. Unity might ask to apply your changes in <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span> before opening the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, and of course we need to accept. There are many ways to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> in Unity, but we don't have the time to go through all of them.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>If you really want to learn every single trick about 2D game development in Unity, and how to use all of these tools, I recommend that you check out the following book:<span class="emphasis"><em> Getting started with Unity 2D Game Development - Second Edition</em></span> by Franscesco Sapio (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/game-development/getting-started-unity-2d-game-development-second-edition" target="_blank">www.packtpub.com/game-development/getting-started-unity-2d-game-development-second-edition</a>).</p></div><p>The quickest way possible to select all the sprites is to use <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span> mode. In the top left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, there is the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> menu, which we can access by pressing the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button. For your convenience, it is highlighted in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_040.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> menu, once opened, looks like this:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_041.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, we can select different types. However, we will only use the the <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span> type. It is the <span class="emphasis"><em>best guess</em></span> of Unity about the selections of the sprites. In fact, there is nothing else to set, Unity will do everything automatically. We don't need to have sprites of the same size; this way works pretty well. Here is the final result applied to our image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_042.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>What you may also notice about the preceding screenshot is that each sprite has a box around it, indicating that it has been <span class="emphasis"><em>sliced</em></span> and is ready to go. However, another method to select the sprites in our sheet is just to click and drag a rectangle around the sprite we want. This is the completely <span class="strong"><strong>Manual</strong></span> mode, where you can adjust every single detail. For all the other intermediate ways and tools, refer to the book quoted in the previous info box. Using the manual way, we can select our sprites as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_043.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>However, just stick with the previous result from the <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span> mode, since we don't have any particular need. If you click on one of our selections, it doesn't matter if we created them with the <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Manual</strong></span> mode, in the bottom right corner we will have the following menu:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_044.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This menu also allows us to change the dimension of the selection of the position of its pivot point. These options are for fine tuning, if we really need it. But in this menu, we can also set the name of this specific selection. It is good practice to give a specific name to the selection, especially if the sheet contains different sprites with a different logical meaning. Sprite sheets that have the same meaning are, for instance, animation sheets. In this case, we don't need to rename every single selection, since those sprites are just frames of the same animation. Therefore, if we select the top left selection, we can rename it <code class="literal">SmileBadge_Purple</code>, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_045.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>And we can continue renaming all the selections with the same convention. Once we have finished with all the changes in the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, click the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button in the top right corner, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_046.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you want to abort your changes and start again, next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button, there is the <span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> button. As the name suggests, it reverts all the changes. This button is really useful when we get things completely wrong. For your convenience, it is highlighted in the following screenshot:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_047.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec80"></a>Testing our settings</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, testing that we have selected the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> of the Sprites is easy, because otherwise Unity would have allowed us to drag and drop them in the scene. Once you have placed a sprite in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, Unity creates a new game object with a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> attached, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_048.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> variable is already set with the Sprite we have dragged and dropped.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec23"></a>Testing the packing tag</h4></div></div></div><p>To see if our assets are included in the right package, we can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>. This tool is available only if the Unity mode is set to 2D. We can access it from the top menu bar by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_049.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Once opened, this is how it appears:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_050.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we are not going to go into detail about the different policies of packing, but we use this tool just to see the automatic packages or atlases that Unity did when we were setting our packing tags. In fact, from the top bar of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>, we can select the different atlases that we have in our project. In this case, we have used the <span class="strong"><strong>Badges</strong></span> tag. Therefore, we should see the following in our <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_051.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you are not able to see your pack, it's because Unity didn't pack it yet. To force Unity to pack, just press the <span class="strong"><strong>Pack</strong></span> button in the top left corner, as highlighted in the following screenshot:</p></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_052.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, everything looks good. If, for any reason, you want to create another package tag and see how Unity assembles a new atlas in the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>, feel free to do it. If you want to play with the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span> settings, I suggest that you do it in another project, in order to avoid any inconvenience while we are creating our gamified application here. In fact, the default settings are more than enough for us.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec24"></a>Testing the dimensions of the sprites</h4></div></div></div><p>As you can imagine, there is not a specific tool for testing the dimensions of the sprites, but, just by using the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, we are able to see the dimensions of each Sprite with respect to each other. In fact, this is mainly due the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Per Unit</strong></span> option. Now, to test their dimensions, just bring all of them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_053.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You can just move them around and see if they feel proportional to each other. Of course, what you need to test are the assets into two different sprite sheets. As a result, you can change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Per Unit</strong></span> option to increase (or decrease) their dimensions. The higher the value, the smaller the Sprites will be. In any case, remember that you can always scale single sprites (to be more precise, <span class="emphasis"><em>the single instances of the sprites in the scene</em></span>) as we wish, in order to achieve what we want.</p></div></div></div>
