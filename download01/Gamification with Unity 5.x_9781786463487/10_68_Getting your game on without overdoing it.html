Badges and points are not the answer to all motivational problems, just like gamification is not going to be the magic dust that you have been looking for to fix a broken system. The other consideration is to not think that gamification is like an additional layer to add to an existing system. In some cases, it is possible to integrate the two, so that one system that is already in place blends in with the new gamified approach, but it does require some work.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec119"></a>Understand what gamification is and what it is not</h3></div></div></div><p>Many times, people assume that anything gamified is <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> and that making tests digital is turning them into a game. Unfortunately, both those ideologies are false. For example, transforming multiple choice questions from requiring a student to color in a, b, c, or d on an answer sheet into checkboxes or radio buttons is not making it a game. Gamification is quantifying and acknowledging tasks within a set of rules. How playful it is is up to you. It is not making something digital (for example, written tests to digital ones) and it most certainly does not guarantee that it will be fun. Fun, pleasure, amusement, entertainment, and enjoyment are all relative emotions. To some extent, we all share common activities that we find fun or enjoyable, such as watching a movie, but even then, some people prefer science fiction, and others, comedy. Therefore, it is important to understand the difference between how gaming experiences are fun for us, and how they differ, and that if you think it is fun, it doesn't mean it will be for others. In addition, learn and understand how motivation works and doesn't work. If you want long-term engagement but you're really only facilitating external reinforcement, then you're likely to run into issues.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec120"></a>Kids see through chocolate covered broccoli, and so do adults</h3></div></div></div><p>We all know the term <span class="emphasis"><em>a wolf in sheep's clothing</em></span>, or think that covering vegetables in decadent chocolate will get them to be healthy and, well, kids are a lot more perceptive than we sometimes give them credit for. If you disguise educational content with gameplay, it is likely that they will see through it. This isn't related to children; the same is true with adults. We know that by using a gamified application we intend to monitor our health or spending habits, but it's your job as a designer to make it a little less painful. Therefore, be upfront, transparent, and cut through the <span class="emphasis"><em>disguise</em></span> and focus on the benefits. Of course, kids don't want to be asked to <span class="emphasis"><em>play a game about maths</em></span>, but they are going to be more interested in <span class="emphasis"><em>going on adventures to beat the evil dragon with trigonometry</em></span>. The same goes for adults; creating an awesome character that can be upgraded to a level 80 warrior for remembering to take out the trash, keep hydrated, and eat healthier is a lot better than telling them this is a <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> application to become a better person.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec121"></a>Using gamification in moderation</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating gamified applications, it can be tempting to <span class="emphasis"><em>gamify all the things</em></span>...but don't. If the term gamification is synonymous with badges and points for you, then you have some learning to do. For this reason, a list of different game elements and mechanics are described in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Anatomy of Games</em></span>. Every good gamification designer looks beyond the game's elements and mechanics; they focus on the changes that they want their end user to make.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec122"></a>Getting tangential</h3></div></div></div><p>Gamification allows us to merge games and reality, and this is a perfect opportunity to encourage tangential learning. Tangential learning is planting the <span class="emphasis"><em>seed</em></span> in someone's mind about a topic, that they then on their own go and investigate to learn more about. A perfect example of this is in the game Assassin's Creed. Playing the game, even the series, exposes the player to some historical periods of time, such as the Third Crusade or the American Revolution. Some other games that achieve this are Sid Meier's Civilization series and Portal, as seen in the following screenshots from the game:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/B05686_10_01.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Sid Meier's Civilization V, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.civilization5.com" target="_blank">www.civilization5.com</a>
</p><p>Based on this, an example of the process of tangential learning is presented in the following screenshot. In this example, the user engages with the game Civilization V, and assumes the role of Augustus Caesar:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_10_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>In the case of Portal and Portal 2, the gameplay that allows players to interact using various types of physics such as momentum, acceleration (if you jump into a portal from a high distance), as well as different substances (Portal 2), encourages children to also find out more about them. For example, the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>portals</em></span> in itself is heavily based on a number of different concepts of physics, as well as varying opinions, which is something any student can find out by simplifying exploring search results stemming from a simple search of <span class="emphasis"><em>portal</em></span> in Google. In addition, the different substances that feature in Portal 2 can reduce or create friction, which allows players to complete certain tasks. Something as simple as different substances demonstrates the different effects that they have, which adds another dimension than reading from a text book:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"></a>Note</h3><p>If you're interested in seeing the concept of the sprayable substances, check out the game tag, the power of Paint, here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tinyurl.com/TagTheGame" target="_blank">www.tinyurl.com/TagTheGame</a>

Never underestimate the time that it takes to implement something. Generally, if you need to add a new feature, multiply the estimated amount that it will take by about three. For example, if you think a new level will take one week, set aside three weeks. That way, if something goes wrong, which it can and does, you will have additional time to fix it without being pressed with a deadline. If your deliver earlier than expected, that's great, move on to the next item in the list.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec124"></a>Test it!</h3></div></div></div><p>I really, really, cannot make this point clear enough. Test your game at <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> stage, especially once it becomes digital. Test it on any and every device that you can, and with as many people as possible. Did I mention to test your game? Remember to refer to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Break, Destroy, and Rebuild - the Art of Playtesting and Iteration</em></span>, during the stages of testing to make sure that you're addressing the essentials:</p><p>

Each time you test your game, pay attention to feedback and to the flow of your game. If something doesn't feel right to you, the chances are it won't to your players. Treat each stage of the iterative process as a stage of refinement, like the details being carved into a sculpture. Remember that it is okay to change things at this stage, because it refines your application. If you check out <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Break, Destroy and Rebuild - the Art of Playtesting and Iteration</em></span>, you can find a lot more information about the process in more detail.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec126"></a>Backup...everywhere</h3></div></div></div><p>Backups are right up there next to testing on the broken record of game development. An important lesson I learned from my high school IT teacher was that not only should you backup on a USB, hard drive, cloud, but do it all, more than once and in more than one location!</p><p>What happens if your only backup was on the cloud and then one day, it's gone? Or you only backed up the data on your laptop and then one day it just stopped working? Or, you backed up your project only on external hard drives, but all in the same location and then it all burned down. By now, you should get the point: have multiple backups in different locations, both physical and virtual, and make sure that they all have the most recent files. Having a backup from five months ago on your only functioning backup is not going to be entirely useful a week from your publishing date.</p><p>If backup isn't enough, there are version control tools. These allow you to keep track of the changes in your projects, and branch them, allowing you to work in parallel to then merge them together again. These are really powerful tools; however, it takes a little to enter their logic and set them up properly at the beginning. Unluckily, we don't have time to go in detail in source control tools, but it's worth mentioning that the most commonly used is Git. If you search on Google, you can find different guides that teach you different parts of Git. In any case, there are some free services online to post a repository, and starting to play with them helps you to understand Git better as well. The most famous one is GitHub, and here is a beginner guide: <a class="ulink" href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank">https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/</a>.</p><p>Another thing when it comes to backups is keeping the names of your files consistent. For example, <code class="literal">image_final.png</code> and <code class="literal">image_final_final.png</code> are not ideal ways to let team members and clients know what is the current version. Whether you have an underscore <code class="literal">_</code> or not in your naming convention is also up to you, but if you decide to use them, keep on using them. Lastly, although this goes without saying, keep the names short but meaningful. For example, <code class="literal">image.png</code> is not extremely descriptive, whereas <code class="literal">background_image_login_screen.png</code> is. I have found that naming conventions for a project are best outlined in the GDD. Since it is a shared document, and everyone has to read it, it is the most ideal and central place for team members to refer to during the design process.</p><p>Before we finish our overview of the backup process, here is a list of different tools to get your backups underway, and keep your future self happy if any issues arise:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>USBs and (external) hard drives are the old-school methods of backing up data. They provide you with a physical option for backing up your precious data. Remember, if you only plan on using physical devices, keep a copy of the file on around three different devices, in different (on-site and off-site) locations.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Servers are an option if you have the hardware to create your own or have someone do it for you. It is relatively simple, but if you're planning on it becoming a permanent thing, make sure that it's also a cost-effective venture (remember, servers require electricity and constant up-time). One of the benefits is that you can have a large, secure server just for yourself without the worry of having to pay for additional storage (except if you need to buy a new hard drive for additional space).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dropbox (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">www.dropbox.com</a>) and Google Drive (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.drive.google.com" target="_blank">www.drive.google.com</a>) allow you to back up your data to an online server, providing that you have created an account. In both cases, they offer a generous amount of space to store your files, but if you find that it is not enough, then you will need to purchase more.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec127"></a>Teamwork...play nice</h3></div></div></div><p>Consideration, collaboration, and communication are all important during the game development process. Working environments should be free from the sense of <span class="emphasis"><em>punishment</em></span> of other team members, and to ensure this you need to keep all lines of communication open. While it may seem obvious, a tiny problem such as not knowing how to do something, if communicated early on, reduces stress when everyone is expecting it at a later stage. Game development groups all have different levels of expertise; therefore, we may be capable of many things or a few things. Have this conversation early on so that, there are no assumptions, and so that if a part of the project needs to be outsourced, it can be done and on time. If you can't do something, it is fine, but don't over-promise and under-deliver.</p><p>One way to visualize your work schedule is with a <span class="strong"><strong>Gantt Chart</strong></span>, such as in the following figure. In this way, members of the team can see processes that can be done in parallel with each other, and ones that may require the completion of another before starting:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_10_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>An example of a Gantt Chart using Microsoft Excel's (https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msin/en_GB/pdp/Excel-2016/productID.324412900) Gantt Chart template</p><p>Now that the lines of communication are open, keep in mind that people have lives outside your project. Sometimes it is easy to be so focused on the end goal that we forget this. In other cases, we have more time than others and assume that they are also free to work. However, the programmer in your group, he may have a newborn, a mortgage to pay off, and work a second job; therefore, asking him to commit his entire weekend to the project at the last minute is probably not going to end well. So, be mindful that unless everyone is <span class="emphasis"><em>full-time</em></span> on your project, and maintaining a steady income because of it, you need work around each other. Another consideration is also the tasks that are being implemented. In some cases, they are small, quick things that take a few hours to complete; others may be more complicated, and even the most competent person struggles with them. Therefore, unless you have a team with experienced experts in your team, keep this in mind.</p></div></div>
