Now, what productivity is related to is relative, so ultimately feel free to associate it with anything from house chores to arriving at work on time. We are leaving it pretty open-ended so it is possible to target various types of productivity and not any single one in particular. It might even be useful to create a mind map such as the following figure to get some ideas flowing. Remember to include any thoughts that you have, because we can fine tune it later:</p><p>

</p><p>For now, if you can't think of some interesting ideas for your application, I encourage you to go through the previous chapters. For example, maybe it is worth going through some Pinterest boards to look for some cool ideas to create a fitness application. Maybe you already have an idea but would like to create it in a particular way, so it's just a matter of organizing your thoughts. You might even need some help with ways to incorporate game design, and for this I encourage you to play with existing applications to get a feel for different approaches. Therefore, I recommend that you play and play often. Also, as you think of ideas, write them down, sketch them; even rough ideas all help in the later stages of the development. The following are some sketches of the earlier development for the design of this book's application:</p><p>

</p><p>Examples of the application's profile (left) and dashboard (right)</p><p>The following figure indicates how a user is able to set a task date within the application. You can see that both the task set date menu (left) and the main menu item <span class="strong"><strong>tasks</strong></span> (right) are featured within the image. Again, these are just the initial stages of design, and we will refine them as we go:</p><p>
