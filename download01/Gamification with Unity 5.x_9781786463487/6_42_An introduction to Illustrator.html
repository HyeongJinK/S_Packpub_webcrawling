It looks pretty empty, but there are a few essentials that we will need to set up before we begin making our icons:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>One thing to do is to open a few new windows that will be useful later on. They are highlighted in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The following are the uses of the highlighted menu options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Align </strong></span>basically allows us to align and distribute the objects within our scene evenly. This is particularly useful when you want to achieve an effect, such as a striped pattern. It also helps if you want to center objects within your scene either to the objects that you have selected or to your Artboard. You can think of your Artboard as the canvas that you are painting on:</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Appearance</strong></span> is responsible for the special effects that we will add later, such as drop shadow or outer glow. This window makes it easier to edit the settings or to remove them from our objects:</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Layers </strong></span>are the different parts of the scene. Think of them as sheets that are stacked on top of one another. The layer on the bottom will be behind all the other objects that are on top of it:</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pathfinder</strong></span> (note the shortcut as well) is useful for when we want to merge, add, or subtract shapes from one another:</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_011.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Swatches </strong></span>are palettes of different colors that we can choose from for this project:</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_012.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now that we have opened these windows, it is time to create the project. Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_013.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You will be presented with a screen, as shown in the following screenshot, that asks you to create the dimensions of your document. Since we will be creating the background for an application, we will need to assign the following dimensions: 1,080 x 1,920 pixels (or px, which is an abbreviated term, just like cm and mm). The rest of the settings can be left the same; just make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Color Mode</strong></span> is set to <span class="strong"><strong>RGB</strong></span> since we will not be printing it, but viewing it on a screen! Lastly, give it a name, and click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_014.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, you should have something that looks like the following screenshot. Feel free to rearrange the windows as you want. Make sure, once you have done this, to save your document, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. Keep the settings as they are and save it in a suitable location:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_015.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now that you have the <span class="emphasis"><em>size</em></span> of your application set, we can begin to create the different elements. We will do this within this document so that as we are designing we get a better feel for the size, proportion, and their appearance on screen and within the application's dimensions.</p><p>The document setup is pretty straightforward. Once you get used to what everything does and where everything is, the design process will flow a lot faster. Remember that all the windows that we have opened can be moved around so that they are located in places that are more comfortable for you to work with.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec74"></a>Creating badges in Illustrator</h3></div></div></div><p>As we have already discussed in this book, there are many different ways to create icons within any graphics program. So, choose the program that meets your needs and the one that you are most comfortable with. For the following examples, and for the creation of assets within this book, we will use Adobe Illustrator. We will explore a few different ways to achieve the same thing that cater to both novices and advanced users.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_016.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Different icons that are used within the application for this book</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec21"></a>Getting all rounded</h4></div></div></div><p>There are two ways to go about creating rounded corners in Illustrator. One is a redefined shape, the other is an effect. Rounded corners are a nice way to add subtle effects to the overall aesthetic of a UI. They can make things feel less rigid than just using straight edges, and there are many different ways to go about it. We will discuss two ways for creating rounded corners in this section: using the <span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span> tool, which is presented in the following screenshot, or we can create rounded corners by using an <span class="emphasis"><em>effect</em></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl4sec7"></a>Using the Shape tool</h5></div></div></div><p>For us to begin creating images, we must first select the <span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span> tool, which is located in the <span class="strong"><strong>toolbox</strong></span> menu on the left-hand side in Illustrator. To view more options, simply drag the mouse's cursor over the <span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span> tool, and a small selection screen should appear, as in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_017.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Click anywhere in the scene, and then a pop-up box should appear, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_018.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Set the values for the size of the square (or rectangle). If you want the size to be equal on both sides, make sure that the link on the right is selected. If you want to make a rectangle, deselect it. Lastly, enter the amount that you want your corners to be <span class="emphasis"><em>rounded</em></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Corner Radius</strong></span>; we will use 50 px. Once you are happy, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. You should have something that looks like the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_019.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, if you want to scale the square up or down, you can do so without creating any distortion, as seen in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_020.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The square has been enlarged (left), original image (center), the square has been made smaller (right)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl4sec8"></a>Using the effect</h5></div></div></div><p>I recommend using the <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> option to achieve rounded corners, mainly because it is less complicated to edit later if you decide that you want your edges to be more or less rounded than they already are. In addition, it also makes it easier to adjust the corners when you are scaling the object up or down.</p><p>First of all, you will need to create an object. For this example, we will create a pink square, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_021.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Next, select your square, go to the top menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Stylize</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Round Corners...</strong></span>. You can see this in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_022.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You will see a pop-up menu appear, as shown in the following screenshot, that needs us to enter in a number to determine how <span class="emphasis"><em>round</em></span> our corners will be. Make sure that you check <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> so that you can see the effect as you experiment. Choose a value that you are comfortable with, and then click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_023.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now you should have a nice rounded square:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_024.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>However, it is important to keep in mind that as you scale the image up or down, the <span class="emphasis"><em>roundness</em></span> of the edges will change. An example of this can be seen in the following figure:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_025.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The square has been enlarged (left), original image (center), the square has been made smaller (right)</p><p>However, you are able to edit the corners in the the <span class="strong"><strong>Appearance</strong></span> window. We can see the option to edit the <span class="strong"><strong>Rounded Corners</strong></span> in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_026.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Double-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rounded corners</strong></span> option and a pop-up box will appear, as shown in the following screenshot. Make sure <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> is selected and then adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span> to what you want:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_027.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec22"></a>Showing the best of you with badges</h4></div></div></div><p>Now that we know how to create a rounded square, we will need to create four, which we will use in the application later. To begin, create a new document, and call it <code class="literal">Badges</code>.</p><p>Next, we will need to create four <span class="strong"><strong>Artboards</strong></span>. First, click on the Artboard icon in the toolbox menu, identified as number <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span> in the following screenshot. Next, change the height and width to <code class="literal">50 px</code>, identified as number <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span> in the following screenshot. Lastly, change the name of the Artboard, identified as number <span class="strong"><strong>3</strong></span>, to something useful, such as <code class="literal">task_badge</code>, or whatever name suits your needs:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_028.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Create a rounded corner square and place it in the middle of the Artboard, as shown in the following screenshot. Feel free to choose any colors that you wish:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_029.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Once we have done all this, it is time to create a simple star icon. You can do this by clicking and holding on the shape icon in the toolbox and then selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Star</strong></span> shape, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_030.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Simply drag your mouse to create your star and then color it as you wish. We chose a golden yellow:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_031.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, you are free to create any type of icon. They don't even have to be rounded corners; just let your imagination guide you.</p><p>Next, we need to export the badge so that it's ready to use in Unity. To do this, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_032.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Make sure you give your file a name, that <span class="strong"><strong>Use Artboards</strong></span> is selected, and that you select the file type as <code class="literal">.png</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_033.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, change the resolution to <span class="strong"><strong>Screen (72 ppi)</strong></span> and make sure that the background color is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Transparent</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot. Once you are done, click <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_034.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec75"></a>Aiming above the bar</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different purposes that bars can serve in a game, from displaying progress to health. They can be in various shapes and forms, just like in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_035.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>A simple way to create one is using similar techniques to what we did previously with the badge. We can create a rectangle, using either method (<span class="strong"><strong>Shape Tool</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Effect</strong></span>). Then, we can add different shapes to indicate a segment of progression. We can also add a gradient if we want to! To add segments, it is just a matter of creating smaller squares or rectangles that are smaller than the bar itself and then aligning and distributing them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec76"></a>Putting it all together with sprite sheets</h3></div></div></div><p>Creating sprite sheets is a pretty simple process. Sprite sheets are like the sticker sheets that you got when you were a kid. However, in a game context, they can contain every frame of a character's animation, or parts of the UI layout, in such a way that a designer can cut them up and use them within Unity. You can find many online guides to do this, but one of the simplest ways to do this is to create a large Artboard and then copy your icons (once they are finished). Make sure that each element of the icon (such as background, icon image, and so on) are grouped. You can do this by selecting all of the components in the image and then pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl + G</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>cmd</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span>
 for Mac Os). Once you have your icons on the Artboard and in a group, align, and then distribute them so that the sprite sheet is organized. An example is in the following figure:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_036.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>We can export this as a unique sheet named <code class="literal">badges-sheet</code>.</p><p>So far, we have seen how to create our assets. In the next sections, we will explore how we can properly import them into Unity in order to achieve exactly what we want.</p></div></div>
