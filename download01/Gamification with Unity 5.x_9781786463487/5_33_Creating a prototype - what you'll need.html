Of course, these are suggestions; there are many, many different ways to create prototypes. For now, use the information on the following pages as a primer, a set of training wheels, until you start to get used to the development process. Make sure that you have some of the items shown in the following image so you can get all the ideas out onto paper!</p><p>

</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec53"></a>Gathering your humans</h3></div></div></div><p>The first thing you will need are people to create the prototype. People come in many shapes, forms, talents, and so on, so you want a great bunch of cool people to work with. Even if it's just yourself, that's fine too. The main thing here is to be <span class="emphasis"><em>crystal clear</em></span> about what each person in the development process is responsible for. For example, you might have two programmers in your group, which is great. But make it clear that programmer #1 is responsible for implementing the UI and programmer #2 is responsible for the database. If people have a clear idea of their purpose, they spend less time trying to figure it out, and in the long run, the development of the prototype can be more efficient.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec54"></a>Having a plan!</h3></div></div></div><p>You now have a group, but before you start getting into developing the initial prototype, think about <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> you want, and <span class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span> you want it done by. Ask yourself questions such as what does the prototype need to include, and how are you going to evaluate the success of it? A prototype answers a question about the game. For example, is it to test the effectiveness of adding additional weapons, or whether or not the player needs to have certain information presented to them all the time during gameplay? Of course, these are basic questions, and games can have more than one question that the prototype needs to answer. The main point here is that there <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a question that lays down the whole point of the prototype.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"></a>Setting a date</h3></div></div></div><p>This is one of the most important resources of game development. Do you have a day, a couple of weeks, or a few months to create the prototype? You need to set a number of dates. You will need a start and finish date, but also milestones, feature freezes (when no more features are added to prototype). If, during the process, you find that you are running out of time, need more time, or even finish earlier than expected, ask yourself why. If you need more time, what is the reason? Is it because something isn't working, or is it because there are too many things to implement within the timeframe? The same can also be said for if you finish early. Reflect on each part and whether or not it answers the questions, or even if it raises more.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec56"></a>Scoping it out</h3></div></div></div><p>What do you need to build, and what <span class="emphasis"><em>is possible</em></span> within the limits of the initial prototype? Will you create a demo level with different functionalities that the player will have throughout the game? Is the prototype a preliminary version of a level or part of a level? What needs to be included or excluded to determine if it is valuable to the end product? During the process, it is easy to get lost among it all and think of a cool feature and then begin to implement it. If this happens, then STOP. Review the plan, and only add the essentials. This super cool feature that you want to add now can be done later, if it is still relevant to the overall game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec57"></a>Keeping it short and to the point</h3></div></div></div><p>Keeping it to the point and not <span class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span> is what you need to keep in mind throughout the whole process. Make it your mantra and don't get attached! One of the worst things that can happen when you're creating a game is that you get attached to an idea that you really like. As a result, you develop something with <span class="emphasis"><em>tunnel vision</em></span> and tend to avoid new and even better ideas from developing because they somehow impinge on your <span class="emphasis"><em>best idea ever</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec58"></a>What's your poison?</h3></div></div></div><p>This is basically what kind of platform you will use to create your prototype, and what device you will ultimately design on, such as those in the following image. Ideally, if you go digital with a game engine (and other software), you will want to use the one that you will eventually develop in. This is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to say that while you are creating your prototype, you should spend hours to perfect it so that it can be used later in the game. It <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> to say that by using the software, while also keeping in mind the target device(s) that you will use for the final product, you will become more familiar with the tools and processes, and an overall sense of how the software works:</p><p>

You can begin with a theme, even restrict yourself to tools for creating a prototype. You can even think of a game jam like a concentrated approach to prototyping. In this case, you dedicate a specific amount of time, which is generally short, to developing a game. Typically, these can last from 24-48 hours, and by the end, you have something rough but functioning. From this point, you can refine it. Just be sure to bring plenty of snacks, beverages, and wear something comfy. It's going to be a long night!</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"></a>Tip</h3><p>Each year, all around the world many game jams are held with various themes and purposes. One of these is the Global Game Jam, <a class="ulink" href="http://globalgamejam.org" target="_blank">globalgamejam.org</a>. Game jams are a great way to get a feel for the overall prototyping and game design process. So, a great tip is to check out ones that are close to you and join in on the fun. It's also a great way to not only develop your game development skills, but also your network, and to most importantly to have fun! Another great example aside from the Global Game Jam is Ludum Dare, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ludumdare.com" target="_blank">www.ludumdare.com</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec60"></a>Failing is an option</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't worry if you don't get it right from the beginning. Chances are you won't in any case. So, expect to fail and expect it often. This may sound like some harsh words, but ultimately, if we got it perfect the first time around then prototyping would be redundant. So, go crazy, take risks, be bold, and most importantly, experiment!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec61"></a>Touching base</h3></div></div></div><p>Just because everyone in the group agreed to the timeline and the work doesn't mean that it will be done and on time. This can happen for various reasons: life issues pop up, things are harder than anticipated, and so forth. Keep the communication lines open when developing a prototype, and the chances are that as the deadline is drawing closer, so is the prototype. Don't be afraid to admit you don't know how to do something that you have been assigned or agreed to do. Sitting there doing nothing is not going to make it any easier when it's a week out from the finish line and you haven't done anything, than saying something right from the beginning.</p></div></div>
