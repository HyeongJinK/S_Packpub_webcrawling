There are so many different resources available that extend what you have learned in this book as well as how to apply them. Here is a list of ways that you can go about extending your knowledge.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip46"></a>Tip</h3><p>As a game design exercise, try using different techniques that have been described in this book to develop ideas to the previous suggestions within each context.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec134"></a>Become a researcher</h3></div></div></div><p>You don't need a degree to research. Believe it or not, there are a lot of papers that are available that talk about new and innovative ways of creating game-like experiences. Not just papers, but conferences can also be great ways to get your game noticed too, especially if you're targeting areas such as STEM learning or health. They can be a bit expensive (in some cases, conference fees alone can range from $100-$600) depending on when, where, and how long they run for. However, if you have the opportunity to, they are definitely worthwhile. In some cases, conferences actually have a section dedicated to game development where you can submit your game. A great place to start finding useful papers is Google Scholar scholar.google.com, and a great place to find current and future game conferences is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gameconfs.com" target="_blank">http://www.gameconfs.com</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec135"></a>Make design a daily habit</h3></div></div></div><p>Go out right now, take this book with you, and find or buy a notebook. This will become your game design journal, for anything and everything game-related. Try and make a habit of writing down some game ideas every day, perhaps during breakfast, lunch, coffee break, or before you go to bed. This will become like a repository later when you might need some inspiration. There may be a part of a current game that you are designing that doesn't quite work, but something that you thought about, say, last week, can be the missing link. No idea is a bad idea; they all become useful at some point.</p><p>Another great idea is to make a list of all the games that you like. This list can be as large as you want it to be, and for each game, write a sentence about what you like and didn't like about the game. That way, when you reflect on these comments at a later stage, you can begin to mix ideas together. For example, what you didn't like in one game might complement something in another, and so on.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec69"></a>Redesigning your favorite games as board games</h4></div></div></div><p>This activity I have done myself a number of times, and it actually gets you thinking and focusing on gameplay. The one thing that I admire about board games is that you cannot mask their gameplay with beautiful graphics, or amazing orchestral soundtracks (of course, you can play music in the background, though!) Breaking down games into parts, seeing how those parts interact with each other and how to represent them in a physical form, such as stones, counters, and so forth, will help you to gain a really good understanding of gameplay, and it's a fun process to do!</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec136"></a>Never. Stop. Learning</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't think that reading any one or number of books, or watching any number of tutorials will give you everything that you need to know. Each day, we are presented with new technologies, new methodologies, and as these become the latest trends, there are a bunch of researchers developing the technologies of tomorrow. Be sure to check the latest news on gamification both at a concept and its implementation within varying environments. As technology changes, so do the ways that people do things.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec137"></a>Play to win and play to explore</h3></div></div></div><p>Now you have a legitimate excuse to game, which is <span class="emphasis"><em>to learn</em></span>. By playing many different games across many different genres, you will not only be exposed to many different approaches that you can use for your own designs, but you will learn how to use them. There is more than one way to drink water, and there is definitely more than one way to give and get a badge. If you don't have a lot of time to play hour intense games, check out the latest mobile games, but whichever way you game, make sure you keep it in moderation and consistent.</p><p>What might also be worthwhile is to keep a game journal. In this journal, you can write about your experiences with games. What did you like/didn't you like? Was there something in particular that stood out that could be useful or even applied in a different way? You can also include color schemes, comments about music, and even the aesthetic style; include anything and everything that you find relevant. Remember that there is no right or wrong way to do it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"></a>Note</h3><p>A great web series that I recommend that you have a look at is the Extra Credits series. They discuss a whole range of topics related to games. You can find their videos here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec138"></a>Read game guides</h3></div></div></div><p>While game guides are typically there to help you, you can definitely learn a thing or two about game design. While you are reading, pay attention to <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> players are expected to achieve certain tasks. Even if game guides are directed towards typical games and not necessarily gamified applications per se, it is possible to abstract them to gamified applications. The way that tasks are designed, how they reward the player can all be used to improve the implementation of the same or similar game elements into your application.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec139"></a>Participate, compete, and get together</h3></div></div></div><p>There is a large range of gaming events, both local and around the world. Game jams are a great example of the participatory culture that games can offer. Some are short and last one day; others are long and last two or three days. But get involved and get in and amongst the community. Other opportunities such as meetups (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">www.meetup.com</a>), game conventions, and conferences such as the Game Developer's Conference (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gdconf.com" target="_blank">www.gdconf.com</a>), expos such as the EB Games Expo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ebexpo.com.au/" target="_blank">www.ebexpo.com.au</a>), Penny Arcade Expo (PAX, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.paxsite.com" target="_blank">www.paxsite.com</a> ) and South by Southwest (SxSW, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sxsw.com" target="_blank">www.sxsw.com</a>), and so forth, all offer other great opportunities to connect with other developers, gamers, and even an opportunity to showcase your work.</p></div></div>
