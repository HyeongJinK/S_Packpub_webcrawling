Therefore, this chapter introduces a series of tools to get you creating a physical prototype of your application. At this stage, the reader will get an idea about how to test the application with its target audience so that they avoid wasting time and programming resources later in the process. This will also extend what you have done in <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, Organized Chaos - Getting Ideas Out of Your Head and on to Paper</em></span>, but adding more functionalities.</p><p>The list of topics that will be covered in this chapter are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>At the beginning of this chapter,<span class="emphasis"><em> Creating a Game Design Document </em></span>looks at creating a document that explains your game in more detail. The idea of this document is to provide a guide to you and other members of your team during the development process. It is also useful when trying to contain the scope of the overall project during not only the development but also prototyping and iterative stages.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next,<span class="emphasis"><em> Creating a prototype - what you'll need </em></span>will look at a range of considerations that need to be made during the prototype stage and how they all affect the design of your prototype and future development of your game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will then look at<span class="emphasis"><em> Methods of prototyping</em></span>, which examines how to create a prototype based on two popular methods--rapid and paper prototyping.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In the penultimate section,<span class="emphasis"><em> Tools for prototyping in Unity</em></span> explores the different features of Unity that allow us to easily and quickly set up a prototype of our game or application. Which we will then learn how to implement in <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting basic core concepts into Unity</em></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Lastly, we will conclude this chapter with <span class="emphasis"><em>Revising the prototype</em></span>, which explains how to revise the final prototype and how to test, iterate, and then take it further.</p></li></ul></div></div>
