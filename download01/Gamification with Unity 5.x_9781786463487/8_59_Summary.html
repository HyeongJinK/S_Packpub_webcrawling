This includes deciding what you want out of your playtest, where to playtest, and what to ask your playtesters. Then, we looked at how to take this information and use it to improve your game or application. Finally, we learned what data persistence is within our application and how to use <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> to save data. Furthermore, we learned why databases are important for playtesting, how to install them, and how to use PlayFab to store our data in an online database.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will wrap up everything we did as part of the project. We will make sure that the project is ready to be published and that you have all of the necessary skills to get it to the final stage.</p></div>
