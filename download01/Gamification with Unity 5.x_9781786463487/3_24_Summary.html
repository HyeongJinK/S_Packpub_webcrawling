Next, we looked at how we can encourage the player and indicate their progress with different types of feedback, both in visual and audio ways, to indicate to the player right and wrong actions. Then, we learned how to implement various game elements in Unity, such as health indicators (a circular health bar and a lives counter), progress bars, badges, and points. After this, we looked at gamification dashboards, their design, and their overall objective. Lastly, we discussed what it means to work with agile gamification and keeping a team motivated.</p><p>Overall, in this chapter, we have seen how to create different game elements that can be reused (and we will reuse them in the next chapters). We have also used some of the knowledge acquired from the first two chapters to better understand and create these game elements.</p><p>In the next chapter (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, Organized Chaos - Getting Ideas Out of Your Head and on to Paper</em></span>), we will be looking at creating the application that we'll focus on during the rest of the book. We begin by learning how to effectively brainstorm ideas, get them out of your head into a more organized and coherent idea, refine them, and finally get something happening in Unity.</p></div>
