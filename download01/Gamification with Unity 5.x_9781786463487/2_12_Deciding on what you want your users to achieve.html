<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"></a>Deciding on what you want your users to achieve</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Consider the following points to determine the end goal for your users:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Aim</strong></span>: The aim of what you want your players to achieve at the end. For example, the aim of your gaming experience may be to increase productivity within users. Ultimately, without a clear aim you can begin to ask what the point of the experience is and why you are designing it. If you are unsure about your aim, chances are the player will be as well.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Objectives</strong></span>: The list of objectives includes different actions that the user must perform to achieve the listed outcomes. These can be anything from finding items, rescuing a princess, and so forth. Some objectives may be hidden and only revealed to the player after certain conditions have been met, such as unlockables. For example, an objective in a language application might be to learn grammar rules and punctuation.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Outcomes</strong></span>: The list of outcomes extends from the aim. For example, for increasing productivity, an outcome involves being more time-efficient. Outcomes may include being able to speak in a new language with a higher level of fluency than when they began.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span>: Set of guidelines that the user can and cannot do. Rules can be as strict or as open as you want. But make sure that they are clear and that they work. If a player is engaging with your game, you want to make sure that things are black and white. Obviously, any shades of gray are where the player can exploit your system and this can end in all kinds of problems. An important thing to keep in mind once you have begun designing your rules is to play-test them. The same goes for each additional rule that you implement.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Getting the player to achieve it</h3></div></div></div><p>The type of motivation that a designer wants to facilitate is an important consideration. For example, users can be intrinsically drawn into an experience because they find it interesting without any need for a reward (for example, learning about the history of various civilizations). In contrast, some users may engage with a system purely for the external benefits that it offers (for example, more discounts when they are shopping). If these external rewards are removed, they will disengage. Therefore, finding the right balance between these two, or better yet identifying the type of motivation and designing for it, can be useful. Consequently, it can optimize the experience for the user as well as increasing the longevity of the application for the designer.</p><p>One of the most important questions to ask yourself is if it is necessary to reward them for the action, whatever it may be. Like we discussed in <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, The Anatomy of Games</em></span>, too many rewards can create a dependency, too little then they might lose interest; too much of something that they already like might just kill their motivation entirely.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Engaging the player</h3></div></div></div><p>As we already mentioned, motivating the player is important if we want to keep them engaged. Motivation isn't just about points but also about providing things that they like in a way that isn't repetitive, but also enough to keep them coming back for more. Three things to consider are in the following list, as well as how they are, and could be, used in your gaming experience; and ultimately taking account of what the short-term and long-term effects are. All have their pro's and con's, so it's about finding out what suits your game and overall approach.</p><p>When it comes to motivation, we can think of two main types of motivation, extrinsic and intrinsic. Both can influence the way that you can design a gamified experience and the effect that it will have on the end user. In the following list, each is described in a bit more detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Extrinsic</strong></span>: Here is where you want to think about the amount of focus that you will have on the external elements that will motivate your user. To put it simply, extrinsic motivation is the lollies that you offer to a child to clean their room. In relation to the design of your gamified experience, one of the questions at this stage that you will want to think about is are the rewards and feedback that you are providing to the player based on predominantly extrinsic motivation? For example, if you want to reward your player for achieving an objective, is the objective an important one (maintaining a healthy diet for seven consecutive days) or a general one (opening the application on a regular basis). If it's an important one, it is ideal that you give it some attention, either by providing the user with points or a simple acknowledgement such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Great Work</em></span>. Ultimately, how much attention that you allocate is up to you, but keep in mind the impact of rewards and feedback. Some examples may include giving points each time a particular action(s) is performed, but keep in mind that if a player becomes too reliant on points, then it can become an issue in the long term.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Intrinsic</strong></span>: The reason that a user is engaging with your application is more than likely because they want to. Therefore, they are intrinsically motivated. At this stage this is fantastic, you have them there, now let's keep it that way! Some examples could be relating rewards back to their success in a meaningful way. For example, if your application can see that they make more attempts to complete something, the feedback provided once they have finished the task should be encouraging: <span class="emphasis"><em>Sticking through the hard times has paid off! Bonus 50 points!</em></span>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Schedules</strong></span>: The intervals at which events/rewards, and so on, occur are known as schedules. For example, if a user receives a badge once a week for continuing their interaction, then the badge becomes a weekly occurrence. There are two ways that you can offer rewards, scheduled intervals and ratios:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Intervals</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Ratios</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Intervals are further categorized into fixed and variable interval reward schedules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fixed</strong></span>: Interval reward schedules provide a reward after a certain amount of time has elapsed. For example, after 10 seconds, the player is given a bonus. This can work when you're trying to engage the player for a short period of time; after a longer period of time using fixed intervals, the player's engagement will tend to decrease.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Variable</strong></span>: Interval reward schedules provide a reward after a relatively consistent amount of time. Because this isn't completely consistent, it can keep the player engaged for longer because it is unclear exactly when a reward will be provided. This can provide tension depending on what will be provided after the time has elapsed. The player can estimate the likelihood, but it also decreases the chances for the novelty of rewards to wear off. For example, after roughly one hour a new boss enemy will appear with bountiful rewards for the player to receive once it has been defeated. In such cases, the first in best dressed can be a great way to encourage competition if rewards are single instance per interval.</p></li></ul></div><p>Just like intervals, Ratio is also categorized into fixed and variable ratio reward schedules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fixed</strong></span>: Ratio reward schedules provide rewards after a fixed number of actions have been performed. This is particularly useful when you want players to work towards achieving things such as levels and even status. For example, if you complete 10 tasks consecutively during the week, then you get points towards your progress, if the player fails to achieve this, then they are not rewarded.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Variable</strong></span>: Ratio reward schedules provide rewards after a roughly consistent number of unknown actions has been performed. The benefit of using variable ratio schedules is that the player doesn't know exactly what will happen next, maintaining an element of mystery. This can encourage the player to engage more with the game or application. An example may be if players are exploring lands within a game; exploring ones that are a considerable distance from the mainland (thus requiring more time from the player) is rewarded with a badge.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec15"></a>Getting loopy about engagement</h4></div></div></div><p>Think about the cycle that a user goes through as they experience your application. Where does it begin and what happens along the way until it begins again? What is the player's journey through your designed gamified experience? Is it infinite like a daily fitness application or is there a definite end such as learning a mathematics topic? In any case, whether infinite or not, there are two types of loop: engagement and progression loops, which players will experience during the gamified experience. These are discussed in the following section.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec2"></a>Engagement loops</h5></div></div></div><p>They target the micro level of an experience such as the user's actions. These types of loop are used to provide a user with the motivation to perform various actions that are required:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Motivation</strong></span>: Like we discussed before, motivation is what initially brings the user to play your game or application and keeps them engaged <span class="emphasis"><em>or not</em></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Action</strong></span>: This is what we get the player <span class="emphasis"><em>to do</em></span> during the experience in order for them to progress.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Feedback</strong></span>: Providing feedback is extremely important because it indicates to the player how they are going. It can also help them in terms of their level of motivation and their type.</p></li></ul></div><p>The idea with engagement loops is that each stage feeds back into the next like a cycle, as in the following figure:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/B05686_02_03.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Engagement loop</p><p>To summarize, once a user has performed the action, they are provided with feedback. Feedback can be given in a number of ways from points to badges. Once a user receives these rewards, they can often act as a trigger for boosting the user's motivation. An example of this is when a player completes a task such as staying hydrated, where they get points, and they can then buy or upgrade parts of the game, and then begin the cycle again. At a smaller level, progression loops break this process down into chunks.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec3"></a>Progression loops</h5></div></div></div><p>We can think of progression loops as the overall experience, which may be quite overwhelming in the beginning, and break it down into chunks, or smaller challenges, where each chunk is a step that moves a user from the beginning to the end. Primarily, the first challenge for any new player is to learn the rules and how the game works, and ultimately to find their purpose amongst it all. Then, as they progress, they are provided with challenges that vary and increase with difficulty. This also provides the player with a greater sense of accomplishment and greater satisfaction when they reflect on how far they have come. A basic progressive loop can be seen in the following figure:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/B05686_02_04.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Progression loop</p><p>Any journey begins with a single step, and in a gamified system this step can begin with a user. Each user will have a profile, which can be general or detailed depending on the intention of the system and how a profile relates to it. Profiles allow users to carve their identify within the gamified landscape. They are sometimes fictional, alter-egos, other times they are true representations of ourselves. As we are about to learn, setting up a profile system in Unity is a feature that any gamified experience can include to make the experience more personalized for its users.</p></div></div></div></div>
