In addition, we looked at what programs to use to create it. Next, we looked at what we need to create a prototype and how to create one. We looked at the different considerations that needed to be covered before beginning a prototype and two popular methods of prototyping known as <span class="emphasis"><em>paper prototyping</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>rapid prototyping</em></span>. Lastly, we looked at tools for prototyping in Unity and revising the prototype, while getting the basic core concepts into Unity. In <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, Breathing Life into Your First Creation - Making It Digital!</em></span>, we will begin by going over the project that will be developed throughout the remainder of this book. We will set up the project in Unity and implement some features that we have learned about in previous chapters and integrate them with some new features.</p></div>
