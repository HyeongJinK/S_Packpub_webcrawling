It will guide the reader through various tools and shortcuts in Adobe Illustrator (which can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.adobe.com/in/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">www.adobe.com/in/products/illustrator.html</a>) to create each icon. You should keep in mind that Illustrator takes a little time to get used to; therefore, it is worthwhile checking out some basic tutorials to get you started.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip25"></a>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that if you are not able to use Illustrator (or some of the alternative software proposed later), you can always find the graphics you need for this book at <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com" target="_blank">player26.com</a>.</p><p>In any case, creating your own graphics adds a personal touch to your application. For this reason, I suggest you at least try to follow the next sections and experiment with the graphics, even if this is your first time.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec72"></a>Adobe Illustrator</h3></div></div></div><p>Illustrator is a software developed by Adobe Systems and it is used to manipulate <span class="strong"><strong>Vector Graphics</strong></span>:</p><p>

</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"></a>Note</h3><p>However, there are some free alternatives to Illustrator, such as InkScape (<a class="ulink" href="https://inkscape.org/en/" target="_blank">https://inkscape.org/en/</a>) or Affinity Designer (<a class="ulink" href="https://affinity.serif.com" target="_blank">https://affinity.serif.com</a>). Feel free to choose the one you prefer.</p></div><p>Since we are only going to use basic functionalities, we don't need to have a specific version of any of these programs. In any case, if you can, get the last version of the software that you are going to use.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec73"></a>Vector graphics</h3></div></div></div><p>If you don't know what a vector image is, continue reading this section; otherwise, feel free to skip it.</p><p>The concept of an image that you are most likely used to is the one made out of pixels. These can have different colors, and all of them together create an image. This method is perfect for representing very complex shapes, such as human bodies. In fact, photos are made of pixels. However, the main problem is that they cannot be scaled without losing quality. On the other hand, vector images are not made of pixels, but mathematical formulas/functions that represent the objects. An example of these differences is shown in the following figure:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_06_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, the computer can keep computing those functions to whatever scale you want, without reducing the quality. The best part is that in order to create vector images, you don't need any math skills; this process is completely handled by the computer. The downside is that it is difficult to represents complex shapes such as human bodies.</p><p>So, in saying all of this, if your graphics are made out of geometric shapes (such as triangles, polygons, and so on) or a combination of them, vector images are for sure the best choice. One of the common uses of vector images is for logos.</p><p>For these reasons, we are going to use vector images in this chapter.</p></div></div>
