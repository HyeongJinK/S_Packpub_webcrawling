We will suggest ways to test, what to look for, and what to pay attention to during this stage. We will learn about these and a few other things along the way in the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin,<span class="emphasis"><em> Playtesting </em></span>will describe the basics of developing your playtest, from types of playtesting to who you need to test your application.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>Methods of play testing - game time </em></span>will explain how to go about your playtest and various things that need to be taken into account both before and after you have finished testing.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Now that our application has reached the final stages, <span class="emphasis"><em>After the game </em></span>will cover what to do once you have finished playtesting and how to use the information as part of the iterative process.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>After reflecting on the feedback from playtesting, <span class="emphasis"><em>Iteration </em></span>will explain the iteration process and the main cycle used in this book to iterate.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Before concluding this chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>Data persistence in our application </em></span>covers the concept of data persistence and different ways to achieve it in Unity. As a result, the application won't restart from scratch at every launch.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Lastly, <span class="emphasis"><em>Connecting the application to a database </em></span>will explain how to connect Unity to a database for persistent data storage in order to collect data easier for playtesting and further analysis.</p></li></ul></div></div>
