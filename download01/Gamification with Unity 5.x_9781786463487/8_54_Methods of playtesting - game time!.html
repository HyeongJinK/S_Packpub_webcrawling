Ask them questions such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Why did you do that?</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Do you understand the rules or is it confusing?</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Did you expect that to happen?</em></span>. Getting feedback at these crucial moments can let you know whether the game is being played and understood as it should be. Of course, you need to keep in mind what you want information about, as the preceding questions are very general. This is a good place to begin, but as the testing develops you will want to ask more specific questions, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Did you feel more motivated when you received a badge?</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Is it tedious having to select from a large array of options?</em></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec94"></a>Observing how testers are playing</h3></div></div></div><p>While testers are interacting with your game, observe <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> they are doing it, just like in the following screenshot. Do they engage in a particular way that is not intended? This may demonstrate that you have some glitches in your experience that could even be exploited. For example, if players are able to find ways around certain elements to get more points, obtain badges, and so forth, you will need to revise. The same can be said for the reverse, if players are supposed to obtain something but they don't, or the game won't allow them to progress. At these points, players may find the game boring because of a technical issue.</p><p>

This will also help you to focus your questions, whether it is in a survey or in an interview. The importance of this is that you don't want to have too much general information if you are testing a particular part of your game or application.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec96"></a>During the playtest</h3></div></div></div><p>Depending on how long you will have playtesters engaged with your game, it may be ideal to take breaks. This is also a good opportunity to get some feedback along the way. For example, perhaps there is a particular part of the game that they are experiencing at that moment that could be important for you to know. This is your chance to gain some insight into what they are experiencing so far and for you to gauge the <span class="emphasis"><em>initial</em></span> impressions. During this time, it is likely that your potential users will make the decision to either keep using your game or uninstall it. So, if some playtesters are leaning more towards the latter, find out why.</p></div></div>
