For example, one tester may like the Leaderboards because it gave them a sense of achievement, and the other may like them because they enjoyed being better than everyone else. These two varying opinions are useful; if your intention was to encourage competition, then at least you know that to some extent, it's working.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec97"></a>Asking them to explain the game to you</h3></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>

</span></td></tr></table></div><p>The same can be said about your game. If players can't describe what your game is about, or what it is supposed to achieve in its simplest form, then it's not clear enough. This could be because the rules are ill-defined or that the objectives are not clear enough. Perhaps your intention was to create a role-playing application to encourage students to submit their homework on time, but playtesters say that it's a <span class="emphasis"><em>time-management application</em></span>. While some of that might be true, it's not your intended idea. From here, you can begin to understand why.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec98"></a>Keeping it balanced with rules</h3></div></div></div><p>Another thing to consider is asking playtesters about the rules. Were the rules clear enough? Were they fair? Could they be improved? These types of question can also help to balance your game. If higher-level players have significant advantages over lower-level players, then it may be too difficult for them to engage with one another, whether it is to work together or against each other. Another important question to ask is weather any glitches occurred. While your rules may have been understandable, there may still be opportunities for players to gain an advantage. If so, it's better to fix it now than to find out after you have published it from some unhappy players.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec99"></a>Interacting and the interface</h3></div></div></div><p>So the game may be balanced, super fun to play, but the interface is ruining it for everyone. Perhaps you have a beautiful interface, but the gameplay just isn't fun. Well, find out why! Do players have difficulty with the controls of the application. For example, they swipe left and it goes right, or the button <span class="emphasis"><em>sometimes doesn't work</em></span>. Maybe that big red close button is just a little too big <span class="emphasis"><em>or red</em></span>. Things like this can really ruin an experience. For example, it can be extremely frustrating when you keep hitting <span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> to select something and nothing happens; and then all of sudden you're going at the speed of light through all the choices. If it happens once, some players can be forgiving, but if it is a constant issue, they will be heading for the uninstall option.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec100"></a>Post-mortem - evaluating the playtest</h3></div></div></div><p>So, what did everyone think? This is where you get some general feedback about what the playtesters experienced. After this point, you can begin to refine the discussion. They may all like the intro sequence, but why? Maybe one of them thought the music was great, and the others liked the visuals.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec101"></a>Reflecting at the end of it all</h3></div></div></div><p>By now, the playtesters have gone home. You're left with an empty testing space and a whole bunch of notes, ideas, and different thoughts that are going through your mind. Now is the time to get them down, on paper, in a Word document, wherever, but write them down! This is where you think about what is going right and wrong in your game, whether it was part of an intended feature or not. This is an important process because what happens here can greatly impact your game upon release.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note34"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to read more about playtesting, you should check out the following book: <span class="emphasis"><em>Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Tracy Fullerton</em></span>.</p></div></div></div>
