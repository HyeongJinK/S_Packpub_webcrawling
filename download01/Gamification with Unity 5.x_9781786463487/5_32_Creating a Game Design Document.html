<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec33"></a>Creating a Game Design Document</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>So now, you might have a vague idea about what kind of game you might want to design. If you don't, that is fine for now. This is where we will begin to craft what is known as the <span class="strong"><strong>Game Design Document</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GDD</strong></span>). The point of a GDD is to provide everyone within the game development team with a go-to guide for the game's overall design.</p><p>Things that you will want to include in your GDD are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game overview</strong></span>: What is your game about? Think of it like a more detailed elevator pitch. Someone reading this must be able to get a good understanding of what your game is about and what the player will do. Overall, this will be about 1-2 pages in length. In this section, you will want to also state your aim, objectives, and the outcomes of your gamified application.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Core game description</strong></span>: What is your game in more detail? You can take each point from the overview and elaborate on it in more detail. For instance, your aim is to rescue a princess from the Castle of Ra. This part explains how Ra is the long-lost friend of the princess's father, the king, who tried to kill Ra. You might also want to describe the type of genre that your game will be.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Demographics/Audience</strong></span>: Who are you intending this game for? Where are they from, and are certain ages not allowed to play it (for example, is it for 18+)? This is where you define your demographics and ultimately the target audience for your game. You can also refer to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Who or What Am I? Understanding the </em></span>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Player</em></span>, if you want to know more specific considerations about your users.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Art/Design</strong></span>: If you're creating a wonderful mood board depicting the aesthetics for various aspects of your game, this is the place to put it in. Also, with a brief description that somehow explains the intention. For example, you might have a bunch of images from an abandoned warehouse that is the inspiration for the UI and not the actual level itself. Explanations are everything! Ideally, you want to have more refined art that you have created in this section that helps to describe the aesthetic vision and direction of your game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Story</strong></span>: The overarching narrative drives your gameplay. It can be something as simple as you are the master of some magical deck of cards from various faraway lands or something more intricate, such as our story about Ra and the king. This is where more complex details are revealed to provide substance and explanation for the overall game and gameplay.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span>: Who the player is and who they will meet along the way are important, especially if they are important parts of the story. Even if there is only one character and that is the player, who they assume the role of and how this is explained in the game is clarified here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span>: Is the environment based on reality, augmented reality, or is it purely fictional? The environment is explained in more detail and which parts of it that the player can and cannot go. In this section, it could also be useful to develop a rough map of the environment. The last thing that you could also consider is that the environment doesn't necessarily mean majestic landscapes, or city skylines; the environment is where the user will spend most of their time interacting. Therefore, if you have a 2D gamified application that targets fitness, your environment could be the real world, or the application itself.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Features/gameplay</strong></span>: What kind of cool things can the player do, and how can they do it? This section covers all the different kinds of interaction that the player can perform during gameplay. You can refer to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Anatomy of Games</em></span> for more details about game elements and mechanics.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Audio (music, specially effects)</strong></span>: Audio can really make an experience something memorable. This doesn't necessarily imply something positive either. If you have a really beautifully designed application and every time the player interacts with a certain part of it, some horrendous sound plays, they will want to turn it off, and let's hope that if it is that bad, there is an option to mute it! The same goes for background music. That is where the types of audio that will feature in the game are described and accompanied with examples.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span>: The UI is extremely important, especially how it delivers information to a player at all moments of gameplay. How it looks, how the player interacts with it, and how it responds to interaction (for example, if it takes the player to another part of the game) can be explained here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Time Line</strong></span>: Ideally, the project needs an end date. That way, milestones can be set and work can be completed by certain dates. Otherwise, the project could go on and on and on.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, this is just a suggested structure. If you are also going to be developing something to pitch commercially say to a publisher, then it will need to include things such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Market analysis</strong></span>: Market analysis examines what is out there, competition, comparisons with other similar games, and so on. For example, if you're creating a game similar to Candy Crush, you might look at games such as Bejeweled and see how they are performing, what kind of features they have or haven't got, and how successful one is compared to the other, and much more.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Technical analysis</strong></span>: Here, we look at the technical details in more detail, such as the technology used, the types of technical risks that need to be taken (if any), the types of resources that are needed, alternatives, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Legal analysis</strong></span>: Legal issues can include anything from copyrighted material, licensing of certain software, fees, and also if any types of contract, non-disclosure agreements, and so on need to be implemented as part of the project's development, especially for outsourced work.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cost and revenue projections</strong></span>: The cost that your game is estimated to be and how much it will make are important to anyone you are trying to have invest in your idea. This can include anything from resources to employment costs, marketing, hardware, and software. The big issue here is to ensure that any numbers that are provided (such as cost, resources, and employee estimates) are supported by some sort of reference. For example, saying that the game will cost $100,000 to develop and two-thirds of that is dedicated to marketing might raise some red flags. This is unless you explain that it is because you're hiring some famous actress to do a 10-second advertisement for your game. Transparency is key.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now, so far we have just scratched the surface of what <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be in a GDD. Feel free to use, discard, or even add your own sections. There is no right or wrong way to create a GDD, but they all have the same main purpose. This is to explain to anyone, whether your team or someone from the public, what your game is about. The GDD is a constantly changing document; it will get updated, revised, and will change as your game progresses. Therefore, at each stage of the design process, even after meetings where aspects of the game are changed, it is important to make sure that the GDD reflects these changes accordingly. Now with that all sorted, creating a GDD begins with something to create it in. There are many ways to do this, and we will look at three. A great article that is worth checking out about GDDs can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3384/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3384/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php</a>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec50"></a>Google Drive</h3></div></div></div><p>Google Drive (with Google Docs) is probably the easiest way to go about creating a GDD, especially if you have a number of people within your group. The benefit of using Drive is that you can keep everything in one place (even with an offline backup if you install the application). It's free and simple to set up: all you need is a Google account. One of the benefits with Drive is that you can not only share the files and/or folders, but you can control who accesses it and what kind of access that they have (for example, edit, read, download, and so on), as well as see changes that are made. The great part of this is that users have the ability to revert to previous versions of the document, in the event something happens. Lastly, a range of different applications are available that we can see in the following screenshot, such as presentation and spreadsheet software:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec51"></a>Word (and Microsoft Office)</h3></div></div></div><p>Using Word (especially) with Dropbox is another good choice. It already has a bunch of preloaded paragraph styles so that managing sections is a bit easier. It is also less complicated than Google Drive when it comes to working without an Internet connection. Unlike Google Drive, it isn't free, so you will have to purchase a license to use it, if it didn't already come pre-installed with your device. There are also a number of ways that you can have access to Word through either purchasing the product or buying a subscription.</p><p>An example of Word can be seen in the following screenshot with its paragraph styles set up (on the right):</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec52"></a>InDesign</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, for those who are extremely into design and have the patience to set up paragraph styles, among <span class="emphasis"><em>other things</em></span>, then InDesign is a great design tool. Despite this, it makes setting up the aesthetics of your document a dream, especially if you want to then show your GDD around or even make it available to the end user as part of the <span class="emphasis"><em>development process</em></span>. InDesign offers many features, a lot more than Word or Google Docs, but requires a bit of knowledge of document processing applications, and terminology.</p><p>The only downside to using InDesign is that it doesn't have a sharing capability, so it is best used with some sort of version control program if you are planning on sharing the document on something such as Dropbox. We can see an example of the InDesign interface in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_05_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Each of these three programs is fantastic to use. Ultimately, it depends on what you want to achieve in the end. If you want something that keeps everyone on the same page, that is quick, simple, and something that everyone has access to, then Google Drive would be the suggested way to go. If just one or two people are managing the document, then Word is a good option. If you want to publish the GDD at a later date, whether online, printed, or even as something to show prospective publishers, then InDesign is a nice way to go.</p></div></div>
