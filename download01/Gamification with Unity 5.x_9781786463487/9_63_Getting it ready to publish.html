<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch09lvl1sec60"></a>Getting it ready to publish</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>So, you have finally finished making your game, and it is now time to hit the <span class="emphasis"><em>publish</em></span> button...but wait! There are a number of things that you need have done before publishing, despite how tempting it is to unleash your game out there in the wilderness.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec112"></a>Don't be modest, promote your game!</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't wait until you have published your game before you start telling people about it. Think about a marketing plan early on and get the ball rolling and the conversation started. Social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and even blogs if you don't have a website, are useful platforms to utilize.</p><p>While there is still time before you publish your game, starting early will make the most impact. This section will briefly explain a range of different social networking services and ways to utilize their features as part of your marketing strategies.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Get popular</strong></span>: Remember in school there were those <span class="emphasis"><em>popular</em></span> kids who knew everyone and everything? Well, the same thing exists in social networks, and especially in games. Take a moment to get to know who's who. Know who the influences are within your specific area, and try to reach out. Reaching out does not mean spamming them, but genuinely and honestly ask them for their help. This can be something as simple as a tweet or as detailed as an e-mail. To keep track of your <span class="emphasis"><em>social score</em></span>, you can use Klout (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.klout.com" target="_blank">www.klout.com</a>), which provides you with a score, or rather <span class="emphasis"><em>rating</em></span>, between 1 and 100 based on social media analytics.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Becoming official</strong></span>: If you already have a solid build for your game, try pitching it to popular blogs and websites. Perhaps your game helps individuals manage their diabetes in a new and innovative way. The idea is to get it featured on their website to gain a bit of traction and stir up some interest.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec113"></a>Sharing is caring</h3></div></div></div><p>The way you sell your game can be important to its success. Of course, a large part of it all has to do with the game actually being good, but it doesn't hurt to <span class="emphasis"><em>sell it</em></span>. Here are some ideas to use with social networking services as part of your marketing plan to get your game out there and build a bit of momentum before you publish. The great part of all of this is it can literally cost you nothing (except time, of course) to promote your game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec56"></a>Facebook</h4></div></div></div><p>Facebook offers a range of different features for advertisements and opportunities to connect with your audience:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pages</strong></span>: Create a page and populate it a bit before making it public. People don't want to come to an empty page, so give them a reason to stay. There are different ways to get visitors engaged, from an interesting read to an eye-catching photo. Which one is more beneficial will depend on what you want to achieve.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Posts</strong></span>: Posts can be utilized in many ways. Given that Facebook offers four different ways to interact with a post, like, comment, tag, or share, each can be used in ways outside these explicit functions. For example, if you're asking about a particular component for the game, such as a color scheme, you could ask them to <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> for option one, <span class="emphasis"><em>comment</em></span> for option two, and <span class="emphasis"><em>share</em></span> for option three. For option two, you can encourage them to <span class="emphasis"><em>tag</em></span> their friends as part of the process. This all works twofold: while you get them interacting with your posts, you're also getting a small portion of publicity from it all. For example, each time a user <span class="emphasis"><em>shares</em></span> the post, it's being displayed within the <span class="emphasis"><em>sharer's</em></span> network, and thus reaching more potential users.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Polls</strong></span>: Polls can be used as a way to quickly gauge users' opinions. This is a bit more direct than the methods explained previously. Of course, you can use polls to encourage competitive behavior such as <span class="emphasis"><em>the winning choice will be implemented in our next game</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Live</strong></span>: Facebook's <span class="emphasis"><em>live</em></span> feature allows you to stream an event in real time, so why not take advantage of it and demo some <span class="emphasis"><em>live game development</em></span> or a <span class="emphasis"><em>Q&amp;A</em></span>? This kind of setting allows your audience to connect with you and your team.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec57"></a>Twitter</h4></div></div></div><p>Keeping it short, sharp, and to the point is what Twitter is all about. Twitter is a lively fast-paced environment that allows news to be featured as it happens, or in short updates:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tweeting</strong></span>: There are a number of things to keep in mind when you are tweeting updates about your application, some of which, such as the time zone, we will cover later. However, Twitter uses a few key methods of interaction: reply, retweet, quote, favorite, and hashtags. Now, reply, as the name suggests, allows users to reply to what you have posted. This allows you to keep in touch with those who are interested. Retweeting is Twitter's version of <span class="emphasis"><em>sharing</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>favorites</em></span> is similar to <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span>. Therefore, as mentioned before, you can use these in the same way to interact with your audience and to expand your content across different users. Hashtags, on the other hand, are probably one of the most fundamental things to keep in mind when sharing content. Using unique hashtags helps you to not only keep track of content distribution that is related to your game, but it also makes it easier to be heard and not lost among other <span class="emphasis"><em>tweets</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip41"></a>Tip</h3><p>A great way to ensure that your hashtag is unique is to search it before using it.</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Periscope</strong></span>: Similar to Facebook Live, periscope allows Twitter users to Tweet live. Perhaps your audience is curious to see how you create the music for your game? Periscope it! Give them a teaser, and get them to come back for more!</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec58"></a>LinkedIn</h4></div></div></div><p>To target a more professional market, LinkedIn allows you to interact directly with your professional network. This can be particularly useful if you're part of groups or connected with people who are within the area that you are intending to target.</p><p>Some groups to get you started are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Gamification (open group) <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/4593540" target="_blank">www.linkedin.com/groups/4593540</a>

</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec59"></a>Instagram</h4></div></div></div><p>Instagram can be a great platform to post images, as seen in the following screenshot, to keep users engaged with all the image aspects of your project:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec60"></a>Snapchat and Vine</h4></div></div></div><p>They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so a short movie must tell volumes. Snapchat keeps things interesting with videos that are only available for a limited time, whereas Vine plays videos within a loop. Both are useful platforms to utilize and don't require a lot of time commitment.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec61"></a>YouTube</h4></div></div></div><p>Video is a great way to explain to your audience about changes or updates to your game either post-publication or pre-publication. One of the great things about video is that it can be a bit more personal in terms of how you are able to present yourself. Text, audio, and images can convey a range of different opinions, and express many emotions, but nothing sums it all up like a nicely done video.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec62"></a>Blogs and websites</h4></div></div></div><p>Blogs such as Tumblr and Blogger, among others, are great platforms to write longer posts about what is happening during the development process. See the following image of an example of Tumblr. These blogs are pretty simple to get started with and they can connect to a wide audience:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec63"></a>Documenting the process</h4></div></div></div><p>During development, many designers keep a development diary (also known as a dev diary). Just like one would keep a journal, full of thoughts, drawings, ideas, and so on, a dev diary works in the same way. As you develop your application, write a post, write something about a new feature, or a new aspect of your application. Perhaps introduce your team along the way so that people can have an idea about the people who are part of the game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl4sec9"></a>Describing updates</h5></div></div></div><p>While all of the social networking platforms tend to cycle through new information at a faster rate than blogs, blogs allow you to explain things in more detail. This is where the juice is and where you can really reach out to your audience. Describe a new update in detail, how you came up with it, when, where, and how you're going to implement it. When I say detail, you don't have to go into granular aspects.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl4sec10"></a>MailChimp</h5></div></div></div><p>If you don't have the time or resources to be constantly updating, then newsletters (and in turn, mailing lists) are a great way to let those who are interested know when cool things happen. Newsletters can be about different things, and feature different aspects of the project. They can contain news about different members such as <span class="emphasis"><em>meet the programmer</em></span> to keep readers involved and feel like part of the team.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec64"></a>Paying attention to statistics</h4></div></div></div><p>Many social networking platforms provide a section with statistics relating to various parts of the network, such as in the following screenshot (Twitter's analytic page). For example, every time you post something, you can find out how many people it reached, how many times it got shared and when, and then compare it to other statistics:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec65"></a>Engaging with your audience</h4></div></div></div><p>If you're documenting the process, ask those who are engaging with your content for their opinions. Create polls, post questions, and ask for their responses.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl4sec11"></a>Rewarding engagement</h5></div></div></div><p>Sites such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and so on all provide rewards for certain levels of commitment from their project backers. You can adopt similar approaches to the development and eventual release of your game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Competitions</strong></span>: Running competitions is a great way to get people involved. If you don't have the funds to create products, offer full versions of your game. Another option is to create some exclusive artwork/wallpapers and, if possible, get them printed.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Network distribution</strong></span>: During competitions, instead of asking people to just<span class="emphasis"><em> write a comment</em></span> in response to your question, get them to <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>share</em></span>, and even <span class="emphasis"><em>tag</em></span> friends as part of the process or as a condition for entering the competition. It's a win-win situation: they have the potential to gain something for free, you have publicized your game across many potential networks outside those that you are targeting on your own.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Feedback</strong></span>: Feedback is gold when it comes to making sure your game is as good as it can be. When people give you detailed feedback, they take time out of their days and commit it to helping you. In most cases, even negative feedback when it's constructively critical is important to consider and even implement during the iterative stages. Therefore, while feedback tends to be altruistic, reward those who make an effort.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec66"></a>It's a hoot! Managing social networks</h4></div></div></div><p>Managing one time zone is hard; managing multiple time zones can be a real challenge if you're not organized, especially if you are using many different social networks. The sections here describe different approaches to handling it all. These programs also allow you to schedule posts in the future.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip42"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you're planning on having many social networking platforms, then it is worthwhile taking the time to find a good social networking manager. Here are some suggestions:</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Hootsuite <a class="ulink" href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">https://hootsuite.com/</a>

</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl4sec12"></a>Remembering time zones</h5></div></div></div><p>Your audience is not going to be located in any one place, unless you're targeting a very specific audience. Therefore, you need to remember that there are 24 time zones and you need to reach them all somehow. A good way to ensure that you cover all the continents is to tweet the same info at least four times a day. But to avoid repetition, try to mix it up a bit, either by changing the post slightly or by posting other things in between. For example, if you're posting about a new dev diary post, follow it up with a post (or repost) from Instagram, or a link to your Facebook page. The last most important thing to keep in mind is, if you run competitions or anything that is time-sensitive, always put in the time zone, for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Check back here at 10:30am (GMT +2) for our live interview. Don't miss it!</em></span> A great online tool to quickly manage this is World Time Buddy, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com" target="_blank">http://www.worldtimebuddy.com</a>. An example of it is shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip43"></a>Tip</h3><p>There are many great applications that manage time zones around the world, so be sure to have one. Ideally, you want to post to each continent at an ideal time. For example, commute times and lunch are perfect times to schedule posts. Chances are, for the most part, they won't be looking at their feeds while working.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl4sec13"></a>Tag! You're it</h5></div></div></div><p>With so many social networks, it can be hard to be heard amongst the noise of every other game developer. Therefore, we are lucky that tags, better known as hashtags, exist. While posting on social networking services helps us be heard, using hashtags helps us to be heard by those that we need to listen. It is the difference between going to a supermarket and asking for bread or going to a bakery. They both have audiences, but one is more specific than the other. It is worthwhile taking the time to see how other developers and publishers that produce games that are similar to yours tag their posts.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec114"></a>Getting commercial</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're planning on uploading your application on either Android (Google Play Store) or iOS (Apple App Store), it is important that you review their policies and that your game respects those. In many cases, games get rejected for failing to meet some fundamental criteria. As a result, it delays the entire process. Besides the delay that this can cause, it can result in a loss of revenue, such as additional costs for fixing the issue if you need to hire programmers, designers, and so on.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec67"></a>Terms, conditions, policies, and agreements</h4></div></div></div><p>Make sure you know not only the requirements that you need to meet in order to upload your game, but also that your game adheres to them.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec115"></a>The publishing checklist</h3></div></div></div><p>Here is a simple checklist to ensure that you have the basics sorted when it comes to publishing your game on their relevant app stores:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Check the size of the application.</p></li><li><p>Check to see if your game adheres to the terms and conditions, and/or policies for the store.</p></li><li><p>Test on a range of difference devices.</p></li><li><p>Verify that images/assets have been optimized.</p></li><li><p>Verify that it works.

It can be done by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings...</strong></span>. The following screen appears:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_09_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Before we build, we need to add a scene. In the project we developed during this book, we only have one scene, so we can add it by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span>. Then, we need to specify a platform; in our case, we can pick Android. If you want to really go deeper into the settings, you can press the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings...</strong></span> button, and you will see this screen in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><p>

</p><p>Here, you can granularly set how your game will be exported. In our case, for Android, it's really important to set an identifier, otherwise Unity won't allow us to export the game. To do this, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Other Settings</strong></span> tab, if it's not already opened, and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Identification</strong></span> section.
