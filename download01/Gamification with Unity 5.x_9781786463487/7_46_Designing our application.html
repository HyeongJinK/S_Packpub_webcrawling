This section will give you an overview of what we are going to implement in this chapter.</p><p>First of all, we want the user to use a lateral menu to navigate through different parts of the application, as in the following diagram:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_07_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Then, we want to show the tasks to the player, like in the following diagram:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_07_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Do you notice the two buttons at the bottom that <span class="emphasis"><em>create a new task</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>delete completed</em></span> ones? We will add this later, but it presents us with some additional functionality to add to the application by creating a new task screen. Of course, we have the profile page, which we created in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Who or What Am I? Understanding the Player</em></span>; following screenshot shows this, just to refresh your memory:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463487/graphics/image_07_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we also have a home page, where for the moment we can just show the profile picture of the user or the logo of the app. Now, with this said, we can start working.</p></div>
