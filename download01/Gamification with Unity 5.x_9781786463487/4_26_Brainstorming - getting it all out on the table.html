Here are some examples of things to consider:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game concepts</strong></span> are based on the kind of game that you want to create. What are the types of theme that your game will be influenced by? Do you want to create something like Zombies! Run (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zombiesrungame.com" target="_blank">www.zombiesrungame.com</a>) that focuses on a player getting fit by having to run away from hordes of zombies?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game-play experience</strong></span> is what the overall experience will be like that you want your player to engage in. Do you want a fast-paced kind of experience or something that progressively builds up challenges? Take a moment to think about this; even if you have a basic idea, it can help to guide you during the brainstorming process.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game elements and mechanics</strong></span> as we discussed in <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a></em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Anatomy of Games</em></span>, is how the game interacts with the player and vice versa. Each time a player achieves an objective, what happens and <span class="emphasis"><em>how </em></span>does a player achieve an objective in the first place? Again, a basic idea at this stage is all that you need. Ideally, you want to have a feel for what you want to achieve, so that the brainstorming process becomes more focused.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game features</strong></span> (such as units, weapons, power-ups, and so on) help your game feature a range of different objects that the player needs to collect or use at certain points during gameplay. How can a player get them, how many do they need? The list of questions can go on and on depending on how granular you want to be, but these are important, especially considering that if you cannot answer them, it is probably time to question their relevance in the game.</p></li></ul></div></div>
