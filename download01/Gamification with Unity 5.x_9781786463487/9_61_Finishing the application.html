But before we do just that, there are some things that we need to consider. Some of the main issues that we will cover later in this chapter includes a <span class="emphasis"><em>lack of optimization</em></span> (graphics, assets, code), <span class="emphasis"><em>failing to test the application enough</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>diversely</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>not having enough time to market it properly</em></span>. The biggest issue is that a game designer discovers this all too late in the process and, as a result, delays occur, and resources, time, money, and energy are wasted. Here are some things to consider when getting your project ready for publishing. Of course, these can be applied to all levels of the development process.</p></div>
