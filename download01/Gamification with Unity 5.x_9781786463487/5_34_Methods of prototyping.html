The two main methods of prototyping are paper and rapid. Each can use a range of different materials, just like in the image below, or you can create it digitally.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec62"></a>Paper prototyping</h3></div></div></div><p>To put simply, it involves no use of technology and only physical materials. This is what caveman game developers would have used before creating their final games. Paper prototyping includes using primitive resources such as pens, paper, scissors, glue, post-it notes, stickers, and so forth. The idea is to get your basic ideas out and get a more physical visualization, for example, if you're creating a game to encourage workplace productivity. You might reconstruct a portion of your workspace environment and then add various elements such as obstacles (which can be plastic counters) that the player has to overcome during their hourly commute to get coffee. It's also a good way to quickly generate many versions and to make observations about how gameplay is affected if something is added, removed, or changed. The best part is that it involves no code, so before you start pulling your hair out because of bugs or features that didn't quite work the way you thought they did after spending weeks implementing them, you get to rough it out old-school! The following is a list of common items that you can use around your house or find at your local dollar shops for use during paper prototyping sessions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pens, pencils, highlighters</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Erasers (also make great counters)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Toy money</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dice</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Bottle caps</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Clothes pegs/pins</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Stones</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Index cards</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Post-it notes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Colored paper (varying shapes and sizes)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Glass pebbles</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip21"></a>Tip</h3><p>A fun activity to get you used to the paper-prototyping process is to <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse engineer</em></span> popular games such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, or even Donkey Kong. Use a large piece of paper for the ground and draw or print out the characters and even some of your own and see how you can modify or <span class="emphasis"><em>mod</em></span> the games into something different.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec63"></a>Rapid prototyping</h3></div></div></div><p>Just as the name suggests, this encourages a quick turnaround of the prototype from an idea to something a bit more tangible. It draws upon the same principles as discussed in <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a prototype - what you'll need</em></span>, just within smaller time constraints. The key thing to keep in mind here is that you have to be decisive with your ideas and remain efficient. You will throw away ideas and spend time on things that can be discarded later in the game. The main thing is to identify when to keep going with an idea and when to let go. The easiest way to determine if an idea is worth keeping and working on is to look at it through the perspective of the goals and questions that you set out to achieve with the prototype. If the current part is drifting away from this, then either put it aside until later or discard it completely. Avoid ideas becoming complex and technical, and focus on their functionality and creativity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>Some great books to check out about the game design and prototyping process are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
