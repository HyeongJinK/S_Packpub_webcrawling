It is likely that you have a nice memory of a time when you were playing a game and felt completely immersed and enjoyed the experience; it is also equally likely that you recall when this was not the case. Ideally, as designers, we want anyone that plays our games or uses our gamified applications to have pleasant memories and experiences, and even better to bring others into our worlds of fantasy and enjoyment. Therefore, in this chapter, we will look at the following topics so that we can create an enjoyable experience for your users:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To begin, <span class="emphasis"><em>Keeping 'em engaged</em></span> will look at ways to provide feedback, reinforcement, as well as track the progress of the player during their engagement with the application. In addition, it will describe ways to engage players throughout the experience.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>How am I doing?</em></span> discusses how gaming experiences report feedback. Whether you provide a player with a brightly colored pop-up saying <span class="emphasis"><em>FANTASTIC</em></span> or have an audio file playing that gives them a verbal pat on the back, we will look at different types of feedback and how to implement them in Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As we dive further into this chapter, <span class="emphasis"><em>You've come this far, keep going</em></span> looks at the importance of progress for players who want to see how far they have come since they began and reflect on their progress, followed by <span class="emphasis"><em>Showing off how awesome you are</em></span>, which will acknowledge your progress.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Finally, we finish this chapter with <span class="emphasis"><em>Taking in the view with Dashboards</em></span>. This section shows the player everything at a glance. It looks at the different types of layout that are available and how they display the player's information
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To help improve the design process, <span class="emphasis"><em>There is no I in Team</em></span> talks about agile gamification attempts to change the way that we work not just by ourselves, but also in teams. Therefore, we will look at understanding the different dynamics that this involves when it comes to gamification.</p></li></ul></div></div>
