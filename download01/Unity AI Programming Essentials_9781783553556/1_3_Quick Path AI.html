Although the <a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a>next two AIs have more features, this AI is added because of its blocky nature. This block approach creates a grid-based path and is used with many types of games, but this AI works especially well with the excitement in the voxel game genre; it is suited for cubed topography.</p><p>To start with, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new 3D scene and import the Quick Path AI from the Asset Store.</p></li><li><p>Next, set up some cubes, planes, or other objects as your terrain, and then place all of these game objects into an empty game object. Name this game object <code class="literal">Terrain</code>.</p></li><li><p>Next, on the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, add a component, <span class="strong"><strong>QuickPath</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Grid</strong></span>. Immediately, you should see a series of blue lines that show up on the cubes. These indicate all the points where a character can move in the AI.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_01_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, we need a character to move around the scene. Create a sphere, or any object, and name it <code class="literal">NPC</code>.</p></li><li><p>Then, we'll add a Component, <span class="strong"><strong>QuickPath</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Follow Mouse Object</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, when you run the scene, assuming it is lit up and has the camera pointing where you want it to, you'll see <code class="literal">NPC</code> on <code class="literal">Terrain</code>.</p></li><li><p>Click<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> somewhere on the <code class="literal">Terrain</code> object, and watch the <code class="literal">NPC</code> object move to that point.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_01_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Although we might say that the pathfinding in this is clearly working, we should also add an obstacle to the scene: something that shouldn't be stepped on. To do this, add another cube somewhere. Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel for the obstacle and tag it with <span class="strong"><strong>Obstacle</strong></span> by selecting that tag from the drop-down, or if it is not an option select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tag...</strong></span> and add <code class="literal">Obstacle</code> to the tag list.</p></li><li><p>Next, in the <code class="literal">Terrain</code> game object, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Grid</strong></span> component, expand <span class="strong"><strong>Disallowed Tags</strong></span>, increase the size to 1 and enter <span class="strong"><strong>Obstacle</strong></span> for the new element.</p></li><li><p>Next, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> button at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Grid</strong></span> component. Now you will see that the grid markers skipped the cube as an option. If you want to test more, click somewhere else on the <code class="literal">Terrain</code> object and watch the <code class="literal">NPC</code> object move to the clicked point avoiding the obstacle.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_01_03.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, we've <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>seen how to set up pathfinding with Quick Path, so let's look at another way to set up pathfinding with React AI.</p></div>
