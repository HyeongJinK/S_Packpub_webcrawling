In this chapter, we looked at the different parameters to customize navigation meshes. We looked at things such as setting the character size and walkable slopes and discussed the importance of the cell size parameter. We then saw how to customize our mesh by tagging different areas as not walkable and how to set up multiple navigation meshes for different characters.</p><p>We now have all the essential skills we need to create AI in Unity. We've seen how to have a character move, navigate, and sense other characters in our game scenes as well as how to set up behavior trees to make decisions and integrate animation. We also looked at different AI use cases, such as crowds, driving, and had our characters attack and change behavior based on game events. This covers a lot about AI, but game AI is a huge and much studied topic and there is much more to learn. By doing some searching, you'll find that there are many online articles, textbooks, and conference talks that you can study to make even more advanced AI.</p></div>
