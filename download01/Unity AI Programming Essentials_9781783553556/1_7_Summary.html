We tried three different ones: Quick Path, React, and RAIN. But our characters need to be able to do more than just walk from one point to a second one in our levels. In the next chapter, we will extend what we have learned about pathfinding here by seeing how to set up patrolling behaviors for our characters. This will be the start for having characters walk around a level in a realistic way.</p></div>
