We also saw how to tag objects with aspects so that they are visible to our AI. We also saw how to change a character's activities based on sensing, and we discussed different settings for sensors and how to tweak them. Sensors and aspects can make your game's AI more realistic, but they need to be carefully adjusted to give good results.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at taking our work with navigation and mind development to make our characters react more to their environments. Specifically, we will see how all of the AI we have used so far can make our AI characters adapt to different game events and create more complex AI.</p></div>
