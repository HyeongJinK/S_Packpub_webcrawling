These are basic attack behaviors and can be extended to more complex and game-specific behaviors, and we discussed how to do this when creating groups of enemies.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at another special AI case, which is driving and cars. However, instead of using a general-purpose AI system such as RAIN or React AI, we will use an AI plugin specifically designed for cars that takes into account physics to create realistic driving.</p></div>
