Where the previous chapter focused on defining crowds by defining wander behaviors for different characters individually, in this chapter we focused on defining groups as a whole. We discussed steering-based group design and looked at the Fame Crowd Simulation API that you can use to set up crowds easily, give them direction, and have them adjust steering based on other factors in the environment, obstacles, and vector fields. We then discussed defining your own crowd AI for more unique systems and looked at ANT-Op as an example of this. This should give you all the info you need to create all kinds of crowds for your games.</p><p>In the next few chapters, we will turn the focus to having AI characters interact with their environment. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Sensors and Activities</em></span>, we will look at having our characters sense things in the environment and react to them.</p></div>
