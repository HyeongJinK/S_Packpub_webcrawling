We can add brake and drift zones to help configure<a id="id272" class="indexterm"></a> the general behavior of the car as it drives around the scene, and we can integrate Smart Car with other AI systems such as RAIN.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec28"></a>Adding brake zones and drift zones</h3></div></div></div><p>Another <a id="id273" class="indexterm"></a>interesting thing you can do <a id="id274" class="indexterm"></a>with Smart Car is define <a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a>zones in the level to either cause the car to brake and slow down<a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a> or adjust the friction of the car to make it drift. These are similar to the vector fields we saw in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Crowd Control</em></span>, where we place them in the level to affect the AI, and they aren't visible to the player but are good to use for scripting level experiences. To create a brake or drift zone in your game, add a cube to the game (go to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>) and scale and translate the area you want to tag in the level. In the Inspector window for the cube, set its tag to <span class="strong"><strong>BrakeZone</strong></span> and for a drift zone set the tag to <span class="strong"><strong>DriftZone</strong></span>. Next, in <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> for the cube, check <span class="strong"><strong>Is Trigger</strong></span> to true, so the car will get a message of intersecting with a cube but won't stop and collide with it. Lastly, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> so that the cube is invisible in the game. Now when you run the demo, if the car's speed is <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span> or over when it enters the brake zone, you will see it slow down, and if its speed is <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span> or over, you will see it drift in the drift zone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec29"></a>Integrating with other AI systems</h3></div></div></div><p>In this <a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a>demo, we've seen<a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a> that setting up an AI car that drives around is easy to do with Smart Car. However, what if your game isn't just a driving game but has car driving as one part of the game? If that's the case, you can mix Smart Car with another AI system easily. For RAIN integration, import the RAIN package into your scene. Then, go to <span class="strong"><strong>RAIN</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Entity</strong></span> and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Aspect: Visual Aspects</strong></span>. This creates an entity with an aspect that can be sensed by additional RAIN AI entities you can create in the scene, making the car just one part of a larger AI system.</p></div></div>
