<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch11lvl1sec53"></a>Culling areas</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Being <a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a>able to set up areas as walkable or not is an important part of creating a level. To demo this, let's divide the level into two parts and create a bridge between the two. Take our demo and duplicate the floor and pull it down. Then transform one of the walls to a bridge. Then, add two other pieces of geometry to mark areas that are dangerous to walk on, like lava.</p><p>Here is an example setup:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_11_08.jpg" /></div><p>This is<a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a> a basic scene with a bridge to cross.</p><p>If you recreate the navigation mesh now, all the geometry will be covered and the bridge won't be recognized. To fix this, you can create a new tag called <code class="literal">Lava</code> and tag the geometry under the bridge with it. Then, in the navigation meshes' RAIN component, add <code class="literal">Lava</code> to the unwalkable tags. If you then regenerate the mesh, only the bridge is walkable. This is a screenshot of a navigation mesh with polygons that are under the bridge culled out:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_11_09.jpg" /></div><p>To see this in action, create a new ship and add a target to the scene on different sizes of the bridge. Set <a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a>the ship's behavior tree to have a <span class="strong"><strong>move</strong></span> node with the target, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_11_10.jpg" /></div><p>The preceding screenshot shows a basic <span class="strong"><strong>move</strong></span> node to a navigation point behavior tree.</p><p>If you run the demo now, you will see the ship cross the bridge:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553556/graphics/3556OT_11_11.jpg" /></div><p>The preceding screenshot shows the ship crossing the bridge to go to its navigation target. Using<a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a> layers and the walkable tag, you can customize navigation meshes.</p></div>
