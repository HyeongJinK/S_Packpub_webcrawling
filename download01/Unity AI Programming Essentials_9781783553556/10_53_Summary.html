We saw how to use RAIN's animate node to change the character animation from its behavior tree with both Unity's legacy animation system and Mecanim. In the next chapter, we will go back to discussing character movement across a scene. We will look at more advanced uses of navigation meshes and how to create them in more detail to give our characters better movement.</p></div>
