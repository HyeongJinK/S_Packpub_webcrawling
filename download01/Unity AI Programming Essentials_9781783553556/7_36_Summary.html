This was done using methods we learned in the previous chapters, and we also took a look at RAIN's motor system to allow our adaptions to be more customizable. Our demos in this chapter have been pretty straightforward, but there is no reason why this demo couldn't be extended to have more events to send and more reactions defined in the character behavior trees. However, our demos have been missing one important thing, which is yet to be discussed: the player. In the next chapter, we will discuss how AI characters attack by adding a player to our scene and having our characters react and attack. We will discuss how to create enemies for the player and have them attack the player.</p></div>
