Assuming that there are no obstacles, the object can just be moved in the direction of the target. But the AI part of it is all about navigating the obstacles.</p><p>A poor <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>AI might try walking a <span class="strong"><strong>Non-Player Character</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>) directly to the target. Then, if it is blocked, it randomly tries to go to the right or left to look for a space that might help. The character can get caught in different areas and become permanently stuck.</p><p>A better AI will walk an NPC in an intelligent way to a target, and will never get stuck in different areas. To compute a good path for the NPC to walk, the AI system will use a graph that represents the game level, and a graph search algorithm is used to find the path. The<a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a> industry-standard algorithm for pathfinding is <span class="strong"><strong>A*</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>A Star</strong></span>), a quick graph search algorithm that uses a cost function between nodes—in pathfinding usually the distance—and the algorithm tries to minimize the overall cost (distance) of the path. If you want to learn to code your own pathfinding AI, try A* because it is simple to implement and has a lot of simple improvements that you can apply for your game's needs.</p><p>The AIs <a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>we are about to discuss will take care of the pathfinding algorithms for you, and ultimately reduce the time it takes to breathe AI life into your game. Now let's look at Quick Path AI.</p></div>
