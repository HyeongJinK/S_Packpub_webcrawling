Each AI had its own approach.</p><p>For patrol as well as pathfinding, Quick Path had very few steps. If your need is mostly pathfinding, it does exactly what it claims to do easily. As for React, it does not have patrol out of the box, as we saw in the last chapter. However, it was not difficult to create a script that operates inside its behavior tree AI editor. This is a powerful system that you can use to allow designers to easily access and apply your awesome scripts, but you have to be comfortable programming to build the pieces for it. For RAIN, which made this about as easy as a big red button. With one setting changed, we changed the pathfinding AI into a patrolling AI. RAIN comes equipped with a huge variety of prebuilt character controlling; we looked at how to use a different waypoint system, a waypoint network, to give variety to our character when patrolling.</p><p>This concludes our chapters on setting up basic character pathfinding and movement. In later chapters, we will look in more detail at different aspects of this, such as animation and creating navigation meshes. In the next chapter, we will look at customizing our characters by investigating behavior trees in more detail. We will also learn to create more advanced setups using behavior trees.</p></div>
