We went through the process of defining behaviors, deciding the different actions the behaviors will perform and the transitions between the actions. Then, we set up a character and run the game. This is the process to create logic for your game characters, deciding what the behaviors are and the different conditions that can cause them to become active.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at how to use behavior trees more with character movement and see how to set up the wander behavior for crowd creation. We will explore AIs that will control a large collection of NPCs moving in distinctly separate low-repeating paths.</p></div>
