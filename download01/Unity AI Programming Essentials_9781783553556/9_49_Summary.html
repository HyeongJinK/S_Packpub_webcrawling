We discussed why automotive AI is different than most AIs because of the physics involved, and we also saw how to set up a car model, create a path for the car, and add obstacles. We also looked at using Unity's built-in navigation mesh system, instead of using third-party ones such as RAIN, and discussed additional features for car AI and how we can integrate it with another AI system such as RAIN.</p><p>In the next two chapters, we will look at how to combine character animations and AI to give them a realistic appearance and learn more about creating complex navigation meshes for different AIs.</p></div>
