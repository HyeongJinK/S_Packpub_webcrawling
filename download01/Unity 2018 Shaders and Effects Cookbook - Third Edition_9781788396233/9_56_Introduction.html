With these screen effects, we can create stunning real-time images with Bloom, Motion Blur, HDR effects, and so on. Most modern games on the market today make heavy use of these screen effects for their depth of field effects, Bloom effects, and even color correction effects.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Post Processing Stack</em></span>, we discussed how to use this with Unity's built-in Post Processing Stack, but in this chapter, you will learn how to build up the script system yourself. This system will give you the control to create many kinds of screen effects. We will cover <code class="literal">RenderTexture</code>, what the depth buffer is, and how to create effects that give you Photoshop-like control over the final rendered image of your game. By utilizing screen effects for your games, you not only round out your shader writing knowledge, but you will also have the power to create your own incredible real-time renders with Unity from scratch.</p></div>
