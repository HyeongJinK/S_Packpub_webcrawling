We won't be talking about any one platform specifically, but we are going to break down the elements of shaders we can adjust in order to make them more optimized for mobiles and efficient on any platform in general. These techniques range from understanding what Unity offers in terms of built-in variables that reduce the overhead of the shaders memory to learning about ways in which we can make our own shader code more efficient. This chapter will cover the following recipes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Techniques to make shaders more efficient</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Profiling your shaders</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Modifying our shaders for mobile</li></ul></div></div>
