Some take place in <span>fantasy</span><a id="id325209371" class="indexterm"></a> worlds or future sci-fi worlds, and some even take place in the Old West, where film cameras were just being developed and the movies that people watched were black and white or sometimes tinted with what is called a <span class="strong"><strong>sepia effect</strong></span>. The <span>look</span><a id="id325453785" class="indexterm"></a> is very distinct, and we are going to replicate this look using a screen effect in Unity.</p><p>There are a few steps to achieving this look; just to make the whole screen black and white or grayscale, we need to break down this effect into its component parts. If we analyze some reference footage of an old movie, we can begin to do this. Let's take a look at the following image and break down the elements that make up the old movie look:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788396233/graphics/7464f6dc-2977-4f06-844f-721082633332.png" /></div><p>We constructed this image using a few reference images found online. It is always a good idea to try and utilize Photoshop to construct images like this to aid you in creating a plan for your new screen effect. Performing this process not only tells us the elements we will have to code in, but it also gives us a quick way to see which <span>blending</span><a id="id325453804" class="indexterm"></a> modes work and how we will construct the layers of our screen effect. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec157"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we know what we have to make, let's take a look at how each of the layers is combined to create the final effect and gather some resources for our shader and screen effect script:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sepia tone</strong></span>: This is a relatively <span>simple</span><a id="id325453453" class="indexterm"></a> effect to achieve, as we just need to bring all the pixel colors of the original render texture to a single color range. This is easily achieved using the luminance of the original image and adding a constant color. Our first layer will look like the following screenshot:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788396233/graphics/184fc95e-cf71-4776-96a6-f2d1cf5c562c.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Vignette effect</strong></span>: We can always see <span>some</span><a id="id325453478" class="indexterm"></a> sort of soft border around old films when they are being projected using an old movie projector. This is caused because the bulb that is used for the movie projector has more brightness in the middle than it does at the edges of the film. This effect is generally called the vignette effect and is the second layer in our screen effect. We can achieve this with an overlaid texture over the whole screen. The following screenshot demonstrates what this layer looks like, isolated as a texture:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788396233/graphics/f62db259-b026-4c57-b82e-3ad42a54ffeb.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Dust and scratches</strong></span>: The third and <span>final</span><a id="id325453504" class="indexterm"></a> layer in our old movie screen effect is dust and scratches. This layer will utilize two different tiled textures, one for scratches and one for dust. The reason is that we will want to animate these two textures over time at different tiling rates. This will give the effect that the film is moving along and there are small scratches and dust on each frame of the old film. The following screenshot demonstrates this effect isolated to its own texture:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788396233/graphics/2a8b0dea-c8c3-459c-a6aa-30d146d16e61.png" /></div><p>Let's get our screen effect system ready with the preceding textures.

Keeping this concept in mind always helps when developing new screen effects.</p><p>Here, we have the first set of lines of code in our <code class="literal">frag()</code> function:</p><pre class="programlisting">fixed4 frag(v2f_img i) : COLOR 
{ 
    //Get the colors from the RenderTexture and the uv's 
    //from the v2f_img struct

    //Get the pixels from the Vignette Texture 
    fixed4 vignetteTex = tex2D(_VignetteTex, i.uv); </pre><p>The first line of code, just after the <code class="literal">frag()</code> function declaration, is the definition of how the UVs should work for our main render texture or the actual rendered frame of our game. As we are looking to fake the effect of an old film style, we want to adjust the UVs of our render texture in every frame, such that they flicker. This flickering simulates how the winding of the film's projector is just a bit off. This tells us that we need to animate the UVs and this is what this first line of code is doing.</p><p>We used the built-in <code class="literal">_SinTime</code> variable, which Unity provides, to get a value between <code class="literal">-1</code> and <code class="literal">1</code>. We then multiply this by a very small number, in this case, <code class="literal">0.005</code>, to reduce the intensity of the effect. The final value is then multiplied again by the <code class="literal">_RandomValue</code> variable, which we generated in the effect script. This value bounces back and forth between <code class="literal">-1</code> and <code class="literal">1</code> to basically flip the direction of the motion back and forth.</p><p>Once our UVs are built and stored in the <code class="literal">renderTexUV</code> variable, we can <span>sample</span><a id="id325454211" class="indexterm"></a> the render texture using a <code class="literal">tex2D()</code> function. This operation then gives us our final render texture, which we can use to process further in the rest of the shader.</p><p>Moving on to the last line in the previous image, we simply do a straight sample of the vignette texture using the <code class="literal">tex2D()</code> function. We don't need to use the animated UVs we already created, as the vignette texture will be tied to the motion of the camera itself and not to the flickering of the camera film.</p><p>The following code snippet illustrates the second set of lines of code in our <code class="literal">frag()</code> function:</p><pre class="programlisting">//Process the Scratches UV and pixels

        i.uv.y + (_RandomValue * (_SinTime.z * _dustYSpeed))); 
fixed4 dustTex = tex2D(_DustTex, dustUV); </pre><p>These lines of code are almost exactly like the previous lines of code, in which we need to generate unique animated UV values to modify the position of our screen effect layers. We simply use the built-in <code class="literal">_SinTime</code> value to get a value between <code class="literal">-1</code> and <code class="literal">1</code>, multiply it by our random value, and then by another multiplier to adjust the overall speed of the animation. Once these UV values are generated, we can then sample our dust and scratches texture using these new animated values.</p><p>Our next set of code handles the creation of the <span>colorizing</span><a id="id325454253" class="indexterm"></a> effect for our old film screen effect. The following code snippet demonstrates these lines:</p><pre class="programlisting">// get the luminosity values from the render texture using the YIQ values

fixed4 finalColor = lum + lerp(_SepiaColor, _SepiaColor +
     fixed4(0.1f,0.1f,0.1f,1.0f), _RandomValue);</pre><p>With this set of code, we are creating the actual color tinting of the entire render texture. To accomplish this, we first need to turn the render texture into the grayscale version of itself. To do this, we can use the luminosity values given to us by the <code class="literal"><span>YIQ</span></code> values. <code class="literal">YIQ</code> values are the color space used by the NTSC color TV system. Each letter in <code class="literal">YIQ</code> actually stores color constants that are used by TVs to adjust the color for readability.</p><p>While it is not necessary to actually know the reasons for this color scale, it should be known that the <code class="literal">Y</code> value in <code class="literal">YIQ</code> is the constant luminance value for any image. So, we can generate a grayscale image of our render texture by taking each pixel of the render texture and dotting it with our luminance values. This is what the first line in this set is doing.</p><p>Once we have the luminance values, we can simply add the color we want to tint the image with. This color is passed from our script to our shader, then to our <code class="literal">CGPROGRAM</code> block, where we can add it to our grayscale render to texture. Once completed, we will have a perfectly tinted image.</p><p>Finally, we create the blending between each of our layers in our screen effect. The following code snippet shows the set of code we are looking at:</p><pre class="programlisting">//Create a constant white color we can use to adjust opacity of effects

return finalColor </pre><p>Our last set of code is relatively <span>simple</span><a id="id325465228" class="indexterm"></a> and doesn't really need a ton of explanation. In short, it is simply multiplying all the layers together to reach our final result. Just like we multiplied our layers together in Photoshop, we multiply them together in our shader. Each layer is processed through a <code class="literal">lerp()</code> function so that we can adjust the opacity of each layer, which gives more artistic control over the final effect.
