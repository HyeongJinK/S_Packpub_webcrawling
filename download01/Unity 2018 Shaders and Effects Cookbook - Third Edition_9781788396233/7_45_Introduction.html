What they lack in expressivity, they compensate for with power: Vertex and Fragment Shaders are not limited by physical constraints and are perfect for non-photorealistic effects. This chapter will focus on a technique called the <span class="strong"><strong>grab pass</strong></span>, which <span>allows</span><a id="id325209389" class="indexterm"></a> these shaders to simulate deformations.</p></div>
