This will allow developers, including artists, to be able to create shaders in a similar manner to material editors in 3D modeling programs such as Autodesk Maya and Blender, or the material editor in the Unreal Engine. At the time of writing, Shader Graph is only supported for certain kinds of projects and doesn't allow the same flexibility as writing the shaders from scratch.</p></div>
