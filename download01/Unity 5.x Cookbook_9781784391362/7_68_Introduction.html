Mixamo is a complete solution for character production, rigging, and animation. In fact, the character in use was designed with Mixamo's character creation software called <span class="strong"><strong>Fuse</strong></span>, and rigged <a id="id693" class="indexterm"></a>with the Mixamo <span class="strong"><strong>Auto-rigger</strong></span>. You can find out more about Mixamo and their <a id="id694" class="indexterm"></a>products at Unity's Asset Store (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/publisher/150" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/publisher/150</a>) or their <a id="id695" class="indexterm"></a>website at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.mixamo.com/" target="_blank">https://www.mixamo.com/</a>.</p><p>Please note that although Mixamo offers Mecanim-ready characters and animation clips, we will use, for the recipes in this chapter, unprepared animation clips. The reason is to make you more confident when dealing with assets obtained by other methods and sources.</p></div></div>
