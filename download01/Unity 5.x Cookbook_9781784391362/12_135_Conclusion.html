This is achieved in the <code class="literal">OnInspectorGUI()</code> method by first calling the <code class="literal">serializedObject.Update()</code> method, and after all changes have been made in the Inspector, finally calling the <code class="literal">serializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties()</code> method.
