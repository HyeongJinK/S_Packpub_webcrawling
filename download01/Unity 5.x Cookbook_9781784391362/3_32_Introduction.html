In this chapter, we present a range of recipes to introduce the basics of 2D animation in Unity 5, and help you understand the relationships between the different animation elements.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec95"></a>The big picture</h3></div></div></div><p>In Unity 2D animations can be created in several different ways â€“ one way is to create many images, each <a id="id268" class="indexterm"></a>slightly different, which frame-by-frame give the appearance of movement. A second way to create animations is by defining keyframe positions for individual parts of an object (for example, the arms, legs, feet, head, eyes, and so on), and getting Unity to calculate all the in-between positions when the game in running.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784391362/graphics/1362OT_03_21.jpg" /></div><p>Both sources of animations become <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Clips</strong></span> in the Animation panel. Each <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Clip</strong></span> then <a id="id269" class="indexterm"></a>becomes a <span class="strong"><strong>State</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator Controller State Machine</strong></span>. We then define under what conditions a GameObject will <span class="strong"><strong>Transition</strong></span> from one animation state (clip) to another.</p></div></div>
