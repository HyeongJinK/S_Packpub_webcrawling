In fact, we can't stress enough how crucial it is to the player's immersion in a virtual environment. Just think of the engine running in your favorite racing game, the distant urban buzz in a simulator game, or the creeping noises in horror games. Think of how these sounds transport you <span class="emphasis"><em>into</em></span> the game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec254"></a>The big picture</h3></div></div></div><p>Before getting on with the recipes, let's step back and have a quick review on how sound works on <a id="id923" class="indexterm"></a>Unity 5.</p><p>Audio files can be embedded into GameObjects through the<a id="id924" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> component. Unity supports<a id="id925" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>3D sounds</strong></span>, which means that the location and distance between the audio sources and <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> matter in the way the <a id="id926" class="indexterm"></a>sound is perceived in terms of loudness and the left/right balance. This is unless the audio source is specified as <span class="strong"><strong>2D sound</strong></span> (which is usually the case for the background soundtrack music).</p><p>Although all sound is sent to the scene's <span class="strong"><strong>Audio </strong></span><a id="id927" class="indexterm"></a><span class="strong"><strong>Listener</strong></span> (a component that is usually attached to<a id="id928" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, and that shouldn't be attached simultaneously on more than one object), Unity 5 brings a new player to the audio scene: the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Mixer</strong></span>. The Audio mixer radically changes the way in which sound elements can be experienced and worked with. It allows developers to mix and arrange audio pretty much in the same way that musicians and producers<a id="id929" class="indexterm"></a> do in their <span class="strong"><strong>Digital Audio Workstations</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>D.A.W</strong></span>), such as <span class="strong"><strong>GarageBand</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>ProTools</strong></span>. It allows<a id="id930" class="indexterm"></a> you to route audio source clips into specific channels<a id="id931" class="indexterm"></a> that can have their volumes individually adjusted and processed by customized effects and filters. You can work with multiple Audio Mixers, send a mixer's output to a parent mixer, and save mix preferences as <span class="strong"><strong>Snapshots</strong></span>. Also, you can <a id="id932" class="indexterm"></a>access mixer parameters from scripting. The following figure represents the main Unity 5 audio mixing concepts and their relationships:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784391362/graphics/1362_09_01.jpg" /></div><p>Taking advantage of the new Audio Mixer feature in many example projects, this chapter is filled with recipes that will hopefully help you implement a better and more efficient sound design for your projects, augmenting the player's sense of immersion, transporting him or her into the game environment, and even improving the gameplay.</p></div></div>
