We also did a little work with AI. This was perhaps one of the simplest types of AI, but chase behaviors are highly important to all types of games. To utilize all of this, we created an enemy tank. It chased the player and shot at them to reduce their score. To give the edge back to the player, we gave health to the enemy tanks. The player could then shoot the enemy tanks as well as the targets for points. We also created some spawn points so that every time a tank was destroyed, a new one would be created. In terms of general game play, our Tank Battle game is pretty much complete.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will create a new game. In order to explore some of the special features of the mobile platform, we will create a Monkey Ball game. We will remove nearly all of the buttons from the screen in favor of new control methods. We will be turning the device's tilt sensors into our steering method. In addition, we will use the touchscreen to destroy enemies or collect bananas.</p></div>
