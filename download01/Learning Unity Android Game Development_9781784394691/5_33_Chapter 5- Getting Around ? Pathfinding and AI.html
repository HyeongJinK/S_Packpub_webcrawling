We added skybox, lights, and shadows to our Tank Battle game. We created lightmaps to make our scene dynamic. We took a look at cookies by giving our tank headlights. We also took a look at projectors by creating a blob shadow for the tank. A turbo boost was also created for the tank. By adjusting the viewing angle of the camera, we were able to make the tank look as if it was going much faster than it really was. When we finished the chapter, we had a dynamic and exciting-looking scene.</p><p>This chapter is all about the enemy. No longer will the player be able to just sit in one place to gather points. We will be adding an enemy tank to the game. By using Unity's NavMesh system, the tanks will be able to do pathfinding and chase the player. Once the player is found, the tanks will shoot and reduce the player's score.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>NavMesh</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>NavMeshAgent</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pathfinding</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Chase and attack AI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Spawn points</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be adding modifications to the Tank Battle game from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting the Stage – Camera Effects and Lighting</em></span>, so load it up and we can begin.</p></div>
