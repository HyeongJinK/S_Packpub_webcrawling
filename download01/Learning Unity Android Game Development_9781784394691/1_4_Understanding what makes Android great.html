Apple may have been the first one out of the gate with their iPhone sensation, but Android is definitely a step ahead when it comes to smartphone technology. One of its best features is its blatant ability to be opened up so that you can take a look at how the phone works, both physically and technically. One can swap out the battery and upgrade the micro SD card on nearly all Android devices, should the need arise. Plugging the phone into a computer does not have to be a huge ordeal; it can simply function as a removable storage media.</p><p>From the point of view of <a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a>the cost of development as well, the Android market is superior. Other mobile app stores require an annual registration fee of about 100 dollars. Some also have a limit on the number of devices that can be registered for development at one time. The Google Play market has a one-time registration fee of 25 dollars, and there is no concern about how many Android devices or what type of Android devices you are using for development.</p><p>One of the drawbacks of some of the other mobile development kits is that you have to pay an annual registration fee before you have access to the SDK. With some, registration and payment are required before you can view their documentation. Android is much more open and accessible. Anybody can download the Android SDK for free. The documentation and forums are completely viewable without having to pay any fee. This means development for Android can start earlier, with device testing being a part of it from the very beginning.</p></div>
