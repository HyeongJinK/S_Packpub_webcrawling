Nearly all game engines currently on the market are limited in what one can build with them. It makes perfect sense but it can limit the capabilities of a team. The average game engine has been highly optimized for creating a specific game type. This is great if all you plan on making is the same game again and again. It can be quite frustrating when one is struck with inspiration for the next great hit, only to find that the game engine can't handle it and<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> everyone has to retrain in a new engine or double the development time to make the game engine capable. Unity does not suffer from this problem. The developers of Unity have worked very hard to optimize every aspect of the engine, without limiting what types of games can be made using it. Everything ranging from simple 2D platformers to massive online role-playing games are possible in Unity. A development team that just finished an ultrarealistic first-person shooter can turn right around and make 2D fighting games without having to learn an entirely new system.</p><p>Being so open-ended does, however, bring a drawback. There are no default tools that are optimized for building the perfect game. To combat this, Unity grants the ability to create any tool one can imagine, using the same scripting that creates the game. On top of that, there is a strong community of users that have supplied a wide selection of tools and pieces, both free and paid, that can be quickly plugged in and used. This results in a large selection of available content that is ready to jump-start you on your way to the next great game.</p><p>When many prospective users look at Unity, they think that, because it is so cheap, it is not as good as an expensive AAA game engine. This is simply not true. Throwing more money at the game engine is not going to make a game any better. Unity supports all of the fancy shaders, normal maps, and particle effects that you could want. The best part is that nearly all of the fancy features that you could want are included in the free version of Unity, and 90 percent of the time beyond that, you do not even need to use the Pro-only features.</p><p>One of the greatest concerns when selecting a game engine, especially for the mobile market, is how much girth it will add to the final build size. Most game engines are quite hefty. With Unity's code stripping, the final build size of the project becomes quite small. Code stripping is the process by which Unity removes every extra little bit of code from the compiled libraries. A blank project compiled for Android that utilizes full code stripping ends up being around 7 megabytes.</p><p>Perhaps one of the coolest features of Unity is its multi-platform compatibility. With a single project, one can build for several different platforms. This includes the ability to simultaneously target mobiles, PCs, and consoles. This allows you to focus on real issues, such as handling inputs, resolution, and performance.</p><p>In the past, if a company desired to deploy their product on more than one platform, they had to nearly double the development costs in order to essentially reprogram the game. Every platform did, and still does, run by its own logic and language. Thanks to Unity, game development has never been simpler. We can develop games using simple and fast scripting, letting Unity handle the complex translation to each platform.</p></div>
