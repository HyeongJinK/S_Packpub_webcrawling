We created a clone of <span class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span>. The birds utilized physics to fly through the air and destroy the pigs and their structures. We utilized parallax scrolling to make a pleasing background effect. We also created a level selection screen, from which you can load the game's various scenes.</p><p>In this chapter, we return to the Monkey Ball game. We are going to add <a id="id465" class="indexterm"></a>many special effects that will round out the game experience. We will start by learning about the controls that Unity provides when working with audio. We will then move on to add some background music to the game and movement sounds for our monkey. Next, we will learn about particle systems, creating a dust trail for the monkey. Finally, we combine the effects explained in the chapter to create explosions for when the user collects bananas.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following important topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Importing audio clips</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Playing SFX</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understanding 2D and 3D SFX</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating particle systems</p></li></ul></div><p>Open up your Monkey Ball project and let's get started.</p></div>
