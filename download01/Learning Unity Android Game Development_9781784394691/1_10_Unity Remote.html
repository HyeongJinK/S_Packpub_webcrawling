It allows developers to connect their Android-powered devices to the Unity Editor and provide mobile inputs for testing. This is a definite must for any aspiring Unity and Android developer. If you are using a non-Amazon device, acquiring <a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a>Unity Remote is quite easy. At the time of writing this book, it could be found on Google Play at <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote</a>. It is free and does nothing but connects your Android device to the Unity Editor, so the app permissions are negligible. In fact, there are currently two versions of Unity Remote. To connect to Unity 4.5 and later versions, we must use Unity Remote 4.</p><p>If, however, you like the ever-growing Amazon market or seek to target Amazon's line of Android devices, adding Unity Remote will become a little trickier. First, you need to download a special <a id="id90" class="indexterm"></a>Unity Package from the <a id="id91" class="indexterm"></a>Unity Asset Store. It can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18106" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18106</a>. You will need to import the package into a fresh project and build it from there. Import the package by going to the top of Unity, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package</strong></span>, and then navigate to where you saved it. In the next section, we will build a simple application and put it on our device. After you have imported the package, follow along from the step where we open the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window, replacing the simple application with the created APK.</p></div>
