In the broadest sense, this is anything an inanimate object might do to appear to be making decisions. You are probably most familiar with this concept from video games. When a character, not controlled by the player, selects a weapon to use and a target to use it on, this is AI.</p><p>In its most complex form, AI <a id="id299" class="indexterm"></a>attempts to mimic full human intelligence and learning. However, there is still far too much happening incredibly fast for this to truly succeed. Video games do not need to reach this far. We are primarily concerned with making our characters appear intelligent but still conquerable by our players. Usually, this means not allowing characters to act on more information than what a real player might have. Adjusting how much information characters have and can act on is a good way to adjust the level of difficulty in a game.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Pathfinding</strong></span><a id="id300" class="indexterm"></a> is a subset of AI. We use it all the time, though you have probably never realized it. Pathfinding is, as the word suggests, the act of finding a path. Every time you need to find your way between any two points, you are doing pathfinding. As far as our characters are concerned, the simplest form of pathfinding is to follow a straight line to the goal point. Obviously, this method works best on an open plain, but tends to fail when there are any obstacles in the way. Another method is to overlay the game with a grid. Using the grid, we can find a path that goes around any obstacles and reaches our target.</p><p>An alternative method to pathfinding, and perhaps the one most often chosen, makes use of a special navigation mesh, or NavMesh. This is just a special model that is never seen by the player but covers all of the area that a computer character can move around in. The player is then navigated in a way that is similar to the grid; the difference is that the triangles of the mesh are used rather than the squares of the grid. This is the method that we will be using in Unity. Unity provides a nice set of tools for creating the NavMesh and utilizing it.</p></div>
