<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"></a>Messing with fonts</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now<a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a> that we have a basic working game, we need to make it look a little better. We are going to add our button images and pick some new font sizes and colors to make everything more readable:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Let's start with the buttons. Select one of the Button elements and you will see in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> that it is made of an <span class="strong"><strong>Image (Script)</strong></span> component and a <span class="strong"><strong>Button (Script)</strong></span> component. The first component controls how the GUI element will appear when it just sits there. The second controls how it changes when a player interacts with it and what bit of functionality this triggers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Source Image</strong></span>: This is the base image that is displayed when the element just sits there and is untouched by the player.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span>: This controls the tinting and fading of the image that is being used.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>: This lets you use a texture or shader that might otherwise be used on 3D models.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Image Type</strong></span>: This determines how the image will be stretched to fill the available space. Usually, it will be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sliced</strong></span>, which is for images <a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>that use a border and can be optionally filled with a color based on the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Center</strong></span> checkbox. Otherwise, it will often be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Simple</strong></span>, for example, when you are using a normal image and can prevent the <span class="strong"><strong>Preserve Aspect</strong></span> box from being stretched by odd sized Rect Transforms.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Interactable</strong></span>: This simply toggles whether or not the player is able to click on the button and trigger functionality.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Transition</strong></span>: This changes how the button will react as the player interacts with it. <span class="strong"><strong>ColorTint</strong></span> causes the button to change color as it is interacted with. <span class="strong"><strong>SpriteSwap</strong></span> will change the image when it is interacted with. <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> will let you define more complex animation sequences for the transitions between states.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Target Graphic</strong></span> is a reference to the base image used for drawing the button on screen.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Normal</strong></span> slot, <span class="strong"><strong>Highlighted</strong></span> slot, <span class="strong"><strong>Pressed</strong></span> slot, and <span class="strong"><strong>Disabled</strong></span> slot define the effects or images to use when the button is not being interacted with or is moused over, or the player clicks on it and the button has been turned off.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>For each of our buttons, we need to drag our <span class="strong"><strong>ButtonNormal</strong></span> image from our <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <span class="strong"><strong>Source Image</strong></span> slot.</p></li><li><p>Next, click on the white box to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> slot to open the color picker. To stop our buttons from being faded, we need to move the <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> slider all the way to the right or set the box to <code class="literal">255</code>.</p></li><li><p>We want to change images when our buttons are pressed, so change the <span class="strong"><strong>Transition</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>SpriteSwap</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Mobile devices have almost no way of hovering over GUI elements, so we do not need to worry about the <span class="strong"><strong>Highlighted</strong></span> state. However, we do want to add our <span class="strong"><strong>ButtonActive</strong></span> image to the <span class="strong"><strong>Pressed Sprite</strong></span> slot so that it will switch when the player touches the button.</p></li><li><p>The <a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a>button squares should be blank until someone clicks on them, so we need to get rid of the text element. The easiest way to do this is to select each one under the button and delete it.</p></li><li><p>Next, we need to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> child of each of the image elements. It is the <span class="strong"><strong>Text (Script)</strong></span> component that allows us to control how text is drawn on screen.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span>: This is the area where we can change text that will be drawn on screen.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Font</strong></span>: This allows us to pick any font file that is in our project to use for the text.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Font Style</strong></span>: This will let you adjust the bold and italic nature of the text.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span>: This is the size of the text. This is just like picking a font size in your favorite word processor.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Line Spacing</strong></span>: This is the distance between each line of text.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Rich Text</strong></span>: This will let you use a few special HTML style tags to affect only part of the text with a color, italics, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: This changes the location where the text will be centered in the box. The first three boxes adjust the horizontal position. The second three change the vertical position.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal Overflow / Vertical Overflow</strong></span>: These adjust whether the text can be drawn outside the box, wrapped to a new line, or clipped off.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Best Fit</strong></span>: This will automatically adjust the size of the text to fit a dynamically size-changing element, within a <span class="strong"><strong>Min</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> value.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Color/Material</strong></span>: These change the color and texture of the text as and when it is drawn.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Shadow (Script)</strong></span>: This component adds a drop shadow to the text, just like what you might add in Photoshop.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>For each of our text elements, we need to use a <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> of <code class="literal">120</code> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span> should be centered.</p></li><li><p>For the <span class="strong"><strong>Turn Indicator</strong></span> text element, we also need to use a <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> of <code class="literal">120</code> and it also needs to be centered.</p></li><li><p>The last <a id="id125" class="indexterm"></a>thing to do is to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> of the text elements to a dark gray so that we can easily see it against the color of our buttons:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_02_07.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, our board works and looks good, too. Try taking a stab at adding your own images for the buttons. You will need two images, one for when the button sits there and one for when the button is pressed. Also, the default Arial font is boring. Find a new font to use for your game; you can import it just like any other game asset.</p></div>
