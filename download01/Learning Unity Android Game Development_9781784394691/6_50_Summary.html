We created a Monkey Ball game to try this out. We gained access to the device's gyroscope to detect when it is rotated. This gave our monkey the ability to be directed. After creating a more complex and interesting environment for the player to move around, we created a bunch of bananas that bob up and down while spinning in place. We also made use of the touch screen to give the player the ability to collect the bananas.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be taking a short break from our Monkey Ball game. One of the most popular mobile games on the market, Angry Birds, is a distinct and not uncommon type of game. In order to learn about physics in Unity and the possibility of a 2D-style game, we will be making an Angry Birds clone. We will also take a look at Parallax scrolling to help us create a pleasing background. Before you know it, we will be creating all of the Angry Birds levels that you always wished you could play.</p></div>
