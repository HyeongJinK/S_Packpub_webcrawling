The process is similar to the one that we used for making lightmaps. We just mark some meshes to be used, adjust some settings in a special window, and hit a button. So, load up the Tank Battle game in Unity if you haven't already done so, and we can get started.</p><p>Unity can automatically generate a NavMesh from any meshes that exist in a scene. To do so, the mesh must first be marked as static, just as we did for lightmaps. However, we do not want or need to be able to navigate the roofs of our city, so we make use of a special list of settings to dictate what type of static each object will be. Let's start with the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the city from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window and click on the down arrow to the right of <span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>We can take a look at <a id="id302" class="indexterm"></a>the options available for static objects as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Nothing</strong></span>: This option is used to quickly deselect all the other options. If all the other options are unchecked, this one will be checked.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Everything</strong></span>: Using this option, you can quickly select all the other options. When all of them are checked, this one will also be checked. The checkbox next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span> label in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window performs the same function as checking and unchecking the <span class="strong"><strong>Everything</strong></span> checkbox.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Lightmap Static</strong></span>: This option needs to be checked when working with lightmaps in order for them to work. Any mesh that does not have this checked will not be lightmapped.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Occluder Static</strong></span>: This is an option for working with occlusion. <span class="strong"><strong>Occlusion</strong></span><a id="id303" class="indexterm"></a> is a method of runtime optimization that involves only rendering objects that can actually be seen, whether or not they are within the camera's view space. An <span class="strong"><strong>occluder</strong></span><a id="id304" class="indexterm"></a> is an object that will block other objects from being seen. It works in conjunction with the <span class="strong"><strong>Occludee Static</strong></span> option. The best object choices for this option are large and solid.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Batching Static</strong></span>: This is another option for runtime optimization. Batching is the act of grouping objects together before rendering them. It greatly increases the overall render speed of a game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Navigation Static</strong></span>: This is the option that we are primarily concerned with at this point. Any mesh that has this option checked will be used when calculating the NavMesh.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Occludee Static</strong></span>: As mentioned a moment ago, this option works in conjunction with <span class="strong"><strong>Occluder Static</strong></span> for the good of occlusion. An <span class="strong"><strong>occludee</strong></span><a id="id305" class="indexterm"></a> is an object that will be obscured by other objects. When covered by an occluder, this object will not be drawn.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Off Mesh Link Generation</strong></span>: This option also works with the NavMesh calculation. An off-mesh link is a connection between two parts of the NavMesh that aren't physically connected, such as the roof and the street. Using a few settings in the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> window and this option, the links are automatically generated.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Reflection Probe Static</strong></span>: The last option allows the object to be recorded by reflection probes. These record everything around them and generate a cubemap that can be used by reflective shaders.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>In order to make the <a id="id306" class="indexterm"></a>NavMesh work properly, we need to change the settings so that only the streets of the city can be navigated. When was the last time you saw a tank jump or fall from the roof of a building? So, we need to change the static options so that only the streets have <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation Static</strong></span> checked. This can be done in one of the following two ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The first way is to go through and uncheck the option for each object that we want changed.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The second is to uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation Static</strong></span> for the top-level object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window, and when Unity asks whether we want to make the change for all children objects, reply with a yes. Then, go to just the objects that we want to navigate and recheck the option.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Now, open the <a id="id307" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> window by going to Unity's toolbar and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> at the bottom of the menu. The following screenshot displays the window where all the work of making the NavMesh happens:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_05_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>This window <a id="id308" class="indexterm"></a>consists of three pages and a variety of settings:</p><p>When an object is selected, the settings will appear on the <span class="strong"><strong>Object</strong></span> page. The two checkboxes correspond directly with the <span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span> options of the same name that we set a moment ago. The drop-down list in <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation Area</strong></span> lets us group different parts of our NavMesh. These groups can be used to affect the pathfinding calculation. For example, a car can be set to only travel on the road area and the human can follow the sidewalk area.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> page is the one that we are interested in; it is full of options to change how the NavMesh will be generated. It even includes a nice visual representation of the various settings at the top:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Agent Radius</strong></span>: This should be set to the size of the thinnest character. It is used to keep characters from walking too close to walls.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Agent Height</strong></span>: This is the height of your characters. Using this, Unity can calculate and remove areas that are too low for them to pass. Anything lower than this value is deemed too small, so it should be set to the height of your shortest character.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Max Slope</strong></span>: Anything steeper than this value is ignored when calculating the NavMesh.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Step Height</strong></span>: When making use of stairs, one must use this value. This is the maximum height of a stair that a character can step on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Drop Height</strong></span>: This is the height from which characters can fall. With it, paths will include jumping off ledges, if it is faster to do so.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jump Distance</strong></span>: Using this value, characters can jump across gaps in the NavMesh. This value represents the longest distance that can be jumped.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Manual Voxel Size / Voxel Size</strong></span>: By checking the <span class="strong"><strong>Manual Voxel Size</strong></span> box, you can adjust the value of <span class="strong"><strong>Voxel Size</strong></span>. This is a level of detail for the NavMesh. Lower values will make it more accurate to the visible mesh, but it will take longer to calculate and require more memory to store.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Min Region Area</strong></span>: If parts of the NavMesh are smaller than this value, they will not be used in the final NavMesh.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Height Mesh</strong></span>: With this option checked, the original height information is maintained in NavMesh. Unless you have a special need for it, this option should remain off. It takes the system longer to calculate and requires more memory to store.</p></li></ul></div><p>The third page, <span class="strong"><strong>Areas</strong></span>, allows<a id="id309" class="indexterm"></a> us to adjust the cost of movement for each of our defined areas. Essentially, how difficult is it to move though different parts of our game world? With cars, we could adjust the layers so that it is twice as costly for them to move through the field than to move along the road.</p><p>At the bottom of the window, we have the following two buttons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Clear</strong></span>: This button removes the previously created NavMesh. After using this button, you will need to rebake the NavMesh before you can make use of pathfinding again.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span>: This button starts the work and creates the NavMesh.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Our city is very simple, so the default values will suit us well enough. Hit <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> and watch the progress bar in the bottom-right corner. Once it is done, a blue mesh will appear. This is the NavMesh and it represents all of the area that a character can move through.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"></a>Tip</h3><p>It may happen that your tanks will poke through the walls of the buildings a little as they move around. If they do, increase the <span class="strong"><strong>Agent Radius</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> window until they no longer do this.</p></div></li><li><p>There is one last thing we need to do. Our NavMesh is just right, but if you look closely, it goes through the fountain at the center of the city. It would be just wrong if enemy tanks start driving through the fountain. To fix this, start by selecting the mesh that forms the wall around the fountain.</p></li><li><p>In Unity's toolbar, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span>, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span>, and finally <span class="strong"><strong>Nav Mesh Obstacle</strong></span>. This simply adds a component that tells the navigation system to go around when searching for a path. Since we had already selected the wall, the new component will be sized to fit; we just need to select <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span> drop-down list. You can see it represented as a wire cylinder in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_05_03.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>We created the NavMesh. We <a id="id310" class="indexterm"></a>made use of the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> window and the <span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span> options to tell Unity which meshes to use when calculating the NavMesh. The Unity team put a lot of work into making this process quick and easy.</p><p>Remember, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Backbone of Any Game – Meshes, Materials, and Animations</em></span>, when the challenge was to create obstacles for the player, you were encouraged to create additional meshes, such as tank traps and rubble. It would be a bad idea to let the enemy tanks drive through these as well. So, have a go at turning these into obstacles for the navigation system. This will be done just as with the fountain.</p></div>
