We expanded our Tank Battle game to include enemy tanks. We created points for them to spawn at and made them shoot at the player. In addition, the player was given the ability to destroy the tanks. Once they were destroyed, the player received some points and a new enemy tank was spawned.</p><p>In this chapter, we will work on a new game as we explore some of the specialties of mobile devices. We will create a <span class="strong"><strong>Monkey Ball</strong></span> game. The player will take control of a monkey in an oversized hamster ball and try to reach the end of the maze before time runs out, while collecting bananas. To move around, they will have to tilt the mobile device. To collect bananas, the player will have to touch the screen where the banana is.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Touch controls</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tilt controls</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Monkey Ball game</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be creating a new project for this chapter, so start Unity and we will begin.</p></div>
