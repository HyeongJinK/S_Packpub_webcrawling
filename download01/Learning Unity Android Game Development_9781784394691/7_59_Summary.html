Using Unity's physics system, we are able to make all the levels that we will ever want to play. With this game, we also explored Unity's 2D pipeline for creating great 2D games. Our birds and slingshot are 3D assets, giving us the ability to light and shade them. The pigs and background, however, are 2D images, reducing our lighting options but allowing greater detail in the assets. The 2D images were also crucial in the creation of the parallax scrolling effect of the background. Finally, the blocks that make up the levels appear to be 2D but are actually 3D blocks. We also created a level-selection screen. From here, the player can see their high scores and pick any of the levels that we created.</p><p>In the next chapter, we return to the Monkey Ball game we started in the previous chapter. We are going to create and add all of the special effects that finish off a game. We will add the bouncing and popping sound effects that every Monkey Ball game needs. We will also add various particle effects. When the bananas are collected, they will create a small explosion, rather than just disappearing.</p></div>
