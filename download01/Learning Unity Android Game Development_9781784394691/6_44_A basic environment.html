When working with new control schemes, it is always best to work in a simple and well-controlled environment before introducing the complexities of a real level. Let's make ours with these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to the top of Unity and select <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object </strong></span>to create a new cube, which will be the base of our basic environment. Rename it as <code class="literal">Ground</code> so that we can keep track of it.</p></li><li><p>Set the cube's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel to <code class="literal">0</code> on each axis, allowing us to work around the world origin. Also, set its <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> to <code class="literal">10</code>, giving us enough space to move around and test our monkey.</p></li><li><p>Next, we need a second cube, named <code class="literal">Fence</code>. This cube should have a <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> value of <code class="literal">-5</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <code class="literal">1</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <code class="literal">0</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>, along with a scale of <code class="literal">0.2</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> and <code class="literal">10</code> for <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>With <code class="literal">Fence</code> <a id="id338" class="indexterm"></a>selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window, you can hit <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> on your keyboard to make a duplicate. We are going to need a total of four, positioned along each side of our <code class="literal">Ground</code> cube:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_06_01.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>We now have a basic testing environment that will allow us to work with our controls and not worry about all the complexities of a whole level. Once our controls work in this environment the way we want them to, we will introduce our monkey to a new environment.</p></div>
