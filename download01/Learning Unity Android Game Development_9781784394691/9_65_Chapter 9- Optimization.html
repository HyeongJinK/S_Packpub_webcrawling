We added background music to our Monkey Ball game. We also created dust trails for our monkey. By combining both audio effects and particle systems, we created explosions when a player collects a banana. Together, these round out the game experience and give us a very complete-looking game.</p><p>In this chapter, we explore our options for optimization. We start by looking at the application footprint and how to reduce it. We then move on to look at the game's performance even further. Finally, we explore some key areas that can cause lag and look at how we can minimize their effects.</p><p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Minimizing the application footprint</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tracking performance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Minimizing lag</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Occlusion culling</p></li></ul></div><p>For this chapter, we will be working on both our Monkey Ball and Tank Battle games. Start the chapter by opening the Monkey Ball project.</p></div>
