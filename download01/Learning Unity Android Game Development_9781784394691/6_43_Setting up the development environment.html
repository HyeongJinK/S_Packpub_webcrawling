Don't worry; the setup for this chapter is simple and straightforward. Let's follow these steps to do it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The first step is, of course, to start Unity and create a new project. It will need to be a 3D project and naming it <code class="literal">Ch6_MonkeyBall</code> will work well.</p></li><li><p>Once Unity has finished initializing, this is the perfect opportunity to set our build settings. Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Android</strong></span> from the list of platforms and hit <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> to change the target platform.</p></li><li><p>While you are in the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> to open the player settings in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span>, and, most importantly, the <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>When a user tilts their device, the whole screen will adjust its orientation when a new side becomes the bottom. Since the whole game is based around tilting the device, the screen orientation might change at any moment when a player is playing and thus spoil their game. Therefore, in <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span>, find the <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution </strong></span><a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>and Presentation</strong></span> section and ensure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Orientation</strong></span> is not set to <span class="strong"><strong>Auto Rotation</strong></span>, which would cause Unity to change a game's orientation when we are playing. Any of the other options will work for us here.</p></li><li><p>We need to create a few folders to keep the project organized. The <code class="literal">Scripts</code>, <code class="literal">Models</code>, and <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folders should be created in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window. Since we may end up with dozens of levels and maps in the future, it would be a good idea to make a <code class="literal">Scenes</code> folder as well.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, we must import the assets for this project. We are going to need a monkey for the player, a banana to collect, a sample map, and some fences. Luckily, all of these have already been prepared and are available with the starting assets for this chapter. Import <code class="literal">Monkey.blend</code>, <code class="literal">Monkey.psd</code>, <code class="literal">Ball.psd</code>, <code class="literal">Banana.blend</code>, <code class="literal">Banana.psd</code>, <code class="literal">MonkeyBallMap.blend</code>, <code class="literal">Grass.psd</code>, <code class="literal">Fence.blend</code>, and <code class="literal">Wood.psd</code> to the <code class="literal">Models</code> folder that you just created.</p></li></ol></div><p>We have just finished the setup for this chapter's project. Once again, a little bit of effort at the beginning of the project will save time and avoid frustration later; as the project grows in size, the organization done at the beginning becomes very important.</p></div>
