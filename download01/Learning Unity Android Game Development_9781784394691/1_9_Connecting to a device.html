Since there are so many different kinds of devices, it can get a little tricky at times just to have the device recognized by your computer.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"></a>A simple device connection</h3></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a> simple device connection method involves changing a few settings and a little work in the command prompt. It may seem a little scary, but if all goes well you will be connected to your device shortly:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The first thing you need to do is turn on the phone's <span class="strong"><strong>Developer options</strong></span>. In the latest version of Android, these have been hidden. Go to your phone's settings page and find the <span class="strong"><strong>About phone</strong></span> page.</p></li><li><p>Next, you need to find the <span class="strong"><strong>Build number</strong></span> information slot and tap it several times. At first, it will appear to do nothing, but  it will shortly display that you need to press the button a few more times to activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Developer options</strong></span>. The Android team did this so that the average user does not accidentally make changes.</p></li><li><p>Now go back to your settings page and there should be a new <span class="strong"><strong>Developer options</strong></span> page; select it now. This page controls all of the settings you might need to change while developing your applications.</p></li><li><p>The only checkbox we are really concerned with checking right now is <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span>. This allows us to actually detect our device from the development environment.</p></li><li><p>If you are using Kindle, be sure to go into <span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> and turn on <span class="strong"><strong>Enable ADB</strong></span> as well.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>There are several warning pop-ups that are associated with turning on these various options. They essentially amount to the same malicious software warnings associated with your computer. Applications with immoral intentions can mess with your system and get to your private information. All these settings need to be turned on if your device is only going to be used for development. However, as the warnings suggest, if malicious applications are a concern, turn them off when you are not developing.</p></div></li><li><p>Next, open <a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a>a command prompt on your computer. This can be done most easily by hitting your Windows key, typing <code class="literal">cmd.exe</code>, and then hitting <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>We now need to navigate to the ADB commands. If you did not install the SDK to the default location, replace the path in the following commands with the path where you installed it.</p><p>If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows and installed the SDK to the default location, type the following in the command prompt:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>cd c:\program files\android\android-sdk\platform-tools</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If you are running a 64-bit version, type the following in the command prompt:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>cd c:\program files (x86)\android\android-sdk\platform-tools</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>Now, connect your device to your computer, preferably using the USB cable that came with it.</p></li><li><p>Wait for your computer to finish recognizing the device. There should be a <span class="strong"><strong>Device drivers installed</strong></span> type of message pop-up when it is done.</p></li><li><p>The following command lets us see which devices are currently connected and recognized by the ADB system. Emulated devices will show up as well. Type the following in the command prompt:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>adb devices</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>After a short pause for processing, the command prompt will display a list of attached devices along with the unique IDs of all the attached devices. If this list now contains your device, congratulations! You have a developer-friendly device. If it is not completely developer-friendly, there is one more thing that you can try before things get tricky.</p></li><li><p>Go to the top of your device and open your system notifications. There should be one that looks like the USB symbol. Selecting it will open the connection settings. There are a few options here and by default Android selects to connect the Android device as a <span class="strong"><strong>Media Device</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We <a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a>need to connect our device as a <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span>. The reason is the connection method used. Usually, this will allow your computer to connect.</p></li></ol></div><p>We have completed our first attempt at connecting  to our Android devices. For most, this should be all that you need to connect to your device. For some, this process is not quite enough. The next little section covers solutions to resolve the issue for connecting trickier devices.</p><p>For trickier devices, there are a few general things that we can try; if these steps fail to connect your device, you may need to do some special research.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Start by typing the following commands. These will restart the connection system and display the list of devices again:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>adb kill-server</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>adb start-server</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>adb devices</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>If you are still not having any luck, try the following commands. These commands force an update and restart the connection system:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>cd ../tools</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>android update adb</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>cd ../platform-tools</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>adb kill-server</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>adb start-server</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>adb devices</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>If your device is still not showing up, you have one of the most annoying and tricky devices. Check the manufacturer's website for data syncing and management programs. If you have had your device for quite some time, you have probably been prompted to install this more than once. If you have not already done so, install the latest version even if you never plan on using it. The point is to obtain the latest drivers for your device, and this is the easiest way.</p></li><li><p>Restart the connection system again using the first set of commands and cross your fingers!</p></li><li><p>If you are still unable to connect, the best, professional recommendation that can be made is to google for the solution to your problem. Conducting a search for your device's brand with <code class="literal">adb</code> at the end should turn up a step-by-step tutorial that is specific to your device in the first couple of results. Another excellent resource for finding out all about the nitty-gritties of Android devices <a id="id86" class="indexterm"></a>can be found at<a class="ulink" href="http://www.xda-developers.com/" target="_blank">http://www.xda-developers.com/</a>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Some of the <a id="id87" class="indexterm"></a>devices that you will encounter while developing will not connect easily. We just covered some quick steps and managed to connect these devices. If we could have covered the processes for every device, we would have. However, the variety of devices is just too large and the manufacturers keep making more.</p></div></div>
