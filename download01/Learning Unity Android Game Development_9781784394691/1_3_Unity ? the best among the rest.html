Two major ones that come to mind are<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>cocos2d</strong></span> and <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span>. While both are excellent choices, you will find them to be a little lacking in certain respects.</p><p>The engine of Angry Birds, cocos2d, could be a great choice for your next mobile hit. However, as the name suggests, it is pretty much limited to 2D games. A game can look great in it, but if you ever want that third dimension, it can be tricky to add it to cocos2d; you may need to select a new game engine. A second major problem with cocos2d is how bare bones it is. Any tool for building or importing assets needs to be created from scratch, or it needs to be found. Unless you have the time and experience, this can seriously slow down development.</p><p>Then there is the staple of major game development, Unreal Engine. This game engine has been used successfully by developers for many years, bringing great games to the world Unreal Tournament and Gears of War not the least among them. These are both, however, console and computer games, which is the fundamental problem with the engine. Unreal is a very large and powerful engine. Only so much optimization can be done on it for mobile platforms. It has always had the same problem; it adds a lot of girth to a project and its final build. The other major issue with Unreal is its rigidity in being a first-person shooter engine. While it is technically possible to create other types of games in it, such tasks are long and complex. A strong working knowledge of the underlying system is a must before achieving such a feat.</p><p>All in all, Unity definitely stands strong amidst game engines. Perhaps, you have already discovered this and that is why you are reading this book. But these are still great reasons for choosing Unity for game development. Unity projects can look just as great as AAA titles. The overhead and girth in the final build are small and this is very important when working on mobile platforms. The system's potential is open enough to allow you to create any type of game that you might want, where other engines tend to be limited to a single type of game. In addition, should your needs change at any point in the project's life cycle, it is very easy to add, remove, or change your choice of target platforms.</p></div>
