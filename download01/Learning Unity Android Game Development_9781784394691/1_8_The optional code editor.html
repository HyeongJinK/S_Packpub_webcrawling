Unity comes with a system called <a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>. It is similar in many respects to <a id="id79" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Visual Studio</strong></span>. And like Visual Studio, it adds many extra files and much girth to a project, all of which it needs to operate. All this extra girth makes it take an annoying amount of time to start up, before one can actually get to the code.</p><p>Technically, you<a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a> can get away with a plain text editor, as Unity doesn't really care. This book recommends using <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>Notepad++, which is found at <a class="ulink" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download" target="_blank">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download</a>. It is free to use and it is essentially Notepad with code highlighting. There are several fancy widgets and add-ons for Notepad++ that add even greater functionality to it, but they are not necessary for following this book. If you choose this alternative, installing Notepad++ to the default location will work just fine.</p></div>
