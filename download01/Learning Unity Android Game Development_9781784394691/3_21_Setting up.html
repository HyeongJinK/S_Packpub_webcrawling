You will need a number of starting assets for this project; they will be described during the setup process. Due to the complexity and specific nature of these assets, it is recommended to use the ones provided with the code bundle of this book for now.</p><p>As we did in the previous two chapters, we will need to create a new project so that we can create our next game. Obviously, the first thing to do is to start a new Unity project. For organizational purposes, name it <code class="literal">Ch3_TankBattle</code>. The following points are the prerequisites that are required for this project to kick-start:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>This project will also grow to become much larger than our previous projects, so we should create some folders to keep things organized. For starters, create six folders. The top-level folders will be the <code class="literal">Models</code>, <code class="literal">Scripts</code>, and <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folders. Inside <code class="literal">Models</code>, create <code class="literal">Environment</code>, <code class="literal">Tanks</code>, and <code class="literal">Targets</code>. Having these folders makes the project significantly more manageable. Any complete model can consist of a mesh file, one or more textures, a material for every texture, and potentially dozens of animation files.</p></li><li><p>Before we continue, it is a good idea to change your target platform to Android, if you haven't already done so. Every time the target platform is changed, all of the assets in the project need to be reimported. This is an automatic step carried out by Unity, but it will take an increasing amount of time as our project grows. By setting our target platform before there is anything in the project, we save lots of time later.</p></li><li><p>We will also make use of a very powerful part of Unity: prefabs. These are special objects that make the process of creating a game significantly easier. The name means prefabricatedâ€”created beforehand and replicated. What this means for us is that we can completely set up a target for our tank to shoot at and turn it into a prefab. Then, we can place instances of the prefab throughout the game world. If we ever need to make a change to the targets, all we need to do is modify the original prefab. Any change made to a prefab is also made on any instance of that prefab. Don't worry; it makes more sense when it is used.</p></li><li><p>We will need to create some meshes and textures for this project. To start with, we will need a tank (it is kind of hard to have a battle of tanks without any tanks). The tank that is provided with this code bundle has a turret and cannon, which are separate pieces. We will also use a trick to make the tank's treads look like they are moving, so each of them are a separate piece and uses a separate texture.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we will need an animated target. The one that is provided with the code bundle of this book is rigged up like the human arm with a bull's eye for the hand. It has four animations. The first starts in a curled position and goes to an extended position. The second is the reverse of the first one, going from the extended position to the curled position. The third starts in the extended position and is flung back, as if it is hit in the front, and returns to the curled position. The last is just like the third one, but it goes forward as if it is hit from behind. These are fairly simple animations, but they will serve us well in learning about Unity's animation system.</p></li></ol></div><p>Very little <a id="id149" class="indexterm"></a>happened here; we simply created the project and added some folders. There was also a little discussion about the assets that we would be using for this chapter's project.</p></div>
