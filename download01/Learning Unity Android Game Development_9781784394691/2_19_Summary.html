We first became familiar with creating buttons and other objects to be drawn on the game's GUI Canvas. After delving into improving the look of our game, we continued to improve it when we added dynamic orientation to the game board. We created an opening and closing screen to round out the game experience. Finally, we explored an alternative build method for putting our game onto devices.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be starting a new and more complex game. The tank battle game we will create will be used to gain an understanding of the basic building blocks of any game: meshes, materials, and animations. When everything is done, we will be able to drive a tank around a colorful city and shoot animated targets.</p></div>
