We also created a Monkey Ball game to use these new controls. The steering of the ball was done by tilting the device and collecting bananas by touching the screen. We also gave it some win and lose conditions by creating a timer and finish line.</p><p>In this chapter, will we take a short break from the Monkey Ball game to explore Unity's physics engine. We will also take a look at the options available for creating a 2D game experience. To do all of this, we will be recreating one of the most popular mobile games on the market, <span class="strong"><strong>Angry Birds</strong></span>. We will use physics to throw birds and destroy structures. We will also take a look at the creation of a level-selection screen.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity physics</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Parallax scrolling</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>2D pipelines</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level selection</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be creating a new project for this chapter, so start up Unity and let's begin!</p></div>
