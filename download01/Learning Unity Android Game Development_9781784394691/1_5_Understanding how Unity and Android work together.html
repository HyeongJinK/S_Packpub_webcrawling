This means that you could easily start development with the free version of Unity and target personal computers. Then, at a later date, you can switch targets to the Android platform with the click of a button. Perhaps, shortly after your game is launched, it takes the market by storm and there is a great call to bring it to other mobile platforms. With just another click of the button, you can easily target iOS without changing anything in your project.</p><p>Most systems<a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a> require a long and complex set of steps to get your project running on a device. For the first application in this book, we will be going through that process because it is important to know about it. However, once your device is set up and recognized by the Android SDK, a single button click will allow Unity to build your application, push it to a device, and start running it. There is nothing that has caused more headaches for some developers than trying to get an application on a device. Unity makes this simple.</p><p>With the addition of a free Android application, <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Remote</strong></span>, it is <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>simple and easy to test mobile inputs without going through the whole build process. While developing, there is nothing more annoying than waiting for 5 minutes for a build every time you need to test a minor tweak, especially in the controls and interface. After the first dozen little tweaks, the build time starts to add up. Unity Remote makes it simple and easy to test everything without ever having to hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button.</p><p>These are the big three reasons why Unity works well with Android:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Generic projects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A one-click build process</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity Remote</p></li></ul></div><p>We could, of <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>course, come up with several more great ways in which Unity and Android <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>can work together. However, these three are the major time and money savers. You could have the greatest game in the world, but if it takes 10 times longer to build and test, what is the point?</p></div>
