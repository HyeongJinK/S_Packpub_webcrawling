We started by creating a simple Tic-tac-toe game to learn about the basic pieces of the game. We followed this by changing the look of the game and making the board handle multiple screen orientations. We completed with a few menus.</p><p>This chapter is about the core of any game: meshes, materials, and animations. Without these blocks, there is generally nothing to show to players. You could, of course, just use flat images in the GUI. But, where is the fun in that? If you are going to choose a 3D game engine, you might as well make full use of its capabilities.</p><p>To understand meshes, materials, and animations, we will be creating a tank battle game. This project will be used in a few other chapters. By the end of the book, it will be one of the two robust games that we will have created. For this chapter, the player will get to drive a tank around a small city, they will be able to shoot at animated targets, and we will also add a counter to track the scores.</p><p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Importing meshes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Animations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the prefabs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Ray tracing</p></li></ul></div><p>We will be starting a new project in this chapter, so follow the first section to get it started.</p></div>
