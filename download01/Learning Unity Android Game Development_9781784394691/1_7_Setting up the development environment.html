<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"></a>Setting up the development environment</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Before we <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>can create the next great game for Android, we need to install a few programs. In order to make the Android SDK work, we will first install the <span class="strong"><strong>Java Development Kit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JDK</strong></span>). Then we will install the Android SDK. After that, we will install Unity. We then have to install an optional code editor. To make sure everything is set up correctly, we will connect to our devices and take a look at some special strategies if the device is a tricky one. Finally, we will install Unity Remote, a program that will become invaluable in your mobile development.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"></a>Installing the JDK</h3></div></div></div><p>Android's development<a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a> language of choice is Java; so, to<a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a> develop for it, we need a copy of the <span class="strong"><strong>Java SE Development Kit</strong></span> on our computer. The process of installing the JDK is given in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The latest <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>version of the JDK can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>. So open the site in a web browser, and you will be able to see the screen showed in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_01_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Java Platform (JDK)</strong></span> from the available versions and you will be brought<a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a> to a page that contains the license agreement and allows you to select the type of file you wish to download.</p></li><li><p>Accept the license agreement and select your appropriate Windows version from the list at the bottom. If you are unsure about which version to choose, then <span class="strong"><strong>Windows x86</strong></span> is usually a safe choice.</p></li><li><p>Once the download is completed, run the new installer.</p></li><li><p>After a system scan, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> two times, the JDK will initialize, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button one more time to install the JDK to the default location. It is as good there as anywhere else, so once it is installed, hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Close</strong></span> button.</p></li></ol></div><p>We have just finished installing the <span class="strong"><strong>JDK</strong></span>. We need this so that our Android development kit will work. Luckily, the installation process for this keystone is short and sweet.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Installing the Android SDK</h3></div></div></div><p>In order<a id="id59" class="indexterm"></a> to actually develop and connect to our devices, we need to have installed the Android SDK. Having the SDK installed fulfills two<a id="id60" class="indexterm"></a> primary requirements. First, it makes sure that we have the bulk of the latest drivers for recognizing devices. Second, we are able to use the <a id="id61" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ADB</strong></span>). ADB is the system used for actually connecting to and interacting with a device. The process of installing the Android SDK is given in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The latest version of the Android SDK can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>, so open a web browser and go to the given site.</p></li><li><p>Once there, scroll to the bottom and find the <span class="strong"><strong>SDK Tools Only</strong></span> section. This is where we can get just the SDK, which we need to make Android games with Unity, without dealing with the fancy fluff of the Android Studio.</p></li><li><p>We need to select the <code class="literal">.exe</code> package with <span class="strong"><strong>(Recommended)</strong></span> underneath it (as shown in the following screenshot):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_01_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You will then be sent to a <span class="strong"><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></span> page. Read it if you prefer, but agree to it to continue. Then hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button to start downloading the installer.</p></li><li><p>Once it has finished downloading, start it up.</p></li><li><p>Hit the first <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button and the installer will try to find an appropriate version of the JDK. You will come to a page that will notify you about not finding the JDK if you do not have it installed.</p></li><li><p>If you <a id="id62" class="indexterm"></a>skipped ahead and do not have the JDK installed, hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Visit java.oracle.com</strong></span> button in the middle of the page and go back to the previous section for guidance on installing it. If you do have it, continue with the process.</p></li><li><p>Hitting <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> again <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>will bring you to a page that will ask you about the person for whom you are installing the SDK .</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Install for anyone using this computer</strong></span> because the default install location is easier to get to for later purposes.</p></li><li><p>Hit <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> twice, followed by <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to install the SDK to the default location.</p></li><li><p>Once this is done, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Finish</strong></span> to complete the installation of the Android SDK Manager.</p></li><li><p>If Android SDK Manager does not start right away, start it up. Either way, give it a moment to initialize. The SDK Manager makes sure that we have the latest drivers, systems, and tools for developing with the Android platform. However, we have to actually install them first (which can be done from the following screen):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_01_10.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>By default, the SDK manager should select a number of options to install. If not, select the latest Android API (Android L (API 20) as of the time of writing this book), <span class="strong"><strong>Android Support Library</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Google USB Driver</strong></span> found in <span class="strong"><strong>Extras</strong></span>. Be absolutely sure that <span class="strong"><strong>Android SDK Platform-tools</strong></span> is selected. This will be very important later. It actually includes the tools that we need to connect to our device.</p></li><li><p>Once <a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a>everything is selected, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Install packages</strong></span> at the bottom-right corner.</p></li><li><p>The next <a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a>screen is another set of license agreements. Every time a component is installed or updated through the SDK manager, you have to agree to the license terms before it gets installed. Accept all of the licenses and hit <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> to start the process.</p></li><li><p>You can now sit back and relax. It takes a while for the components to be downloaded and installed. Once this is all done, you can close it out. We have completed the process, but you should occasionally come back to it. Periodically checking the SDK manager for updates will make sure that you are using the latest tools and APIs.</p></li></ol></div><p>The installation of the <span class="strong"><strong>Android SDK </strong></span>is now finished. Without it, we would be completely unable to do anything on the Android platform. Aside from the long wait to download and install components, this was a pretty easy installation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"></a>Installing Unity 3D</h3></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the<a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a> most important part of this <a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a>whole book, without which none of the rest has meaning, is installing Unity. Perform the following steps to install Unity:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>The latest version <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a>of Unity can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.unity3d.com/unity/download" target="_blank">http://www.unity3d.com/unity/download</a>. As of the time of writing this book, the current version is 5.0.</p></li><li><p>Once it is downloaded, launch the installer and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> until you reach the <span class="strong"><strong>Choose Components</strong></span> page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_01_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Here, we <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>are able to select the<a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a> features of Unity installation. None of these options are actually necessary for following the rest of this book, but they warrant a look since Unity will ask for the components you wish to install every time you update or reinstall it:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Example Project</strong></span>: This is the current project built by Unity to show off some of its latest features. If you want to jump in early and take a look at what a complete Unity game can look like, leave this checked.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity Development Web Player</strong></span>: This is required if you plan on developing browser applications with Unity. As this book is focused on Android development, it is entirely optional. It is, however, a good one to check. You never know when you may need a web demo and since it is entirely free to develop for the web using Unity, there is no harm in having it.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>: It is a wise choice to leave this option unchecked. There is more detail in the next section, but it will suffice for now to say that it just adds an extra program for script editing that is not nearly as useful as it should be.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Once you <a id="id71" class="indexterm"></a>have selected or deselected your desired options, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span>. If you wish to follow the book exactly, note<a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a> that we will uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span> and leave the rest checked.</p></li><li><p>Next is the location of installation. The default location works well, so hit <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> and wait. This will take a couple of minutes, so sit back, relax, and enjoy your favorite beverage.</p></li><li><p>Once the installation is complete, the option to run Unity will be displayed. Leave it checked and hit <span class="strong"><strong>Finish</strong></span>. If you have never installed Unity before, you will be presented with a license activation page (as shown in the following screenshot):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784394691/graphics/4691OT_01_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>While <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>Unity does provide a feature-rich, free version, in order to follow the entirety of this book, one is required to make use of some of the Unity Pro features. At <a class="ulink" href="https://store.unity3d.com" target="_blank">https://store.unity3d.com</a>, you have the ability to buy a variety of licenses. To follow the whole book, you will at least need to purchase Unity Pro and <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>Android Pro licenses. Once they are purchased, you will receive an e-mail containing your new license key. Enter that in the provided text field.</p></li><li><p>If you are not ready to make a purchase, you have two alternatives. We will go over how to reset your license in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a simple application</em></span> section later in the chapter. The alternatives are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The first alternative is that you can check the <span class="strong"><strong>Activate the free version of Unity</strong></span> checkbox. This will allow you to use the free version of Unity. As discussed earlier, there are many reasons to choose this option. The most notable at the moment is cost.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Alternatively, you can select the <span class="strong"><strong>Activate a free 30-day trial of Unity Pro</strong></span> option. Unity offers a fully functional, one-time installation and a free 30-day trial of Unity Pro. This trial also includes the Android Pro add-on. Anything produced during the 30 days is completely yours, as if you had purchased a full Unity Pro license. They want you to see how great it is, so you will come back and make a purchase. The downside is that the <span class="strong"><strong>Trial Version</strong></span> watermark will be constantly displayed at the corner of the game. After the 30 days, Unity will revert to the free version. This is a great option, should you choose to wait before making a purchase.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Whatever<a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a> your choice is, hit <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> once you have made it.</p></li><li><p>The<a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a> next page simply asks you to log in with your Unity account. This will be the same account that you used to make your purchase. Just fill out the fields and hit <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>If you have not yet made a purchase, you can hit <span class="strong"><strong>Create Account</strong></span> and have it ready for when you do make a purchase.</p></li><li><p>The next page is a short survey on your development interests. Fill it out and hit <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> or scroll straight to the bottom and hit <span class="strong"><strong>Not right now</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Finally, there is a thank you page. Hit <span class="strong"><strong>Start using Unity</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>After a short initialization, the project wizard will open and we can start creating the next great game. However, there is still a bunch of work to do to connect the development device. So for now, hit the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> button in the top-right corner to close the project wizard. We will cover how to create a new project in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a simple application</em></span> section later on.</p></li></ol></div><p>We just completed installing Unity 3D. The whole book relies on this step. We also had to make a choice about licenses. If you chose to purchase the Pro version, you will be able to follow everything in this book without problems. The alternatives, though, will have a few shortcomings. You will either not have full access to all of the features or be limited to the length of the trial period while making due with a watermark in your games.</p></div></div>
