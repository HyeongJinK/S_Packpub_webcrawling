We started by understanding how Unity handles audio files. By adding background music and some squeak to the ball, we put into practice what we learned. We moved on to understand particle systems and created a dust trail for the ball. Finally, we put the two skill sets together and created explosions for the bananas when collected. Particle systems and audio effects add a lot to the final polish and look of a game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will complete our gaming experience together by taking a look at optimization in Unity. We will take a look at the tools provided for tracking performance. We will also create our own tool to track specific parts of a script's performance. We will explore asset compression and the other points that we can change to minimize the application footprint. Finally, key points for minimizing the lag while working with games and Unity will be discussed.</p></div>
