Probably, you are a gamer yourself and this concept should be fairly familiar to you. In our game, we will add collectable coins scattered in the level's pieces for the player to collect. I am not going to talk too much about what collectables are and why it is good to use them as I believe it is pretty obvious. Let's skip all that and make a simple plan:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Our collectables—let's call them coins from now on—will be collected on contact with the player game object</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will write the <code class="literal">Collectable</code> class to manage coin behavior</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>For every coin collected, we will count and increment the number of collected coins on the UI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The count of total collected coins will restart with the new game</p></li></ul></div></div>
