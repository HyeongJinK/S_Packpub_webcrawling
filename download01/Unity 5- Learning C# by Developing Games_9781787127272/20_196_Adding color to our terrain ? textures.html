Thankfully, it's very easy to add textures to everything. However, first, we need to have some textures to paint onto the world. For this instance, we will make use of some of the free assets that Unity <a id="id849" class="indexterm"></a>provides us with.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>So, with that mindset, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Environment.</strong></span>
</p></li><li><p>From there, uncheck all of the folders aside from the <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> one and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once imported, you<a id="id850" class="indexterm"></a> may see an error that <a id="id851" class="indexterm"></a>says <span class="strong"><strong>SpeedTree materials </strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>need to be regenerated</strong></span>. To check the error, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab to open it up.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_06.jpg" /></div><p>We aren't<a id="id853" class="indexterm"></a> actually using the trees yet, but I don't like seeing errors so let's fix them now.</p></li><li><p>To fix this, switch back to the<a id="id854" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and open up the <code class="literal">Standard Assets\Environment\SpeedTree</code> folder. Inside the<a id="id855" class="indexterm"></a> <code class="literal">Broadleaf</code> folder, you'll find two objects <code class="literal">Broadleaf_Desktop</code> and <code class="literal">Broadleaf_Mobile,</code> and from <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector,</strong></span> click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply &amp; Generate Materials</strong></span> button. After this, use the <code class="literal">Conifer_Desktop</code> and the <code class="literal">Palm_Desktop</code> and do the same. And with that our errors are gone!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_07.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Go to the<a id="id856" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and open up the <code class="literal">Standard Assets\Environment\TerrainAssets\SurfaceTexture</code> folder. From here, you'll see the<a id="id857" class="indexterm"></a> images that we are going to use to paint our terrain.</p></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> <a id="id858" class="indexterm"></a>object and then click on the fourth from the left button (that looks like a paint brush) to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Texture</strong></span> button. From here, you'll notice that it looks quite similar to the previous sections we've seen. However, now there is a <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span> section as well, but as of now, there is the information for <span class="strong"><strong>No terrain textures defined</strong></span>. So, let's fix that. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Textures</strong></span> button and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>You'll see an <a id="id859" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Add Terrain Texture</strong></span> dialogue popup. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> variable, place the <span class="strong"><strong>GrassHillAlbedo</strong></span> texture and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button.</p></li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_08.jpg" /></div><p>At this point, you<a id="id860" class="indexterm"></a> should see the entire world change to green<a id="id861" class="indexterm"></a> if you're far away.

Next, we will add cliffs around the edges where the water is. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To do this, add <a id="id863" class="indexterm"></a>an additional texture by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Textures...</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>. Select <span class="strong"><strong>CliffAlbedoSpecular</strong></span> as the texture and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>. Now if you select the terrain, you should see two textures. With the <span class="strong"><strong>CliffAlbedoSpecular</strong></span> texture selected, paint the edges of the water by clicking and holding the mouse, modifying the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> value as needed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_10.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We now want to<a id="id864" class="indexterm"></a> create a path for our player to follow, so we're going to create yet another texture this<a id="id865" class="indexterm"></a> time using the <span class="strong"><strong>SandAlbedo </strong></span>material. Since this is a path the player may take, I'm going to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> value to <span class="strong"><strong>8</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> value to <span class="strong"><strong>30</strong></span>, and use the second brush from the left, which is slightly less faded. Once finished, I'm going to paint in some trails that the player can follow. One thing that you will want to try to do is to make sure that the player shouldn't go too far before having to backtrack and reward the player for exploration. The following screenshot shows the path:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_11.jpg" /></div><p>Now, it's <a id="id866" class="indexterm"></a>starting to<a id="id867" class="indexterm"></a> look really nice, but if we play the game and look at the floor or in the distance you can see some receptiveness in the textures, especially from the flat floor.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_12.jpg" /></div><p>Thankfully, Unity has some things we can do in order to break up this monotony, namely that we can mix textures.</p></li><li><p>To reduce the appearance of texture duplication, we can introduce new materials with a<a id="id868" class="indexterm"></a> very soft opacity, which we place in patches in areas where there is just plain ground. For <a id="id869" class="indexterm"></a>example, let's create a new texture with the <span class="strong"><strong>GrassRockyAlbedo </strong></span>texture. Change the <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">16</code> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> value to something really low, such as <code class="literal">6</code>, and then start painting the areas that look too repetitive. Feel free to select the first brush again to have a smoother touch up.</p></li><li><p>Now, if we zoom into the world as if we were a character there, I can tell that the first grass texture is way too big for the environment, but we can actually change that very easily. <span class="emphasis"><em>Double-click</em></span> on the texture to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> value to (<code class="literal">8</code>,<code class="literal">8</code>). This will <a id="id870" class="indexterm"></a>make the texture smaller before it duplicates. It's a good idea to have different textures<a id="id871" class="indexterm"></a> with different sizes so that the seams of each texture aren't visible to others. The following screenshot shows the size options:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_13.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Do the same changes as in the preceding step for our sand texture as well, changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> option to <code class="literal">(8,8)</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_14.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>With this, we already<a id="id872" class="indexterm"></a> have a level that looks pretty nice! However, that being said, it's just some hills. To<a id="id873" class="indexterm"></a> really have a quality-looking title, we are going to need to do some additional work to beautify the environment.</p></div></div>
