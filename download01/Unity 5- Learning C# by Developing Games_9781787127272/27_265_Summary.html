We cannot blindly apply them to any given Scene and expect improvements. If our application and Scene happen to fit a particular set of parameters, then these methods are very effective at reducing CPU load and rendering bottlenecks. But, if not, then some additional work is required to prepare our Scene to match its feature requirements. Ultimately, only a good understanding of the batching systems and how they function can help us determine where and when this feature can be applied.</p><p>We will cover more graphics improvement techniques in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch30">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Graphics</em></span>. Until then, let's move onto a different topic, and look into some of the more subtle performance improvements that we can achieve through managing our art assets in intelligent ways.</p></div>
