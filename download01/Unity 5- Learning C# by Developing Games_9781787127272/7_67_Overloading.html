Overloading happens <a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a>when we have two methods with the same name but different signatures, that is, we are passing different types of parameters into the method.</p><p>As a constructor is a public method, the same rule applies. You can choose what overload you wish to use simply by entering the specific parameters when calling the method. MonoDevelop works well with Unity and helps you preview the available overloads you can use with its parameters and type.</p><p>Go back to the <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code> and have a try. Inside the <code class="literal">Start</code> function, type <code class="literal">new Person (</code>. The popup in MonoDevelop will appear as soon as you type the open bracket.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_11.jpg" /></div><p>MonoDevelop is trying to let us know there are two overloads available for <code class="literal">Person</code> constructors. Press down the arrow on your keyboard straightaway to preview the next overload:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_12.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, this is the custom constructor we have written. By pressing down the arrow key whenever you see this popup, you can iterate through all available overloads.</p><p>We know how to write <a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a>custom public constructors and how to call them. Let's try to put that knowledge into use now. I will use the same example again to make it easier to compare.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_13.jpg" /></div><p>Lines <span class="strong"><strong>14</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span> are calling our newly written custom constructor. As we are instantiating <code class="literal">Person</code> object and assigning <code class="literal">firstName</code> and <code class="literal">secondName</code> in one line, our code has shrunk by a few lines. This is <a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a>good! Less code but the same functionality.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"></a>Note</h3><p>Another good practice in programming is to keep your code as short as possible. If you are able to code same functionality in fewer lines, you should definitely do it, even if it requires rewriting part of your project.</p></div></div>
