<code class="literal">GameObjects</code> have some<a id="id98" class="indexterm"></a> components that make them behave in a certain way. For instance, select <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> and look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. One of the components is the camera. Without that component, it will cease being a camera. It would still be a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in your scene, just no longer a functioning camera.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"></a>Variables become component properties</h3></div></div></div><p>Any component of any<a id="id99" class="indexterm"></a> <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is just a script that defines a class, whether you wrote the script or the Unity's programmer did. We just aren't supposed to edit the scripts that Unity has written. This means that all the properties that we see in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> are just variables of some type. They simply store data that will be used by some method.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>Unity changes script and variable names slightly</h3></div></div></div><p>When we add our<a id="id100" class="indexterm"></a> script to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, the name of our script shows<a id="id101" class="indexterm"></a> up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel as a <code class="literal">Component</code>. Unity makes a couple of small changes. You might have noticed that when we added <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> to <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, Unity actually showed it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel as <span class="strong"><strong>Learning Script</strong></span>. Unity added a space to separate the words of the <a id="id102" class="indexterm"></a>name. Unity does this modification to variable<a id="id103" class="indexterm"></a> names too. Notice that the <code class="literal">number1</code> variable is shown as <span class="strong"><strong>Number 1</strong></span> and <code class="literal">number2</code> as <span class="strong"><strong>Number 2</strong></span>. Unity capitalizes the first letter as well. These changes improve readability in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
