<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec64"></a>Using methods with objects</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We learned that an <a id="id236" class="indexterm"></a>object is a container for data. We can store specific data <a id="id237" class="indexterm"></a>inside the objects in its variables, and we can also write some more useful methods. OOP is a very neat and flexible concept. There is nothing stopping us from using our encapsulated object and passing it as a parameter to the other method. Let's write the following code as an example where the class name is <code class="literal">Person</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_7.jpg" /></div><p>I removed most of the variables from the <code class="literal">Person</code> class to make this example clearer. If you are writing this <a id="id238" class="indexterm"></a>example in the same Unity Project as the previous <a id="id239" class="indexterm"></a>example, you will get some errors in the <code class="literal">Family</code> class we were using before. I recommend <a id="id240" class="indexterm"></a>starting this example in <a id="id241" class="indexterm"></a>a new Unity Project and the class here is <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_8.jpg" /></div><p>Yes, lots of new code to analyze, awesome! What we are trying to do here is create two instances of the <code class="literal">Person</code> object. We'll cross-reference them by assigning a public member spouse, and then call the method within the object class itself. Let's analyze this step by stepâ€”we do not want to get you confused.</p><p>Let's talk about the <code class="literal">Person</code> class first. You most certainly understand what an object is and we can hold variables in them. However, I want to talk about the <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method inside the class itself. As you can see, this is a <code class="literal">return</code> type method that returns a <code class="literal">bool</code> value and takes one parameter. Notice the type of the parameter. The <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method takes another instance of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class.</p><p>Line <span class="strong"><strong>13</strong></span> of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class checks whether there is any value stored in the spouse variable.</p><p>The easiest way to check if there is any value assigned to the variable is comparing the variable to <code class="literal">null</code>. If <a id="id242" class="indexterm"></a>the variable isn't null, it means there is something assigned to the variable.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">null</code> keyword is a literal that represents a null reference, one that does not refer to any object. It is the default value of reference-type variables.</p></div><p>So, if spouse isn't assigned, it means our instance isn't married and we are returning false in line <span class="strong"><strong>27</strong></span>. Let's talk about the <code class="literal">LearningObjects</code> class. It must be pretty obvious to you what is going on there. We are creating two instances of the <code class="literal">Person</code> class and assigning the values. Notice lines <span class="strong"><strong>22</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>23</strong></span>. We are assigning <code class="literal">woman.spouse</code> with a <code class="literal">man</code> object and <code class="literal">man.spouse</code> with a <code class="literal">woman</code> object. I asked you to do it this way to demonstrate that you can easily reference objects inside other objects even if both of them are the same type.</p><p>Line <span class="strong"><strong>26</strong></span> is where the main logic happens. We are calling the <code class="literal">IsMarriedWith</code> method on the <code class="literal">man</code> instance and passing <code class="literal">woman</code> object. Yet again, this is to demonstrate how flexible objects are. The condition in line <span class="strong"><strong>26</strong></span> will be true if two <code class="literal">Person</code> type objects are married. If so, the suitable message is printed out in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel.</p><p>Go ahead and play with the code. Try to add some more methods or variables to the <code class="literal">Person</code> class. Why not add an <code class="literal">age</code> public member again and write a method to return the total number of years? Sky is the limit! The best you can do is write a lot of code. Learning by experience is <a id="id243" class="indexterm"></a>the fastest way to become a decent programmer. Fingers crossed!</p></div>
