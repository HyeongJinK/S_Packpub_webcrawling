This is great when you're experimenting and want to see the results.</p><p>Write down any changes that you want to keep because when you stop the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode, any changes you made will be lost.</p><p>When you are in the development mode, changes that you make to the property values will be saved by Unity. This means that if you quit Unity and start it again, the changes will be retained. Of course, you won't see the effect of your changes until you click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>.</p><p>The changes that you make to the property values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel do not modify your script. The only way your script can be changed is by you editing it in the script editor (MonoDevelop). The values shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel override any values you might have assigned in your script.</p><p>If you wish to undo the changes you've made in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, you can reset the values to the default values assigned in your script. Click on the cog icon (the gear) on the far right of the component script, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_03_01.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"></a>Displaying public variables in the Inspector panel</h3></div></div></div><p>You might still be<a id="id105" class="indexterm"></a> wondering what the word <code class="literal">public</code> at the beginning of a variable statement means:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public int number1 = 2;</pre></div><p>We mentioned it <a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a>before. It means that the variable will be visible and accessible. It will be visible as a property in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel so that you can manipulate the value stored in the variable. The word also means that it can be accessed from other scripts using the dot syntax.</p></div></div>
