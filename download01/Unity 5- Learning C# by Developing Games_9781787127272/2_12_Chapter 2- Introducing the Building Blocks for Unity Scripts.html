These parts are variables and methods. Therefore, understanding these critical parts is very necessary for learning any of the other features of C#. As critical as they are, they are very simple concepts to understand. Using these variable and method foundation pieces, we'll introduce the C# building blocks that are used to create Unity scripts.</p><p>For those who get sweaty palms by just thinking of the word script, wipe your hands and relax! In this chapter, I'm going to use terms that are already familiar to you to introduce the building blocks of programming. The following are the concepts introduced in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using variables and methods in scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The class, which is a container for variables and methods</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Turning a script into a component</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Components that communicate using the dot syntax</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Making decisions in code</p></li></ul></div></div>
