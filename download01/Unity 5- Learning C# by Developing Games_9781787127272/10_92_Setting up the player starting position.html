We already mentioned that resetting the starting position of the <a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> game object would be a good start. Positions in the 3D world in Unity are described using <code class="literal">Vector3 struct</code>. Go ahead and type <code class="literal">Vector3</code> in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Reference</em></span> for a better understanding. This is complex stuff, so don't worry if you can't get it. All you need to know now is that <code class="literal">Vector3</code> is made up of three floats describing <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> positions in the space.</p><p>Let's go forward and perform some code changes to set up the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> position. In <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>, we will:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Add private <code class="literal">Vector3</code> type variable and call it <code class="literal">startingPosition</code> in <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>.</p></li><li><p>Assign the <code class="literal">startingPosition</code> value taken from the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> game object world space position in the <code class="literal">Awake</code> method. This way, we will always store the initial position of the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> game object just after Unity starts executing the game.</p></li><li><p>Rename the <code class="literal">Start</code> method to <code class="literal">StartGame</code>, as we will call it from the <code class="literal">GameManager</code> from now.</p></li><li><p>Set the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> position to starting position in the <code class="literal">StartGame</code> method.</p></li></ol></div><p>You are feeling a bit confused now? We have carried out a lot of changes in one go. If you really feel lost now, here's what the first part of <code class="literal">PlayerController</code> should look like (hopefully it will make you less anxious):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_10_10.jpg" /></div><p>Now, inside the <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">GameManager StartGame</code> <a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a>method, make sure you are calling:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">PlayerController.instance.StartGame();</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_10_11.jpg" /></div><p>Time for testing. Save both scripts and come back to Unity. If you are getting any compiler errors, please go back and double-check everything. If you don't have any errors, that's great! Go ahead and press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in Unity. Every time you hit the <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> button on the keyboard, the <a id="id338" class="indexterm"></a>game will restart and the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> game <a id="id339" class="indexterm"></a>object's position will be set back to its initial position.</p></div>
