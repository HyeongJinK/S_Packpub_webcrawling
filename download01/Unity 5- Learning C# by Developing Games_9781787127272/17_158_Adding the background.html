If not, change it and then press the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button.</p><p>At this point, I<a id="id639" class="indexterm"></a> want to point out the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixels Per Unit</strong></span> property as it is important for our logic in the code we'll write later. By default, it is set to <code class="literal">100</code>, so the background image (which is <span class="strong"><strong>800 x 480</strong></span>) will be 8 x 4.8 units in the Unity scene. This works out nicely for this case because we will mostly be using the width, but for traditional sprites that come in powers of 2 values (such as <span class="strong"><strong>64 x 64</strong></span>), you may wish to change this value to the width or height value to make the image easier to work with.</p></li><li><p>Bring the background sprite into the world by dragging and dropping it into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene </strong></span>tab. Then, with the object selected, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab, right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Position</strong></span>.</p><p>We now have our background centered in the world, but you'll notice that if we play the game we see this blue background around our image, which is fairly unappealing:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>When dealing with mobile games, you want to have your project support many different resolutions and <a id="id640" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>aspect ratios</strong></span>, so we will zoom our camera in so that if we're using many of the common aspect ratios seen for games it'll look correct for us.</p></li><li><p>From<a id="id641" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, select the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code> object. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> component and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> property to <code class="literal">2.2</code>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> property (known as the <code class="literal">orthographicSize</code> property in code) is half of the vertical size of the camera. Our background image is 480 pixels tall so setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> property to 2.4 would make the camera fit vertically exactly with the image. However, setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> property to 2.2 zooms us so that we have some leeway for working in different resolutions on the width side of things.</p></li><li><p>Now <a id="id642" class="indexterm"></a>select the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab to see what the game looks like. Right under the tab, you'll see a dropdown beside <span class="strong"><strong>Display 1</strong></span> that says what aspect ratio the game is currently testing for. Select it and go through each of them. Note that the background image will now cover the entire project. To make it easier to see, I'll be going to <span class="strong"><strong>16:9</strong></span> for the rest of the project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_04_02.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>You can also press the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> button and create your own custom resolutions to support such as the 1920x1080 of iPhone 6s Plus or qHD and wqHD of some more recent Android devices.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note70"></a>Note</h3><p>For a very detailed solution towards the thinking of supporting multiple resolutions, though this is in a different game engine, it does a good job explaining the thought process for it.
