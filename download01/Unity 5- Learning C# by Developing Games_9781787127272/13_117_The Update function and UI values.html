As you must have noticed, we are updating all UI values in the <code class="literal">Update</code> function. As the <code class="literal">Update</code> function is called on every frame, we are wasting a lot of computation power there. This isn't the most efficient <a id="id429" class="indexterm"></a>or correct way of assigning these values for every frame. Ideally, we change the text value only when we need to; for example, when the value actually changes. I decided to show you this way because it's definitely the simplest way. As this book is written for you, a beginner in programming, this way just works.</p></div>
