This can <a id="id874" class="indexterm"></a>be a useful tool as a level designer to designate places that players can't go to if you can't swim. Thankfully, it's also quite easy to add to our level, and due to it being included with Unity, we won't need to go to the Asset Store to get it.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, go into the <code class="literal">Standard Assets/Environment/Water/Water/Prefabs</code> folder to then drag and drop the <code class="literal">WaterProNighttime</code> prefab into the scene.</p></li><li><p>Once in the scene, change the object's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to <code class="literal">250, 90, 250</code> and give it a <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> of <code class="literal">250, 1, 250</code> so it covers the entire area.
