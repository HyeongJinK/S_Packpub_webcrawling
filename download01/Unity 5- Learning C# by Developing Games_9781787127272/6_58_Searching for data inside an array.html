It's very straightforward <a id="id217" class="indexterm"></a>as long as you know the specific index your element is stored under. If you don't, you can search for it by iterating through the entire array object.</p><p>Yet again, let's go back to the <code class="literal">familyMembers</code> example and try to look for the index of the <code class="literal">"Adam"</code> string value:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_06_10.jpg" /></div><p>We are<a id="id218" class="indexterm"></a> not going<a id="id219" class="indexterm"></a> too much into the details. The easiest way of finding the index of a certain element in the collection is by looping through the array and comparing elements. You can spot that on line <span class="strong"><strong>22</strong></span>. If the <code class="literal">familyMembers[i] == "Adam"</code> condition is true, line <span class="strong"><strong>23</strong></span> will be executed. The <code class="literal">adamsIndex</code> variable will be then assigned the current <code class="literal">i</code> value.</p><p>Notice the default<a id="id220" class="indexterm"></a> value of <code class="literal">adamsIndex</code>. I deliberately assigned it <code class="literal">-1</code> so that we can check on line <span class="strong"><strong>29</strong></span> whether there were any changes to this value inside the loop. If it's still <code class="literal">-1</code>, it means that the value we are trying to find inside the array was not found<a id="id221" class="indexterm"></a> at all.</p></div>
