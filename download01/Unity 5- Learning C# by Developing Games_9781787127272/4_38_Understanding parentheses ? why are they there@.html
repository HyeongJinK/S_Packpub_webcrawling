That's one of the reasons a method is created in the first place—so that we don't have to write the same code over and over. Remember the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers()</code> example method? We have mentioned that a method can take some input parameters. Why is this useful?</p><p>A script may need to add two numbers several times, but they probably won't always be the same two numbers. We can have possibly hundreds of different combinations of <span class="emphasis"><em>two numbers</em></span> to add together. This means that we need to let the method know which two numbers need to be added together at the moment when we call the method. Let's write a code example to make sure you fully understand it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_04_02.jpg" /></div><p>Lines <span class="strong"><strong>7</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>8</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>9</strong></span> should be quite clear to you—simple declarations of variables.</p><p>Let's take<a id="id137" class="indexterm"></a> a look at the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method. It's a <code class="literal">void</code> function. Again, this means the function does something but does not return any data. Inside the parentheses, our method takes two variables: <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code>.</p><p>Line <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span> contains the declaration and assignment of the local variable that we will be printing on line <span class="strong"><strong>26</strong></span>.</p><p>So, <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> is written the universal way. We can reuse this function as many times as we want, passing different parameters.</p><p>Lines <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>16</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>17</strong></span> call our function three times, each time passing different parameters to the function. Let's<a id="id138" class="indexterm"></a> test whether it works! Go ahead, add the <code class="literal">LearningReusableMethods</code> component to any <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the Unity scene, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>.</p><p>As this script executes, the <code class="literal">AddAndPrintTwoNumbers</code> method is called three times on lines <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>16</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>17</strong></span>. The method's code block adds two numbers and displays the result in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_04_03.jpg" /></div><p>As expected! The console will print out the values. There's a special name for information<a id="id139" class="indexterm"></a> between the parentheses of a method definition, such as line <span class="strong"><strong>23</strong></span>—the code is called <span class="strong"><strong>method parameters</strong></span>.</p></div>
