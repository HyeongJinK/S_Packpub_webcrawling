This book is for those with absolutely no knowledge of programming. It is devoted to teaching the basics of C# with Unity.</p><p>However, some knowledge of Unity's operation is required. I will only be covering the parts of the Unity interface that are related to writing C# code. I am assuming that you know your way around Unity's interface.
