Since variable names can be only one word, begin the first word with a lowercase and then just capitalize the first letter of every additional word. This greatly helps create descriptive names which the viewer is still able to read. There's a term for this, called camel casing.</p><p>I have already mentioned that for public variables, Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> will separate each word and capitalize the first word. Go ahead! Add the previous statement to <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> and see what Unity does with it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</p></div>
