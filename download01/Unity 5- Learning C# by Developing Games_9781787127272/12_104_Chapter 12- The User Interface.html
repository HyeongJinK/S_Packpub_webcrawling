We will construct and implement a simple, dynamic user interface using Unity's built-in UI system.</p><p>In this chapter, we will <a id="id375" class="indexterm"></a>cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Introducting the Unity UI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating UI Views</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Connecting buttons to actions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Switching UI views</p></li></ul></div><p>So far, our sole focus was on learning how to code. I would like to make a little exception in this chapter and talk about coding the UI functionality as well as creating a good-looking UI. You probably already know what a user interface is, right? If not, we will cover it very briefly.</p><p>A UI is a bridge between a human and a computer program. All user interactions with your game will be happening in the user interface. In simple words, all buttons on the screen, labels, as well as mouse- and keyboard-driven events are part of the UI.</p><p>The main part of the UI <a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a>is the <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>). The GUI is simply whatever is visible on the screen. All graphical elements that the user can interact with to control the game constitute the GUI:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_12_01.jpg" /></div><p>This is an example of a very simple <a id="id377" class="indexterm"></a>GUI panel that allows the user to choose what to do. It contains four simple buttons. They are easy for the user to interact with. We will also create a simple and easy-to-operate UI for our game.</p></div>
