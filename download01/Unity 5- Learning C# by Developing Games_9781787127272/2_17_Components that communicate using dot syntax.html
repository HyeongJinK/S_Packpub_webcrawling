I now want to introduce the concept of communicating with other <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> and the components they contain. Communication between one components <code class="literal">GameObject</code> and another component <code class="literal">GameObject</code> using dot syntax is a vital part of scripting. It's what makes interaction possible. We need to communicate with other components or <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> to be able to use the variables and methods in other components.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>What's with the dots?</h3></div></div></div><p>When <a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a>you look at code written by others, you'll see words with periods separating them. What the heck is that? It looks complicated, doesn't it. The following is an example from the Unity documentation:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">transform.position.x</pre></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>Don't concern yourself with what the preceding code means, as that comes later. I just want you to see the dots.</p></div><p>This is called dot syntax. The following is another example. It's the fictitious address of my house: UnitedKingdom, Bedfordshire, Sandy, 10MyStreet. Looks funny, doesn't it? That's because I used the syntax (grammar) of C# instead of the post office. However, I'll bet that, if you look closely, you can easily figure out how to find my house. We'll get into much more at a later stage. For now, think of dot syntax as an address, starting from a big thing, a country in this case, and narrowing down to the most precise part that we want to access.</p></div></div>
