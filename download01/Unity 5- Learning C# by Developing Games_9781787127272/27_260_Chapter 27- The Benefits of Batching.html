The goal of this process is to reduce computation time, often by exploiting parallel processing or reducing overhead costs, if the entire batch is treated as individual elements. In some cases, the act of batching centers around meshes, large sets of vertices, edges, UV coordinates, and so on, which are used to represent a 3D object. However, the term could just as easily refer to the act of batching audio files, sprites, and texture files (also known as <a id="id1334" class="indexterm"></a>Atlasing), and other large datasets.</p><p>So, just to clear up any confusion, when the topic of batching is mentioned in Unity, it is usually referring to the two primary <a id="id1335" class="indexterm"></a>mechanisms it offers for batching mesh files: Static and <a id="id1336" class="indexterm"></a>Dynamic Batching. These methods are essentially a form <a id="id1337" class="indexterm"></a>of geometry instancing, where we <a id="id1338" class="indexterm"></a>use the same mesh data in memory to repeatedly render the same object multiple times without needing to prepare the data more than once.</p><p>These batching features offer us opportunities to improve the performance of our application, but only as long as they are used wisely. They are fairly nuanced systems, and there has been a lot of confusion surrounding the conditions that they are triggered under, and just as importantly, under what conditions we would even see a performance improvement. In some cases, batching can actually degrade performance if batches are asked to process datasets under conditions that don't fit a very particular mold.</p><p>The batching systems in<a id="id1339" class="indexterm"></a> Unity are mostly a black box, in which Unity technologies have not revealed much detailed, technical information about their inner workings. But, based on their behavior, profiler data, and the list of requirements needed to make them work, we can still infer a great deal. This chapter intends to dispel much of the misinformation floating around about batching systems. We will observe, via explanation, exploration, and examples, just how these two batching methods operate. This will enable us to make informed decisions, making the most of them to improve our application's performance.</p></div>
