Let's learn how to do that while also learning more about how Unity's UI system works:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Just like we did in the previous chapter, we will first create a text object with the name of our game, so with that in mind go to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject | UI | Text</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>Just like before, this <a id="id531" class="indexterm"></a>will create three objects, which we'll talk about in more detail now:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> – This is the area where all of the UI elements will reside and if you try to create a UI element without one, Unity will create one for <a id="id532" class="indexterm"></a>you like it did here. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span> view, it will draw a white rectangle around itself to show you how large it is. The game object contains a <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> component which allows you to dictate how the image will be rendered, as well as <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> to make your art scale depending on the resolution of the device the game is running on and <span class="strong"><strong>Graphic Raycaster</strong></span> which determines whether any objects on the Canvas have been hit.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note54"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on the Canvas object, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UICanvas.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UICanvas.html</a>.</p></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> – This object is <a id="id533" class="indexterm"></a>our actual text object and has all of the properties to allow us to position the object anywhere on the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> and change what text, color, size, and more will be displayed.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>EventSystem</strong></span> – This object allows users to send events to objects in our game based<a id="id534" class="indexterm"></a> on various input types, from keyboard to touch events to gamepads. There are properties here that allow you to specify how you'd like users to interface with your UI and if you try to create a UI element without one, Unity will create one for you like it did here.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note55"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information<a id="id535" class="indexterm"></a> on <code class="literal">EventSystem</code>, check out: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EventSystem.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EventSystem.html</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>To make it easier to<a id="id536" class="indexterm"></a> see our text object, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab and double-click on the <code class="literal">Text</code> object. It may be a little difficult to see, so from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab scroll down to the <span class="strong"><strong>Text </strong></span>component and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> property to white.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_03.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note56"></a>Note</h3><p>If you cannot see the text after this, confirm that the <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> value for the color is <code class="literal">255</code> (with colors, A is the alpha channel in which 0 means fully transparent and 1 is fairly opaque).</p></div></li><li><p>The next thing we are going to do is make it easier to tell what this object is, so with that in mind scroll all the way up on the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab with the <code class="literal">Text </code>object selected and change its name to <code class="literal">Game Title</code>.</p><p>After this, we are going to want to move this object to its proper place in the world; however, just like in the last chapter, you'll note that instead of the default <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component we've been seeing our text object has a <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component in the same place. The <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component is probably the most different thing about working in the<a id="id537" class="indexterm"></a> UI system, so it's a good idea to learn as much as we can about it.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> is different from regular <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> in the sense that whereas <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> represents a single point or the center of an object, <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> represents a rectangle that the UI element will reside in. If an object with <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> has a parent that also has <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>, the child will specify how the object should be positioned relative to the parent.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information<a id="id538" class="indexterm"></a> on positioning objects and <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIBasicLayout.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIBasicLayout.html</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Now, to get a better idea of what the properties of the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component mean, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> values to <code class="literal">0</code>, which will center our object around the object's anchors.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_04.jpg" /></div><p>Our object's anchors are visible from the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab via the four small rectangles <a id="id539" class="indexterm"></a>creating the X shape in the center of our <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab if you have the <span class="strong"><strong>Game Title</strong></span> object selected. (Double-click on it to center the object on the screen.)</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note58"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that the white box that is displayed above for the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> may look different on your screen based on the <span class="strong"><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></span> you've set from the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab (mine is set to <span class="strong"><strong>Free Aspect</strong></span> so it scales based off of that).</p></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> give you the ability to "hold on" to a corner or part of the canvas so that if the <a id="id540" class="indexterm"></a>canvas were to move and/or change, the pieces of UI will stay in an appropriate place. This can be quite useful when it comes to things like supporting multiple resolutions without scaling the art assets created. In our case, we will want to have our title position itself relative to the top of the level.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor Presets</strong></span> menu in the upper-left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component. From there, it shows some of the most common anchor positions that are used in games for easy selection. In our case, we will want to pick the top-center option.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_05.jpg" /></div><p>Notice that now the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> value has become <code class="literal">-93</code>. This is saying that our object is <a id="id541" class="indexterm"></a>positioned 93 units below the anchor's y position. If we change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> value to <code class="literal">0</code>, the object would be centered along the y axis' anchor, which would put the object half off the screen, which is not good. </p><p>However, if we changed our <code class="literal">Game Title</code> object's <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">-15</code> (subtracting half its <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> value), it would be positioned correctly; however, if we decided we wanted to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> later on, we would have to remember to adjust this as well. It would be a lot nicer if we had something to make <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> at <code class="literal">0</code> be the edge of the map relative to our height and thankfully we have the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span> property to fix that.</p></li><li><p>Next, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot Y</strong></span> property to <code class="literal">1</code> and then change <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code>. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_06.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pivots</strong></span> are markers that inform<a id="id542" class="indexterm"></a> the other values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component saying where we want to <a id="id543" class="indexterm"></a>affect things, relative to this position on our object. This means that objects will be moved, rotated, and/or scaled via this position. To note how things react and what changing the values does, try changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation Z</strong></span> property with <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot Y</strong></span> of <code class="literal">0, 0.5</code>, and <code class="literal">1</code> and see the differences in how things are rotated.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note59"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that it is possible to set the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot, Position</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Anchors</strong></span> of an object via the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchors Preset</strong></span> menu I mentioned previously if you hold down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt </em></span>and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> keys while clicking on the desired spot. This way, all of the steps we discussed will happen all at once, but it's a good idea to get an understanding of what everything means before jumping straight into using the shortcuts.</p></div></li><li><p>Now that we have our object positioned correctly, let's give it some visual flair. Select the <code class="literal">Game Title</code> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab and then move over to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab and scroll down to the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component. From there, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span>
<a id="id544" class="indexterm"></a> property to <code class="literal">Twinstick Shooter</code> and change <span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span> of the object to the center vertically and horizontally. Afterward, change <span class="strong"><strong>Font</strong></span> to the <code class="literal">OSP-DIN</code> we used in the last chapter and then change <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> to <code class="literal">35</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> to white. Notice that now the text doesn't show up, because we've made the text too big for the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> that we defined.</p></li><li><p>With that in mind, scroll up to <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> and change <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> to <code class="literal">200</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> to <code class="literal">50</code>. We will also want it to be offset from the top of the world, so let's change <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">-30</code> to give it a little offset.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>Now, this looks great for this resolution, but if we were to play the game at a higher resolution, it may look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_08.jpg" /></div><p>This can be good if you're trying to do a HUD in your game, but for the title screen it's usually a good idea to make things large, so with that in mind we will use the<a id="id545" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> component to adjust the size of the objects automatically.</p></li><li><p>Select the <code class="literal">Canvas </code>object <a id="id546" class="indexterm"></a>from <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and then in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> from <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> change <span class="strong"><strong>Ui Scale Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Scale with Screen Size</strong></span>. From there, change <span class="strong"><strong>Reference Resolution</strong></span> to <code class="literal">800 x 600</code> if it isn't there already.</p></li><li><p>Next, let's make the text a bit larger. With that in mind, from <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform </strong></span>change <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> to <code class="literal">400</code> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> to <code class="literal">100</code> and then change the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Font Size</strong></span> to <code class="literal">70</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_09.jpg" /></div><p>Now, if we play<a id="id547" class="indexterm"></a> the game from a higher resolution, it will display our title nicely:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_02_10.jpg" /></div><p>As we can see, it's <a id="id548" class="indexterm"></a>working great!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note60"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on<a id="id549" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span>, check out: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-CanvasScaler.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-CanvasScaler.html</a>.</p></div></li></ol></div></div>
