All it means is that the method has to be able to use the information you send it, so you simply have to specify the type of data that the method is allowed to use. That's it! It's very simple.</p><p>In the earlier screenshot, on line <span class="strong"><strong>23</strong></span>, we declared the <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code> variables. The type is <code class="literal">int</code>. Now notice our member variables: <code class="literal">number1</code>, <code class="literal">number2</code>, and <code class="literal">number3</code>. They are also of the <code class="literal">int</code> type. These variables have to be of the <code class="literal">int</code> type since they store the numbers that will be added in the method, which the parameters specify will be of <code class="literal">int</code> the type.</p><p>So now, go<a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a> look in the dictionary again. You will probably see the word limit in there somewhere. That's what you did when you specified the type of data that the method will use, an integer in this case. You set some limits on what is allowed.</p><p>Okay, so you're setting parameters, or limits, on the type of data the method can use, but what exactly is a parameter? Well, the first parameter is called <code class="literal">firstNumber</code>. And what is <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> doing? It stores a value that will be used in the code block on line <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span>. What do we call things that store data? That's right, variables! Variables are used everywhere.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note23"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember that a variable is just a substitute name for the value it actually stores.</p></div><p>As you can see on line <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span> of the code block, those variables are being added and stored in the <code class="literal">result</code> variable.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec39"></a>How many parameters can a method have?</h3></div></div></div><p>We can <a id="id142" class="indexterm"></a>have as many parameters as we need to make a method work properly. Whether we write our own custom methods or use the methods of the scripting reference, the parameters that are defined are what the method will require to be able to perform its specified task.</p></div></div>
