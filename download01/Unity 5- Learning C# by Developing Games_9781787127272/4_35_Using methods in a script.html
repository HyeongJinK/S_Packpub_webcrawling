</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To create reusable sections of code</p></li></ul></div><p>All of the executable code in a script is inside methods. The first purpose of a method is to work with the member variables of the class. The member variables store data that is needed for a component to give a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> its behavior. The whole reason for writing a script is to make a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> do something interesting. A method is the place where we make a behavior come to life.</p><p>The second purpose of a method is to create code blocks that will be used over and over again. You<a id="id126" class="indexterm"></a> don't want to be writing the same code over and over. Instead, you <a id="id127" class="indexterm"></a>place the code in a code block and give it a name so that you can call it whenever needed.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at this example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>This is a perfect example of the function that does something useful. It might look a bit strange to you as it takes two parameters. Don't worry about it too much as of now; we will cover it in detail soon. All I want you to notice right now is that the preceding method can take some data and do something useful with it. In this case, it is adding two numbers and printing the result on the Unity console. Now, the best part nowâ€”we can call this method as many times as we want, passing different parameters, without repeating the code every time we need it. If you feel confused, don't worry. Just remember that a function can save you from repeating code over and over again.</p><p>Methods can also return some data. We will cover this at a later stage in this chapter.</p></div>
