Our game should have a target audience in mind, who can tell us the hardware limitations our game might be under. We can perform runtime testing of our application, gather data from multiple components (CPU, GPU, memory, physics, rendering, and so on), and compare them against the desired metrics. We can use this data to identify bottlenecks in our application, perform additional instrumentation to determine the root cause of the issue, and approach the problem from a variety of angles.</p><p>To give us the tools and knowledge to complete this process, this chapter will introduce a variety of methods that we will use throughout the book to determine whether we have a performance problem, and where the root cause of the performance issue can be found. These skills will give us the techniques we need to detect, analyze, and prove that performance issues are plaguing our <a id="id1158" class="indexterm"></a>

In doing so, you will prepare yourselves for the remaining chapters where you will learn what can be done about the problems you're facing.</p><p>We will begin with an exploration of the <a id="id1159" class="indexterm"></a>
