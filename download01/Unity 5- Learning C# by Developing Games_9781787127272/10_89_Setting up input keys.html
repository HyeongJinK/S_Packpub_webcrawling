To do that, follow these simple steps.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open <span class="strong"><strong>InputManager</strong></span> by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>ProjectSettings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Input</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Increase input size of <span class="strong"><strong>Axis</strong></span> by 1.</p></li><li><p>Select the bottom <span class="strong"><strong>Axis</strong></span> and change its settings.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_10_5.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>We have a new input button <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>set up as well as the code executed each time the button is pressed. Time to test that. Press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in Unity and, after Jake drops on the platform, press <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> on the keyboard. The <code class="literal">StartGame()</code> method will be called by Unity just after you pressed the key. The <code class="literal">StartGame()</code> method changes <code class="literal">currentGameState</code> to <code class="literal">inGame</code> so our gameplay starts.</p><p>So, we completed the first part of the simple <code class="literal">gameplay</code> loop. The user can start the game by pressing the button and the game will start. As we are calling it a loop, it will have to be a closed chain of events. To close the gameplay, we will need to add the <code class="literal">GameOver</code> event.</p><p>In our simple game, the game over event will be called when the player dies. There will be two ways to kill the player:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>By falling through the hole in the ground</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>By hitting obstacles</p></li></ul></div><p>We already have the physics functionality working, which means Jake is falling through the holes. All we need to do is create some sort of trigger telling <code class="literal">GameManager</code>, "Player fallen through the hole, game over!"</p></div>
