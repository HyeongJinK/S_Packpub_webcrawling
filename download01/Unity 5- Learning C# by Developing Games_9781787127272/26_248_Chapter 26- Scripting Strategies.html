Scripting is a very broad term, so we will try to limit our exposure in this chapter to situations that are very Unity specific, focusing on problems arising from within the Unity APIs and engine design. We will discuss the nuances and advanced topics of the C# language, .NET library, and Mono Framework, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch31">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Masterful Memory Management</em></span>.</p><p>Whether you have some specific problems in mind that you wish to solve or you just want to learn some techniques for future reference, this chapter will introduce you to an array of methods that you can use to improve your scripting efforts now and in the future. In each case, we will explore how and why the performance issue arises, an example situation in which the problem is occurring, and one or more solutions to combat the issue.</p></div>
