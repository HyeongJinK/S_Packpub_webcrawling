You survived reading your first programming book! We can easily say that you are not suffering from <span class="emphasis"><em>scriptphobia</em></span> anymore. You have now learned how to write, read, and, most importantly, understand C# code in Unity. The next step for you is very easyâ€”decide what you want to do with your skills! I encourage you to keep working on the game we have started together, or you can start a new one from scratch! The sky is the limit!</p><p>Remember, however, that you will gradually gain experience. It would be wise to keep your projects simple and work on them from start to finish. There is nothing better for a game developer than finishing their very own project and publishing it!</p><p>Two very good places to show off your games are the Unity forums and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity Developers Facebook</em></span> public group. We would love you to join our community. Yet again, well done! Keep working hard and you will find your very own path to greatness.</p></div>
