The two images there are what we are going to use, but right now, their edges are all green. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, check the <span class="strong"><strong>Alpha Is Transparency</strong></span> option and then hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_19.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab and select out the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> object. The mode to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Plant Trees</strong></span> mode is <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Details mode</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on it and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Details…</strong></span> button and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Grass Texture</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select either of the <code class="literal">Grass</code> textures that we just changed for the <span class="strong"><strong>Detail Texture</strong></span>. After this, set <span class="strong"><strong>Healthy Color</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Dry Color</strong></span> by using the eyedropper and<a id="id882" class="indexterm"></a> choosing a color similar to our textures. Once you're done modifying the settings, then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_20.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Once created, paint the grass into the world in the same way we did textures. If you can't see it being placed, zoom in as you need to be close to see it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_21.jpg" /></div><p>Finally, our current island is very flat and while that's okay for cities, nature is<a id="id883" class="indexterm"></a> random. Go back into the <span class="strong"><strong>Height Raise/Lower</strong></span> tool and gently raise and lower some areas of the level to give the illusion of depth. Do note that your trees and grass will raise and fall with the changes that you make.</p></li><li><p>Once you're finished, save your level and play the game!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B05212_07_22.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note95"></a>Note</h3><p>This aspect of level <a id="id884" class="indexterm"></a>creation isn't very difficult, just time consuming. However, it's taking the time to put in these details that really sets a game apart from other titles. In general, you'll want to playtest and make sure that your level is fun before doing these actions; but I feel it's important to have an idea of how to do it for your future projects.</p></div></div>
