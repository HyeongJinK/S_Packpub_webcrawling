One of the best and my favorite is <span class="strong"><strong>NGUI</strong></span>. I have used it for many years without any major issues. In fact, NGUI was so good that <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity Technologies</em></span> decided to hire its developer to create a new UI system for Unity 4.6. Currently, the Unity UI system is the best choice. It is also built-in and does not require any Asset store purchases. Let's learn how to use it.</p><p>Good to mention here is that Unity UI is a tiny part of the Unity source code that is actually open source. What does this mean? It means you can download and edit Unity UI code to fit your purpose. I understand that your coding skills are not up to that level yet, but I thought it is worth mentioning for future reference.</p><p>If you ever decide to <a id="id379" class="indexterm"></a>play around with the UI source code, here is the link: <a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui</a>.</p></div>
