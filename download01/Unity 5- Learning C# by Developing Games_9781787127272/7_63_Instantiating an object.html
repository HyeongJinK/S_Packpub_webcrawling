<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec62"></a>Instantiating an object</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We know exactly <a id="id230" class="indexterm"></a>how to write a class as an object. The next step would be creating an instance of the object of that class. In C#, we use the keyword <code class="literal">new</code> to instantiate the object.</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">new ObjectType();</pre></div><p>So, we are using the keyword <code class="literal">new</code> followed by an ObjectType, and then we have the opening and closing brackets. <code class="literal">ObjectType</code> is nothing but your class name (we discussed this before).</p><p>Each time you instantiate an object of any class, Unity will create some space in the memory to store that object. The issue in the preceding syntax is that we are not assigning that freshly created object anywhere. Therefore, we won't be able to access its data.</p><p>The best way is to <a id="id231" class="indexterm"></a>assign this object to some variable:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">ObjectType myObjectInstance = new ObjectType();</pre></div><p>This way, we can access and change any variables inside our <code class="literal">myObjectInstance</code> object using the dot syntax. Again, let's learn from examples, OOP might seem a bit confusing at the start, but I promise you will master it when you go through the whole book.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_5.jpg" /></div><p>Please write the preceding code. We are using the <code class="literal">Person</code> class we spoke about a bit earlier; make sure you have <a id="id232" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Person</code> class in your project too. In lines <span class="strong"><strong>7</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>9</strong></span>, we are declaring a public member variables of the type <code class="literal">Person</code>.</p><p>In line <span class="strong"><strong>14</strong></span>, we are instantiating a new object of type <code class="literal">Person</code> and assigning it to public member named <code class="literal">father</code>. In lines <span class="strong"><strong>15</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>19</strong></span>, we are assigning various data to <code class="literal">father</code> variable. Please notice the syntax. To access the variables inside our object, we write the name of the instance variable followed by the dot and the name of the public variable. You can only access public variables and methods this way. Private variables are not accessible from the other classes. By the same analogy, we have instantiated and assigned mother and son objects.</p><p>In line <span class="strong"><strong>39</strong></span>, we are printing a quick message composed from the data stored inside <code class="literal">father</code>, <code class="literal">mother</code>, and <code class="literal">son</code> <a id="id233" class="indexterm"></a>objects. Press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in Unity and your <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> output should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_07_6.jpg" /></div><p>Go ahead and experiment with the codeâ€”change it, play with it!</p></div>
