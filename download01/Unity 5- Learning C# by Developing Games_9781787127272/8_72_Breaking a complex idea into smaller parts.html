Some are simple, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Tic-tac-toe</em></span>, and some of them require years of hard work from teams and tons of planning to develop. There is a one common factor, however. Absolutely every idea can be broken down into smaller parts—parts that can be more manageable and easier to approach. Let's put our generic talk aside now and focus on our game.</p><p>We have a very rough idea of what our game will be. The first step will be to divide the game into parts that we can work on independently.</p><p>Some of these parts will be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level creation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The main character's appearance</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Player controls</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The game loop—<span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Game Over</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Collecting stuff</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Obstacles that kill the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The graphical user interface</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Storing the player's inventory</p></li></ul></div><p>At this point, this is all I have in mind. I know that some of this probably doesn't make sense to you as of now. I will briefly talk about these parts very soon. There are probably other parts of the game that we will add at a later stage. In fact, this list isn't complete at all, and we will keep updating it whenever a new idea pops up.</p><p>Based on this list of the game's core components, we can have some idea about the game. Take a look at this quick sketch. It will give you a much better idea about how this game will work. I hope you'll like it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_08_2.jpg" /></div><p>I realize that this <a id="id259" class="indexterm"></a>isn't the best game art you have ever seen. At this moment, however, this is all we need to understand the basic game mechanics. As you can see, Jake will be running from left to right. The background will move from right to left, along with all the level elements. Every time Jake hits an obstacle, it's game over. The coins can be collected. I hope you have an idea now. Yet again, we are making a simple game, but you will learn a lot while developing it. Remember that I have promised baby steps forward. We will create something you will be proud of, and I bet you will love to customize it. Why not? You are a game developer. You can create worlds on the screen with no limits whatsoever. Feel free to <a id="id260" class="indexterm"></a>use your own graphics assets or sounds, or simply stick to the ones we have.</p></div>
