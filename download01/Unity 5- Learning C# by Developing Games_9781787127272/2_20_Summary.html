These building blocks are used to create scripts and classes. Understanding how these building blocks work is critical, so you don't feel you're not getting it.</p><p>We discovered that a variable name is a substitute for the value it stores, a method name is a substitute for a block of code, and when a script or class is attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, it becomes a component. The dot syntax is just like an address for locating <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> and components.</p><p>With these concepts under your belt, you can proceed to learn the details of the sentence structure, grammar, and syntax used to work with variables, methods, and the dot syntax. You also learned how to make decisions in code based on variable values. In the next chapter, we will cover the details of using variables.</p></div>
