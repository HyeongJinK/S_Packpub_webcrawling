The following screenshot explains the scope of some variables:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_03_05.jpg" /></div><p>You might have noticed that the rectangular blocks start and end with curly braces. Just like the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, the code between an opening curly brace and a closing curly brace is called a code block. Absolutely wherever in a code you have an opening curly brace, there will be a closing curly brace to match. All of the code between the two braces is a code block. Notice that code blocks can be nested inside other code blocks.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>You normally<a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a> won't create bare blocks of code with curly braces like I did in the <a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>case of <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. Code blocks usually include other things, such as <code class="literal">if</code> statements, looping statements, and methods. This example is just to demonstrate how the scope of a variable works and where a variable exists and is usable.</p></div><p>The following is what you have:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Line 16: string block3 = "Block 3 text";</pre></div><p>The preceding line declares a local string variable named <code class="literal">block3</code>. This variable exists in the code block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. If you try to use the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable outside of <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>, such as in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>, Unity will give you an error message saying that the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable doesn't exist.</p><p>The scope of the <code class="literal">block3</code> variable is the code block defined by the curly braces of lines <span class="strong"><strong>13</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>18</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Line 6: string block1 = "Block 1 text";</pre></div><p>The preceding line declares a string type member variable named <code class="literal">block1</code>. This variable exists in the code block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. This code block begins on line <span class="strong"><strong>5</strong></span> and ends on line <span class="strong"><strong>20</strong></span>. This means that the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable can be used everywhere, including <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>, because they are also within <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is used in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> on line <span class="strong"><strong>10</strong></span> and in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span> on line <span class="strong"><strong>14</strong></span>.</p><p>Thus, the scope of the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is the code block defined by the curly braces between lines <span class="strong"><strong>5</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>20</strong></span>.</p></div>
