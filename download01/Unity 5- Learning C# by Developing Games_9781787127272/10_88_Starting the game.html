<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch10lvl1sec84"></a>Starting the game</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>At the moment, our <a id="id323" class="indexterm"></a>gameplay starts automatically after pressing the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button in Unity. This <a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a>was convenient for testing running and jumping. If you look into the <code class="literal">Start</code> method in <code class="literal">GameManager</code>, you will notice we are calling the start game there. Let's remove that line and keep the <code class="literal">Start</code> method empty for now.</p><p>Further in the development of this game, we will have a nice <span class="strong"><strong>Graphic User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>) to control the game states by pressing buttons like <span class="strong"><strong>Start Game</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span>, and so on. For now, we should focus on functionality only and leave the GUI for later. However, we do need an easy way to call the events at runtime. Why not use the keyboard for now? You probably remember using <code class="literal">Input.GetKeyDown</code>. If you don't remember much, dive into Unity Scripting Reference again and search for <code class="literal">Input.GetKeyDown</code>.</p><p>Let's say when each time user presses <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> on the keyboard, we will fire up the <code class="literal">StartGame</code> method on <code class="literal">GameManager</code>. Before we start adding code, we need to make sure that <code class="literal">currentGameState</code> is set to <code class="literal">inMenu</code> just after pressing <span class="strong"><strong>Unity</strong></span> button. To achieve this, simply edit <code class="literal">Start</code> method in <code class="literal">GameManager</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void Start() {
  currentGameState = GameState.menu;
}</pre></div><p>In Unity, after pressing <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>, Jake has running and jumping disabled as the current state is <code class="literal">inMenu</code>. This is how we expect it to work now. Let's add more code to call the <code class="literal">StartGame</code> method on keyboard press. Write the <code class="literal">Update</code> method within the <code class="literal">GameManager</code> class:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787127272/graphics/B04245_10_4.jpg" /></div><p>With your coding experience, you can definitely understand what we are doing here. Every time the button <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> is <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>pressed on the keyboard, the <code class="literal">StartGame()</code> method <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>will be called.</p></div>
