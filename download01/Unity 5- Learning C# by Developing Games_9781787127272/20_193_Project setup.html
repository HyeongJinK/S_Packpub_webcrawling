Although you may think a level designer will just jump into the editor and start playing, the truth is that you normally would need to do a ton of planning ahead of time before you even open up your tool.</p><p>In general, a level begins with an idea. This can come from anything; maybe you saw a really cool building, or a photo on the Internet gave you a certain feeling; maybe you want to teach the player a new mechanic. Turning this idea into a level is what a level designer does. Taking all of these ideas, the level designer will create a level design document, which will outline exactly what you're trying to achieve with the entire level from start to end.</p><p>A level design document will describe everything inside the level; listing all of the possible encounters, puzzles, so on and so forth, which the player will need to complete as well as any side quests that the player will be able to achieve. To prepare for this, you should include as many references as you can with maps, images, and movies similar to what you're trying to achieve. If you're working with a team, making this document available on a website or wiki will be a great asset so that you know exactly what is being done in the level, what the team can use in their levels, and how difficult their encounters can be. In general, you'll also want a top-down layout of your level done either on a computer or with a graph paper, with a line showing a player's general route for the level with encounters and missions planned out.</p><p>Of course, you <a id="id816" class="indexterm"></a>don't want to be too tied down to your design document and it will change as you playtest and work on the level, but the documentation process will help solidify your ideas and give you a firm basis to work from.</p><p>For those of you interested<a id="id817" class="indexterm"></a> in seeing some level design documents, feel free to check out <span class="emphasis"><em>Adam Reynolds</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Level Designer on Homefront</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Call of Duty: World at War</em></span>) at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Level_Design:_Level_Design_Document_Example" target="_blank">http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php?title=Level_Design:_Level_Design_Document_Example</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note87"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to learn more about level design, I'm a big fan of <span class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Game Level Design</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>John Feil </em></span>(previously my teacher)<span class="emphasis"><em> and Marc Scattergood</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cengage Learning PTR</em></span>.
