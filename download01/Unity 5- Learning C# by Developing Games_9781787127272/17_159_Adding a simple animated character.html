We will talk about animations in more detail in the next chapter, but currently, this will always just play an animation using these three frames over and over again unless we stop it via code.</p></li><li><p>The plane looks a bit large for me, so I'm going to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to <code class="literal">.5, .5, 1</code>.
