The scope is determined by the <span class="emphasis"><em>opening</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>closing</em></span> curly braces. The purpose of those curly braces is to act as a container for a block of executable code—a code block. In the second chapter, you understood that a method is a code block that can execute by just calling the method's name. It's time to understand the importance of code blocks and the variables used in them. A method defines a code block that begins and ends with curly braces.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using methods in a script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Naming methods the good way</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Defining a method</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Calling a method</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Returning a value from a method</p></li></ul></div><p>Variables are the first major building block of C# and methods are the second, so let's dive into methods.</p></div>
