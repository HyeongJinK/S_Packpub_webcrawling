<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec46"></a>List&lt;T&gt; versus arrays</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Now you are probably<a id="id168" class="indexterm"></a> thinking, "OK, which one should I use?" There isn't any general rule for this. Arrays and List&lt;T&gt; can serve the same purpose. You can find a lot of additional information online to convince you to use one or the other.</p><p>Arrays are generally<a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a> faster. For what we are doing at this stage, we don't need to worry about processing speeds. Some time from now, however, you might need a bit more speed if your game slows down, so this is good to remember.</p><p>List&lt;T&gt; offers great flexibility. You don't need to know the size of the list during declaration. There is a massive list of <span class="emphasis"><em>out-of-the-box</em></span> operations that you can use with List, so it is my recommendation. Array is faster, List&lt;T&gt; is more flexible.</p></div>
