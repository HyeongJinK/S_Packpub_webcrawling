When you write a line of code, it's called a statement, with a semicolon used to end the statement.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"></a>Note</h3><p>The reason a statement ends with a semicolon is so that Unity knows when the statement ends. A period can't be used because it is used in the dot syntax.</p></div><p>The code for a C# statement does not have to be on a single line as shown in the following example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public int number1 = 2;</pre></div><p>The statement can be on several lines. Whitespace and carriage returns are ignored, so, if you really want to, you can write it as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public
int
number1
=
2;</pre></div><p>However, I do not recommend writing <a id="id97" class="indexterm"></a>your code like this because it's terrible to read code that is formatted like the preceding code. Nevertheless, there will be times when you'll have to write long statementsâ€”longer than one line. Unity won't care. It just needs to see the semicolon at the end.</p></div>
