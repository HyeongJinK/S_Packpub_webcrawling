We've looked into the basic functionality, constructed a motion cycle from scratch and tried out different approaches based on the available animation clips and character rigs. But there is a lot more to be learned if you are really interested in this tool and want to get the best out of it. Programming, despite delegating most of its work to Mecanim, still makes a vital contribution, by setting parameters and supporting more advanced features such as IKs, so make sure to communicate to your programmers constantly if you, yourself, aren't in charge of the code.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue to look into other features available in Unity that will make our level shine (literally) and relay best practices via tutorials and discussions.</p></div>
