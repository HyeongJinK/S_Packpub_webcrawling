Being extremely easy to use and modify, this native asset is also optimized, allowing artists to push their creative boundaries even further than they usually can with imported terrains.</p><p>Our outdoor level will start with a base terrain that will replace a primitive we've used for the ground, on the greyblock, in our last chapter. To create one, go to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span>. This will spawn a terrain asset in your Hierarchy view and place it in the Scene.</p><p>Terrain is just like any other GameObject with two key components attached to it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Collider</strong></span> component <a id="id149" class="indexterm"></a>creates a collider for the terrain. Though you can't see the usual bounding box around it, it's actually there. Its shape is defined by the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Data</strong></span> parameter that has the terrain object itself assigned to it as a reference (<span class="strong"><strong>New Terrain</strong></span>). This terrain object can be found in the Project window and is created along with the terrain. You can rename it or assign a different reference to the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Data</strong></span> parameter; however, in truth, I can't see a situation where you would need to do that.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Tree Collider</strong></span> parameter is not that transparent; we will talk about trees in future topics and how to properly set them up. For now, it is enough to say that this parameter allows trees to utilize the colliders attached to them.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> component is a script that holds all the functionality and tools that you will be working with, on your terrain. This is something we need to talk about in depth, so here it goes.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec37"></a>Sculpting</h3></div></div></div><p>The first three tools <a id="id150" class="indexterm"></a>on the left of your<a id="id151" class="indexterm"></a> toolbox are used for various sculpting purposes.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_02.jpg" /></div><p>The tools are very simple and self-explanatory, as they allow most of their parameters to be altered in the <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> section, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span>. These are percent-based parameters that are regulated with a slider.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> is based on the size of the texture it is represented by a parameter value of 100 and can be scaled down with a slider.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> controls the strength of the applied effect and is ultimately based on a <a id="id152" class="indexterm"></a>grayscale <a id="id153" class="indexterm"></a>gradient of the brush texture; lowering the value will bring it closer to white. Whenever you are using these tools, what you are actually doing is painting the heightmap of the terrain which is constantly being updated.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Raise/Lower Terrain</strong></span> is your common go-to tool for terrain sculpting (the leftmost button).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Holding the left mouse button and drawing over the terrain surface will lift it</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Holding the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key while doing that will apply the opposite effect</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>You have to move the brush in order to keep reapplying this effect or simply click multiple times while readjusting the brush position.</p></div></li></ul></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Height</strong></span> tool will allow you to raise the terrain to a height determined by the <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> parameter using the brush. It's perfect to create plateaus or if you are in need of greater control over the terrain height.</p><p>Holding <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> over a certain area will take a sample of its height and assign that value to the <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> parameter. Clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Flatten</strong></span> button next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> parameter will bring the entire terrain to the specified height.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>One important thing to keep in mind is that you can't go to a height below 0 when editing terrain, which means that creating a hole in the ground will require raising the entire terrain first and then lowering the area of the hole with the <span class="strong"><strong>Raise/Lower Terrain</strong></span> tool.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Smooth Height</strong></span> tool averages the nearest height values to create a smoother looking terrain.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_03.jpg" /></div></div></div>
