The one in question here is called the projector.</p><p>The projector is used to project material onto the object to create interesting effects such as decals, cinema screen projection, or even shadows. The latter is well known for being hyped by developers and very useful whenever you're in need of a cheap dynamic shadow effect. We will take a closer look at the component itself and showcase some interesting uses of it.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec86"></a>Basic application</h3></div></div></div><p>Being a normal <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>component, <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> can be attached to the GameObject by going to: <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window or <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> from the top menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_39.jpg" /></div><p>Create an empty GameObject and add the <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> component to it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_40.jpg" /></div><p>Using the projector becomes very intuitive if you treat it as a real projector that can project an image from a source to a surface. However, there are few noticeable distinctions; the most noticeable being the way it influences the objects that come within contact.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> tool has no effect on the projector, so the only way to control its area of effect is via the component parameters:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Near Clip Plane</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Far Clip Plane</strong></span> controls the distance from the object from which the cone will <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>start and end, allowing you to set how far the projection will go and where it can start from.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Field Of View</strong></span> controls the width of the cone, while <span class="strong"><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></span> allows you to set its relation to height (a value of 2 will make height twice the width).</p><p>Checking the <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> checkbox will turn the cone into a cube and enable the use of <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic Size</strong></span> parameters that controls the cube's size.</p><p>There are quite a few parameters, but the latter two are the ones that really matter:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> sets the material that will be projected. Make sure to count in the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> properties when considering projecting something, naturally, different <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span>
<a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a> will have different results.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ignore Layers</strong></span> allows you to select layers that will be affected by this projector; if you don't specify the exact layers, it will project the texture on everything that is within the affected area and that might bring some unexpected results.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_41.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, from the preceding screenshot, the projector isn't casting the material from the source to the destination through objects on the way, but rather applies specified material on <a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a>all objects within the affected area.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec87"></a>Other applications</h3></div></div></div><p>As was mentioned<a id="id474" class="indexterm"></a> earlier, the projector can go a long way if used creatively. To get the most out of it, we will require some additional assets available in <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span>:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to<span class="strong"><strong> Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Hit <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> to get the required assets to <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Projectors</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>With the new package, we get access to two new shaders that are specifically made to be used with the <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> component—<span class="strong"><strong>Projector Light</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Projector Multiply</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_42.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Projector Light</strong></span> can be used to create efficient light effects and in some occasions, be used instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Spot Light</strong></span>. Use the <span class="strong"><strong>Blob Light Projector</strong></span> prefab and see it for yourself.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_43.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Projector </strong></span>
<a id="id475" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Multiply</strong></span> on the other hand is perfectly suited to create artificial shadows. One in particular is the shadow underneath the character that would have otherwise required a dynamic lighting to create. Use <span class="strong"><strong>Blob Shadow Projector</strong></span> and add the character object layer to the <span class="strong"><strong>Ignore</strong></span> list of the <span class="strong"><strong>Projector</strong></span> component to achieve this effect.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_44.jpg" /></div><p>The key to using <a id="id476" class="indexterm"></a>new shaders are textures.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_45.jpg" /></div><p>Both <span class="strong"><strong>Projector/Light</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Projector/Multiply</strong></span> have two required texture parameters—<span class="strong"><strong>Cookie</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>FallOff</strong></span>.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cookie</strong></span> is a <a id="id477" class="indexterm"></a>texture that will be projected onto the surface. Make sure to set the created texture <span class="strong"><strong>Wrap Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Clamp</strong></span> in order to get it to work right (you can always refer to how <span class="strong"><strong>Light</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow</strong></span> textures are set, if in doubt). <span class="strong"><strong>FallOff</strong></span> is an optional texture that lets you specify the falloff gradient. <span class="strong"><strong>Projector/Light</strong></span> has a <span class="strong"><strong>Main Color</strong></span> parameter that allows us to set the color of the light we are trying to fake.</p></div></div>
