It's a very neat and interesting feature that works surprisingly fast on modern computers. However, despite its fantastic optimization, it is still noticeable, especially when you are working with reflections that take much longer time to be calculated compared to lights. To enable calculation on demand, do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the <a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span> window (<span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Lighting</strong></span>).</p></li><li><p>At the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab, uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Continuous Baking</strong></span> option.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_37.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, if you need to calculate the lighting, you can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button next to it and execute the process on demand.</p><p>When you disable the <span class="strong"><strong>Continuous Baking</strong></span> feature and rely on <span class="strong"><strong>build on demand</strong></span>
<a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a> with the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button, Unity will be taking a snapshot of the level's lightmap, create a folder that has the same name as the level and store the snapshot there.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_38.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec85"></a>Adding probes to the level</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we've<a id="id468" class="indexterm"></a> briefly covered the light and reflection probes, it's about time to include them in our level. Look at different places that the character can visit and add the net of light probes there, to sample the light around that area.</p><p>Do the same thing with reflection probes, try to cover as big an area as possible with them and add new ones in places where the reflection will noticeably change.</p><p>It order to keep track of all probes, I recommend creating a new layer called <span class="strong"><strong>Probes</strong></span> and assigning all probes to it. This way you can hide them in the editor when you are done placing them.</p></div></div>
