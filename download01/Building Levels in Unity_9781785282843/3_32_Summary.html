We really did cover a lot of ground with this one! All this work comes with the added benefit of you now being familiar with both the essential and situational tools needed to kick off the creation of any level. There are lots of things to be discovered about each of these tools, especially Water, Windzones, Skyboxes, and Tree Creation, that we've only scratched the surface of. Visit community forums if you have any specific questions or problems you can't find solutions to, and read the official documentation if you want in-depth technical information on how things work under the hood.</p><p>Sadly, while it is true that Unity doesn't always offer the best tools on the market for level creation, it does come with a large collection of user-created plugins and rich customization options that will allow you to push the power of Unity far ahead and get the tools that your team is looking for. The addition of SpeedTree app support and the ability to bring in custom terrains via heightmaps, will enable you to work with the tools of your liking.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look into animations and how they are handled, imported, and even created in Unity.</p></div>
