It's flexible and easy to use, with the additional benefits of reducing programmer involvement in building animation systems and shortening the development cycle in general. This is the part where you'll learn why that is the case.</p><p>Throughout the chapter, we will look into the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The animator tool's basics and functionalities</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creation and control of state machines</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Blending, combining, and layering motions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating basic locomotion</p></li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to setup, control, and maintain animation systems in a matter of minutes with minimum reliance on coding. We will look into different case scenarios based on available animations, functionality requirements, and rigs. Without further ado, let's get started!</p></div>
