Publishing for multiple platforms with Unity is as simple as it can possibly be. Currently, Unity supports 21 platforms, some of them are available out of the box, while others require additional modules and third-party SDKs (consoles) to publish.</p><p>Out-of-the-box solutions for the input key binding, quality settings, and publishing are very useful, but generic, and will result in a lot of developers reinventing them to better suit their needs. However, that only applies at the end of development; mid-development you are still benefiting from them, especially if the level is developed for multiple platforms.</p><p>Thank you for finishing this book! We hope that you've managed to follow the book's tutorials, have tried out the optional tasks, and now feel comfortable inside of Unity. What you've learned in this book is just the tip of the iceberg when we compare it to everything that is available inside of Unity, and, who knows, Unity technologies improve their creation regularly, so by the time you read these lines, they might release yet another feature that will help to further simplify your working pipeline. However, until then, keep learning, keep experimenting, and have a great time working with Unity.</p></div>
