That is a huge shame, since well-tuned and arranged sound effects can greatly benefit the level in creating substance and reinforcing the theme.</p><p>With Unity 5, we have great tools that can help us in achieving a varied and rich sound design for our levels. Throughout this chapter, we will look into different topics associated with sound design in Unity and will learn the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How does sound work in Unity 5</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating and configuring sound receivers and emitters</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Starting with the audio mixer to arrange, mix, and manipulate sound effects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to utilize reverb zone and audio filters to add environmental influence</p></li></ul></div><p>Sound effects may be an alien topic to many developers; therefore, we will only cover the material that doesn't require knowledge of audio design and examples that you can recreate and test without reliance on code. However, the topics you will learn in this chapter will help you start with, and guide you into, the areas you might want to explore in pursuit of more complicated sound setups; and if you are already familiar with the topic, you may find a way to apply that knowledge inside of Unity.</p></div>
