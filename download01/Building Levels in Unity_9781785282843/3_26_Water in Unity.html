<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec30"></a>Water in Unity</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Unity 5 comes with three <a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a>different water solutions; they are varied in the level of complexity and hardware requirements. Despite this variety, water in Unity is nothing but aesthetical. It doesn't react to physical objects or add post-processing to the camera when a character gets under it. But, I can't really count that as a negative since rarely do games require water to be more than just a good-looking plane. If you are in need of a more realistic solution for your project, you just may find what you are looking for in the Unity Asset Store.</p><p>If you have the Environment package imported, water prefabs can be found under the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span>, inside of which you can navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water 4</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water (Basic)</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_24.jpg" /></div><p>We are going to keep <a id="id183" class="indexterm"></a>the introduction to Unity Water short and focus on one of the available Water solutions. Find the <span class="strong"><strong>WaterProDaytime</strong></span> prefab in <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> and drag it into the scene.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_25.jpg" /></div><p>If we take a close look<a id="id184" class="indexterm"></a> at the GameObject, we'll see that there are two things that are turning it into Unity Water: the <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span> component and <span class="strong"><strong>WaterProDaytime</strong></span> material, that both contain important parameters to control Water behavior.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_26.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Water Mode</strong></span> has three <a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a>options that depend completely on which shader version the user's video card supports:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Simple</strong></span> works on most graphic cards</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reflective</strong></span> requires pixel shader 1.4 support and above</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Refractive</strong></span> requires 2.0 pixel shader support</p></li></ul></div><p>You don't have to worry about this too much as Unity will downscale the settings if any specific mode isn't supported. However, it does add additional work by having to adjust the settings of every mode, just in case.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Texture Size</strong></span> parameter and <span class="strong"><strong>Disable Pixel Lighting</strong></span> are self-explanatory.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reflect</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Refract Layers</strong></span> allow you to pick and choose layers that you don't want to reflect on the water surface.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wave scale</strong></span> controls the Normal map values: the lower the slider value, the higher the waves will be.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Refraction</strong></span> and <a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reflection distort</strong></span> control by how much the object reflected on the water surface, will be distorted.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Refraction color</strong></span> colors the water surface with a certain hue (helps to set the mood, because water in the <span class="strong"><strong>Refraction</strong></span> mode is mostly transparent).</p><p>If you want to try something more complex with a lot more options to play with, try <span class="strong"><strong>Water4</strong></span> under <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Water4</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Water4Advanced</strong></span> prefab has waves rising and falling as well as foaming around objects below the water plane (they aren't real though).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_27.jpg" /></div><p>That will be it for the introduction of Water. It's a very niche and limited feature that works only for visual representation. For our level, we will continue using the <span class="strong"><strong>WaterProDaytime</strong></span> prefab and duplicate it along the river bank.</p></div>
