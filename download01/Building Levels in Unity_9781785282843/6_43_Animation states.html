<a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a> a change in our animation?</p><p>Let's start with the most basic example, switching from standing to walking, or, in our case, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Idle_Neutral_1</strong></span> animation to the <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> animation.

That's what blend trees allow us to achieve.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec17"></a>Overview</h4></div></div></div><p>To better understand <a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a>animation blending, let's compare it to the animation transition that we've seen in the previous example. With animation transition, we move from one animation to another with a short period of linear interpolation in between; animation blending is that short period of interpolation. Blend trees allow us to set multiple animations and define when and how they are going to affect the character by controlling them with parameters.</p><p>The most basic example of the use of the blend trees will be creating a smooth transition from walking to running. If you've ever played a third person game with a gamepad, you might have noticed how smoothly the character goes from walking to running as you slowly tilt the joystick forwardâ€”that's the exact feel that we can achieve using blend trees.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec18"></a>Creating a blend tree</h4></div></div></div><p>Think of the <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>blend trees as a more advanced version of animation states that we've used recently. Their creation process is very similar as well:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Right-click on the empty area of the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> window</p></li><li><p>Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Create State</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>From New Blend Tree</strong></span>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_10.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>This will create a new block that is deceptively similar to the usual animation state.</p><p>Blend tree transitions work in the exact same way as the animation state transition, so much that we can simply convert our previously created <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> state into a <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> blend tree by:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Right <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> state.</p></li><li><p>Selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Blend Tree in State</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_11.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Using the latter method will allow us to preserve all transition conditions we've built before.</p><p>You might gain an impression that using the blend trees should be the default way to go. That is however, not true, you only need to rely on them for animation blending, otherwise, stick to using states, they are much simpler.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec19"></a>Inside the blend tree</h4></div></div></div><p>Double-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> will<a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a> take us inside of it, to where all the blending happens.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_12.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, we already have a slider with a <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> parameter control. That is partially because that is the only parameter we have available at the moment. This parameter will be controlling the blend between the animations. Now, with <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> selected, let's take a quick<a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a> look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_13.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Parameter</strong></span> field specifies the parameter that will be controlling the animation blending (<span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span>, in our case).</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> contains the list of animation clips and blend trees that we can blend between:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Hit the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign of the <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list and add two motion fields.</p></li><li><p>Assign the <span class="strong"><strong>WalkFWD</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> animation clips to them (<span class="strong"><strong>WalkFWD</strong></span> at the top and <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> at the bottom).</p></li></ol></div><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> window, you should now get something like the tree diagram on this figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_14.jpg" /></div><p>Notice how the<a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>WalkFWD</strong></span> state is a little bit brighter than the <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> state, with the <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> parameter set at <code class="literal">0</code>, and switches as soon as we bring it to a max of <code class="literal">1</code>. That is the sign of blending, with the dominant clip being brighter. Not only that, but even the connecting cord color changes from blue to white based on which animation clip is currently dominant. This is to show how blend trees are going to work; the actual controls to these blends is in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, that now contains more parameters with previously added clips.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_15.jpg" /></div><p>Right below the blending <span class="strong"><strong>Parameter</strong></span>, you will find a pyramid graph that maps added motions to the <span class="strong"><strong>Parameter</strong></span> value. With two animations, we can clearly see that one of them is fully affecting the character at the <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> value of <code class="literal">0</code>, while linearly blending into a different animation by the time the parameter value reaches <code class="literal">1</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note23"></a>Note</h3><p>Left click and hold on any pyramid to see which animation clip it corresponds to.</p></div><p>
<code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">1</code> <a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a>values are given to parameters by default; we can change that by modifying the maximum <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> value of the motions. All the motions listed, share the animation weight scale, meaning that the threshold is a point at which a single animation gets a 100 percent of the weight while others have no effect at all. This means that there is a value of the animation <span class="strong"><strong>Parameter</strong></span> at which only a single animation will be played. To change the <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> field, make sure to uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Automate Thresholds</strong></span> box right below it. Let's change the <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> value of the <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> motion to <code class="literal">4</code> to better represent what's happening in the scene.</p><p>The aforementioned <span class="strong"><strong>Automate Thresholds,</strong></span> is actually a very useful parameter to keep in mind. It's main purpose is to evenly distribute all motions in between their min and max Thresholds. For example, if we were to add an additional motion in between walking and running, set it's <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> to <code class="literal">1</code> and check <span class="strong"><strong>Automate Threshold</strong></span>, it will instantly jump to <code class="literal">2</code> (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">2</code>, <code class="literal">4</code>).</p><p>But what is actually happening when you add more than two motions? How do they share the graph? The rules are simple, but they aren't very intuitive from the first glance, it goes like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Each motion must have a <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> at which it becomes the only motion affecting the model</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>At any point in time, animations have to share the 100 percent effect on the model</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Each motion down the <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list, should have a higher <span class="strong"><strong>Threshold</strong></span> value than the one above</p></li></ul></div><p>The first one is very easy to work around; if you don't wish a particular animation to be played without blending, just set its threshold at the point that the animation <span class="strong"><strong>Parameter</strong></span> won't reach.</p><p>The second one uses the same principal as, let's say, vertex weight painting; at any point in time, no animation or group of animations can affect the model more than 100 percent; if there are two animations and one of them is affecting the model at 80 percent, the affect of the other animation can't be anything but 20 percent, or there is no blending.</p><p>The third is more of a <a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a>recommendation, if you try to force a lower threshold, it will overlap with over motions and the results will be unpleasant to look at; this also makes sure that you don't have more than two active motions at a time.</p><p>But what if there is an actual need to blend more than two motions? Is there a way to do that? Certainly there is, but it might become a little bit hard to manage. The way to do that is by adding another <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list instead of the <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> field.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_16.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec20"></a>Other blend tree options</h4></div></div></div><p>There are two <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>other parameters in the motion list that are worth mentioning, next to the threshold:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">
A clock sign <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_17.jpg" /></span> is an animation speed parameter and is particularly useful if you are trying to create a reverse motion, such as creating a landing motion from a jumping motion
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">
Mirror animation <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_18.jpg" /></span> is available only for the humanoid rigs and allows you to mirror animation from one side of the body to another using an avatar
</li></ul></div><p>There are also two functions available at the very bottom:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Compute </strong></span>
<a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Thresholds</strong></span> is an interesting one. It allows you to automatically compute the threshold values based on the motion at the root of the animation. This basically means that if you have a walking and running animation that moves the character, you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span> parameter from the drop-down menu to control them and set up thresholds based on the speed at which the character moves. That is, however, completely useless if there is no root motion. The parameters available are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Speed (the magnitude of velocity)</p></li><li><p>Velocity X</p></li><li><p>Velocity Y</p></li><li><p>Velocity Z</p></li><li><p>Angular Speed (Rad)</p></li><li><p>Angular Speed (Deg)</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec67"></a>Adjust Time Scale</h3></div></div></div><p>If you've added a <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> to the <a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a>motion <a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a>list, delete it for this parameter to show up. Choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Homogeneous Speed</strong></span> will allow you to rescale the speed of animations based on the minimum and maximum value set in the motion list. Naturally, some animations can have different speed and length; however, blending has to find a compromise and readjust them so that all motions are played in a single blending. <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Time Scale</strong></span> will return the value of the animation speed to 1.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec68"></a>Layers</h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike animation blending, which is <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>a transition from one animation to another, there is a <a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a>demand for combining different animations to create new ones.

There is no transition from one layer to another and every layer has to have its own state system that will work independently from other layers. As such, our newly created <span class="strong"><strong>Wave</strong></span> layer will theoretically be in two possible states, the waving state and the passive state, which is all we require of it. Following this logic, we will need to create two states:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The first state will be called <span class="strong"><strong>Passive</strong></span> and should contain no animation clip and be set to default</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The second state will be called <span class="strong"><strong>Waving</strong></span> and will contain <span class="strong"><strong>Robot_Armature|Robot_ArmatureAction</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Clip</strong></span> that was imported with our robot</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_22.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>To control the state<a id="id348" class="indexterm"></a> transition, we will add a new parameter <a id="id349" class="indexterm"></a>of a trigger type and call it <span class="strong"><strong>Waved</strong></span>. Waved is controlled by code and will be enabled by a click; which transits us to the <span class="strong"><strong>Waving</strong></span> state and uncheck itself immediately (unlike bool, we don't need to bother disabling trigger via code). We also require two transitions from and to the <span class="strong"><strong>Passive</strong></span> state:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>From <span class="strong"><strong>Passive</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Waving</strong></span> will be controlled by the <span class="strong"><strong>Waved</strong></span> trigger, for that we need to list it under <span class="strong"><strong>Conditions</strong></span>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_23.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>That's about it. With <a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a>everything set correctly, we should be <a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a>able to walk/run forward and wave with our hand.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec69"></a>2D blending</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's get back to blending for just a<a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a> second, or two. So far, we've looked into a blending mode controlled by a single parameter to make our walk to run transition possible; however, apart from walking in a straight line, we could also benefit from smoothly turning right and left instead of rapidly switching directions. To control this, we require an input from both the vertical and horizontal axes, there are twice as many parameters. Thankfully, Unity has got us covered here by providing 2D blending with various variations to suit our needs.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec23"></a>Blending variations</h4></div></div></div><p>Looking at the <a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a>blend tree in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, you probably have noticed that we've omitted speaking about a parameter called <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Type</strong></span>. This is done on purpose, as most blend types work in a similar fashion, as default <span class="strong"><strong>1D</strong></span> blending that we've looked at, with a layer of their own complexity deriving from working with twice as many parameters. So if, by any chance, you didn't fully grasp how <span class="strong"><strong>1D</strong></span> blending works, I would strongly recommend you go back and look at the examples provided with this chapter, along with the official documentation that comes with Unity (by clicking on the bookmark next to the <span class="strong"><strong>BlendTree</strong></span> name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window), as the topic we are about to <a id="id354" class="indexterm"></a>discuss will heavily rely on the previous material.</p><p>Feel confident? Good, let's move on!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_24.jpg" /></div><p>The drop down menu of the <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Type</strong></span> parameter contains four options, as follows:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>1D</strong></span>: The blending is controlled by one parameter, the one we've already looked at.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>2D Simple Directional</strong></span>: This is the motion that is controlled by two parameters that represent direction. Taking walking as the example, we can use vertical and horizontal speeds as two directional parameters to control the single motion of walking. With this particular 2D blending type, we are limited to a single motion for single direction; therefore, no transition to running is possible.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>2D Freeform Directional</strong></span>: This is just like the previous one, but with no single motion restriction. <span class="strong"><strong>Walking</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Jogging</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Running</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sprinting</strong></span>: You name it and it can be incorporated into this blending type.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>2D Freeform Cartesian</strong></span>: This type is better used with controlling parameters that don't represent directions, for something like angles.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Direct</strong></span>: This allows<a id="id355" class="indexterm"></a> you to directly control the blend parameter. It also allows you to assign a unique parameter to each motion for it to be controlled manually, which is perfect for facial expressions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec24"></a>It's all about the dots</h4></div></div></div><p>In the <a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a>following example, we will use <span class="strong"><strong>2D Freeform Directional Blend Type</strong></span>. We will require a second parameter, which we will call <span class="strong"><strong>XSpeed</strong></span> of a type <span class="strong"><strong>Float</strong></span> and a 3rd motion in a <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list left empty. Your <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window should now look similar to the one on the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_25.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Don't worry about getting the exact color grading, it will change based on the selected element</p></div></div><p>At first glance, this looks nothing like the simple graph from 1D blending; however, it is actually quite similar to, if not better than, a representation of motion transition.</p><p>Take a look at the <a id="id357" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list. Instead of the familiar threshold, we find <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span>, which are in fact, the thresholds of the first and the second controlled parameters (<span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> is represented by the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> axis and <span class="strong"><strong>XSpeed</strong></span> by the <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> axis of the diagram). <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> motion positions are projected on the 2D plane and represented by the blue icons.</p><p>Here is how the mapping works. The origin is located in the center of the diagram with <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> values increasing from left to right, while <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> values do the same from the bottom to the top.</p><p>By clicking on any blue icon, you will see a motion that it corresponds to, highlighted in the <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> list or vice versa; selecting the motion from the list will highlight it on the diagram.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_06_26.jpg" /></div><p>By selecting <a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a>different motions, you will notice that the color of the diagram changes. The color indicates the weight of the specific motion in certain ranges of <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> values, with saturation of the blue color indicating the weight influence. With the <span class="strong"><strong>Run_Impulse</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Motion</strong></span> selected, you can see, on the diagram, that from its threshold position (<code class="literal">2</code>,<code class="literal">0</code>), it has full control over the animation; however, it gains less influence when closer to the origin, at which the <span class="strong"><strong>WalkFWD</strong></span> motion threshold is set.</p><p>The grey icon represents the motion list items that don't have animation clips selected for them (which is the empty clip that we've just created).</p><p>The red icon is our current value of two controlled parameters. You can change the values of <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>XSpeed</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> block and see it changing its position accordingly; or you can simply drag it within the diagram yourself and see the character react to the changes in the <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> window. You can change the positions of blue and grey icons that way as well.</p><p>Last, but not<a id="id359" class="indexterm"></a> least, there is a circle around the blue icons which is a visual representation of the weight of the particular motion that it is circled around; the bigger the influence, the bigger the radius of the circle. You can try to drag the red icon from one motion to another and see the radius of circles around blue icons change.</p><p>Hopefully, this overview will make this diagram a little bit easier to read and manage as we are about to take a look at how to use it to create a full walk/run cycle for our character.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec70"></a>Creating locomotion</h3></div></div></div><p>Sounds like a little bit too <a id="id360" class="indexterm"></a>much to take in, well, let's take it in a more digestible form, and take a stepâ€“by-step approach to create a working character locomotion:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new animation controller and call it <span class="strong"><strong>Robot_Locomotion</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Assign it to the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> controller parameter of the robot.</p></li><li><p>Add the <span class="strong"><strong>Locomotion</strong></span> script to the robot components (located in the <code class="literal">Chapter 6</code> folder) and remove (or deactivate) <span class="strong"><strong>MoveForward</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec25"></a>Setup</h4></div></div></div><p>Here is a list of motions <a id="id361" class="indexterm"></a>that we will aim to create:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Walking (forward and backward)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Strafing (right and left)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Turning (while walking and on the spot)</p></li></ul></div><p>This will allow us to make full use of animations that we have and will require minimum code support.</p><p>Regarding parameters, there are three that we will require:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Float <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>XSpeed</strong></span> to control movement and rotation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Bool <span class="strong"><strong>Strafing</strong></span> to know when our character needs to strafe and to avoid conflict with the walking cycle</p></li></ul></div><p>Add these parameters to the previously created <span class="strong"><strong>Robot_Locomotion</strong></span> animation controller, the script will take care of the input and will change parameters accordingly, so we don't have to worry about them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec26"></a>Walking</h4></div></div></div><p>We will utilize a blend tree to help us create a<a id="id362" class="indexterm"></a> walking cycle.</p><p>Create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span> and rename it; <span class="strong"><strong>Locomotion</strong></span>.</p><p>To control this <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Tree</strong></span>, we will require two parameters, <span class="strong"><strong>ZSpeed</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>XSpeed</strong></span>.
