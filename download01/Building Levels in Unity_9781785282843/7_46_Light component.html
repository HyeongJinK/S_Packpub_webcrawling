The general <a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a>answer will be that it's an electromagnetic radiation visible to an eye. In Unity, light is a component that changes the brightness of the affected objects allowing them to be seen. You can add a light component to any GameObject by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Light</strong></span>; although, I'll have to say that it is a rare method of doing it. Most of the time, you will be adding the lights to your scene as a separated empty GameObjects by navigating in the top menu to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Light</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_01.jpg" /></div><p>The largest inconvenience of having a light attached to a non-empty GameObject is the fact that its position and rotation are tied to those of the object and you can't control it as flexibly as colliders.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_02.jpg" /></div><p>Despite having multiple light<a id="id377" class="indexterm"></a> types available, most of them have many parameters in common:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span>: This allows you to choose between light types.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span>: This is the color that will be emitted by the light.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span>: This controls the brightness of a light.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shadow Type</strong></span>: This determines the type of shadows that objects, lit by this light, will cast. You have an option of <span class="strong"><strong>Hard shadows</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Soft shadows</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>No Shadows</strong></span> at all.</p></li></ul></div><p>The number of parameters will change based on the type of light you are dealing with.</p></div>
