<span class="strong"><strong>Emission</strong></span>: This module is a kind of obvious choiceâ€”those coins need to be emitted after all.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shape</strong></span>: This module is the same as the previous one, which requires source and direction to be properly configured.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>by</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span>: This module is the one we didn't talk about, but it is quite simple to use. It changes the angular velocity of a particle based on the <span class="strong"><strong>Speed Range</strong></span> parameters inside the module.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Collision</strong></span>: This module will allow you to achieve the rolling effect. By changing collision to <span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span>, the coins will collide with the ground. The way they respond to the collision is controlled by the <span class="strong"><strong>Dampen</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bounce</strong></span> parameters.</p></li><li><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Renderer</strong></span>: The <a id="id561" class="indexterm"></a>only thing you will need to modify in this module and is the material used to emit coins.</p></li></ol></div><p>These five modules should be enough. Once you are finished, all that is left to do is as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Find the script called <span class="strong"><strong>OpenChest.cs</strong></span> and assign it as a component to the Chest GameObject in the Scene (by dragging and dropping or by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Scripts</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open Chest</strong></span>).</p></li><li><p>This script has one parameter called <span class="strong"><strong>Coin Particle</strong></span>, drag and drop your particle system to it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_09_13.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now you can test your particle system by entering the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode and pressing the space bar.</p></div>
