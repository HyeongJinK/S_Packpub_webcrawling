We will not discuss any filter in particular, due to their situational nature; however, keep in mind that the order in which you apply filters does matter a great deal, you might not always perceive the difference, but it is there.</p><p>Reverb zones<a id="id532" class="indexterm"></a> are slightly different; they are the spherical volumes (components) that you place in the level to add a reverb to the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Sources</strong></span> if the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> is within the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Zone</strong></span> area.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_08_20.jpg" /></div><p>Let's take a look at the <a id="id533" class="indexterm"></a>example in the <a id="id534" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cave</strong></span> scene inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></span> folder. In the scene, we have a <span class="strong"><strong>Waterfall Audio Source</strong></span>, a <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Zone</strong></span> inside of a cave and an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> attached to the character. The listener is clearly outside of the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Zone</strong></span> area; therefore, the reverb will not be applied. However, as soon as a character moves in, the reverb will start being applied to the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Sources</strong></span> that it can hear. In other words, it doesn't change any <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> in particular, but applies a reverb to a <span class="strong"><strong>Listener</strong></span> affecting how we can hear sounds.</p><p>The reason why I said, <span class="emphasis"><em>it will start being applied</em></span> is because there are two parameters of the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Zone</strong></span> component that control this transition: <span class="strong"><strong>Min Distance</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance</strong></span> between them, the reverb effect goes from 0 percent (beyond max distance) to 100 percent (within min distance).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_08_21.jpg" /></div><p>Reverb zones <a id="id535" class="indexterm"></a>are used to add environmental effects to the sounds. The character enters a cave that has a reverb zone inside of it, with the appropriate settings that will add an acoustic effect to everything he hears.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note31"></a>Note</h3><p>You can choose the available effects from the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Presets</strong></span> drop-down menu, or design your own by choosing the <span class="strong"><strong>User</strong></span> option and tweaking the sliders.</p></div><p>Enter the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode and navigate the character into the cave. Once the character is inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Reverb Zone</strong></span>, add the <span class="strong"><strong>Lowpass Filter</strong></span> to the master group via the <span class="strong"><strong>Add…</strong></span> button at the bottom of it. You should immediately hear the difference and a greater feeling that you've entered the cave.</p><p>There are some scenarios where you don't want sounds to be affected by the reverb zone and filters, more specifically; the background music. To exclude specific audio sources from being affected by the reverb zones and filters, check both <span class="strong"><strong>Bypass Reverb Zones</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bypass Effects</strong></span> boxes of the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> component that plays background music in your level.</p></div>
