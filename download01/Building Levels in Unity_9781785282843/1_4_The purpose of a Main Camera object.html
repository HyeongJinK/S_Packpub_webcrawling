By default there are two camerasâ€”the Editor Camera and a Main Camera. The Editor Camera allows us to see objects in the Scene window and the Main Camera is the one we will be using during play testing. Sure, we can have as many cameras as we want and there are a lot of settings that we can play with, but at this point, it's enough to just be aware of it.</p></div>
