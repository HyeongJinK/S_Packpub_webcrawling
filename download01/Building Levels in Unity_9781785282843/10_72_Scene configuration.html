<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch10lvl1sec69"></a>Scene configuration</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Having one beautiful level is <a id="id576" class="indexterm"></a>wonderful, but what if we have more - how do we connect them to ensure that the player sees them all? The process is actually quite simple and doesn't require much work from our side: any kind of level loading is done via code anyway. However, there are still things that we are required to take care of regardless.</p><p>As you must have noticed already, the levels are represented by scenes in Unity, and during development, we could have a large number of scenes piled up, some of which we would like to see in the final game, while others exist for testing purposes or prototypes. In order to avoid unnecessary assets being added to our final build, we need to list the scenes that will be included.</p><p>To do that, we go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settingsâ€¦</strong></span> of the top menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_10_07.jpg" /></div><p>Right now, we are only interested at the top part of this window, but we shall revisit it later and talk about the rest of the options in the future. <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> is a list of all scenes that will be added to our current build of the game and allows us to manage them for different <a id="id577" class="indexterm"></a>releases. There are few actions that we can do from here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To add a scene to the list, simply open the scene in Unity and hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button in the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To remove the scene from the build, uncheck the box to the left of the scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To remove the scene from the list, select the scene and hit the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key.</p></li></ul></div><p>Should that be it, the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> window will be quite useless. Its major purpose is to assign the scenes an integer number that will be used to reference it in the code. Every consecutive scene will have an incrementally bigger number. In order to change the number, we need to change the ordering of the scene by holding and dragging them up or down through the list. It is a simple, but quite effective, method.</p><p>To proceed with the example of moving from level to level, do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go into your created level and add it to the list.</p></li><li><p>Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter_10_Scene</strong></span> folder inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter10</strong></span> folder and add it to the list as well.</p></li><li><p>Return to your level, drag and drop a <span class="strong"><strong>Level_Exit</strong></span> prefab into the scene (can be found inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter10</strong></span> folder).</p></li><li><p>Position it in a way so that your character is able to reach it by walking.</p></li></ol></div><p>Make sure that both level checkboxes are checked and that they are assigned correct numbers inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> window, as displayed on the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_10_08.jpg" /></div><p>Now that everything is set up, we will be able to test level loading.</p></div>
