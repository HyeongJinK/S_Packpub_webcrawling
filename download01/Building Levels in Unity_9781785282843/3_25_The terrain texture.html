In addition, you can also import some of Unity's built-in packages for greater texture variety.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>This will import some textures for the terrain and tree models that we will use in the future.</p><p>Unity supports multilayered texturing for terrain. It's very intuitive and natural to grasp: imagine multiple textures being stacked on top of each other and all of them share an opacity parameter in a certain area, which allows you to manually increase the opacity of certain textures, and at the same time, lower the opacity of others. This is not exactly how it works under the hood; however, this is what you will experience when working with terrain textures in Unity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_20.jpg" /></div><p>To add textures to the list, simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Texturesâ€¦</strong></span> button and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Texture</strong></span>. This will open a new window where you can select a color and a normal map for that texture. Select <span class="strong"><strong>Dirt_Color</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo</strong></span> parameter, <span class="strong"><strong>Dirt_Normal</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Normal</strong></span> parameter (terrain is currently using the standard shader), and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_21.jpg" /></div><p>Options during <a id="id179" class="indexterm"></a>texture picking are quite straightforward:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span>: This allows you to scale texture up and down along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and/or <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Offset</strong></span>: This just offsets it by a specified amount. You won't find yourself using this option that often, if ever.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, the terrain is now completely covered with this texture. Unity does this all the time; it automatically assumes that the first texture on the list is the default background texture that you want the entire terrain to be covered with, so keep that in mind whenever trying to decide on assignment order.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"></a>Note</h3><p>Once added, there is no way to change the texture order (not that there is much need for it anyway).</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_22.jpg" /></div><p>Texturing settings are very similar to those of terrain sculpting. One thing that you need to keep in mind is that painting a texture over the same spot will increase its opacity by the amount specified in the <span class="strong"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> parameter (63 being 63 percent) up to a <span class="strong"><strong>Target Strength</strong></span> value (1 being 100 percent). This makes it very similar to the Paint Height tool we've looked at before.</p><p>For your own custom <a id="id180" class="indexterm"></a>textures, there are no special requirements that should be met. There are only a few things that are recommended:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The texture must be tileable.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Wrap mode must be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Repeat</strong></span> in texture Import Settings.</p></li></ul></div><p>That will do it. You can add extra textures to your palette and paint over the terrain while getting used to the tool.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec44"></a>Texturing the terrain</h3></div></div></div><p>Try adding the rest of the textures <a id="id181" class="indexterm"></a>from the <code class="literal">Chapter 3</code> folder and using them in the level. How you use and combine them for your level is an artistic call. If you need a reference, you can always refer to the finished level inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter 3 Finished</strong></span> folder in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_23.jpg" /></div></div></div>
