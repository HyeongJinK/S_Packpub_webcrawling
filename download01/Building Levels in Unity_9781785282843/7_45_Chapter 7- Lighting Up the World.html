It plays a major role in setting the mood, directing players, and allowing us to see things in a pitch-dark environment. Working with lighting isn't as simple as trying to imitate the real-world setup. It's a process that involves a lot of witty tricks and optimization techniques, understanding of how the lighting works in the real world and what's going on under the hood of the rendering engine.</p><p>Throughout the chapter, we will look into the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Light types, their functionality and application</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Global Illumination</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Light's influence on dynamic and static objects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Shadows</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Emissive materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Baking Lightmaps</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Light probing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Reflection probes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Projectors</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Light cookies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Halos and lenses</p></li></ul></div><p>Covering every tiny detail might probably take a book of its own, and definitely beyond the scope of an introduction. Instead, we will look at components that make up the lighting system in Unity, discuss the influence of various settings and condition sets on the final result, point out solutions to the most frequent issues and discover interesting techniques to optimize the lighting in the level.</p><p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use Unity light, bake light into lightmaps, set up shadows, create and set up the light and reflection probes, projector, use flare lenses and light cookies.</p></div>
