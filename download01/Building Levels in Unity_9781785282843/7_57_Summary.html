In Unity, lighting isn't without its issues. Attempting to apply real-world logic to 3D rendering will result in a direct confrontation with limitations posed by imperfect simulation. In order to solve issues that may arise, one must first understand what might be causing them, in order to isolate the problem and attempt to find a solution. We attempted to achieve this in this chapter by looking at different light types, discussing what causes lighting to work in a certain manner, and what behavior should be expected from various settings. Knowing these nuances will help you to better apply the available tools and technologies necessary to achieve the desired results with your lighting rigs; and knowledge of projectors, light cookies, halos, and flares will allow enhancing the result even further.</p><p>Alas, there are still a lot of topics left uncovered that are outside of the realm of an introduction. If you wish to learn more about lighting, I would point you again to the official documentation and developer blogs, where you'll find a lot of useful information, tons of theory, practical recommendations, as well as in-depth look into all light elements discussed in this chapter.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will talk about another important component of level ambienceâ€”sound.</p></div>
