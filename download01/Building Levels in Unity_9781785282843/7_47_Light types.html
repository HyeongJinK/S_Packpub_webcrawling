They are <span class="strong"><strong>Directional</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Spot</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Point</strong></span> and, <span class="strong"><strong>Area</strong></span> lights. Like artists keeping different types of pencils for different situations, so should you treat light types as just a brush to brighten up the environment and create the mood with.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec71"></a>Point light</h3></div></div></div><p>Point light<a id="id379" class="indexterm"></a> is the most basic light type that you might find yourself relying on<a id="id380" class="indexterm"></a> most of the time. In a way, a Point light is just a shining dot emitting the light within a specified radius. Point light has a vast amount of use. You can use it to simulate realistic lighting, such as candle light, artificially brighten the area, or use it to light up a pickup, or important objects in the level.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_03.jpg" /></div><p>The position of the <span class="strong"><strong>Point</strong></span> light is very important, but rotation, not so much, since the light is emitting from the same spot in all directions.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Point</strong></span> light is controlled by a singular unique parameter, <span class="strong"><strong>Range</strong></span>, which controls the area of effect and emission radius.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_04.jpg" /></div><p>Range is very important to keep in check because the light will not affect any object outside of the sphere radius. In addition to that, light intensity will fade the further it is from the source reaching zero at the sphere's border.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec72"></a>Spot light</h3></div></div></div><p>This light is represented by a cone with<a id="id381" class="indexterm"></a> light shining from the top of the cone (light's source) to<a id="id382" class="indexterm"></a> its base.</p><p>This particular light is most commonly used whenever you need a light to shine in a particular direction at a controlled distance—flashlights, projectors, streetlights, and so on.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_05.jpg" /></div><p>Just like the Point light, the origin of the transform also serves as a light source; however, since Spot light is limited by the cone, it also needs to take full advantage of rotational parameters.</p><p>Spot light is controlled by two unique parameters that can be found in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_06.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Range</strong></span> controls <a id="id383" class="indexterm"></a>the height of the cone and how far the light will shine. <span class="strong"><strong>Spot Angle</strong></span> <a id="id384" class="indexterm"></a>regulates the base radius allowing the light to cover a bigger area.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_07.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"></a>Note</h3><p>You should not attempt to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> tool to manipulate lights—it will not respond to it. Alternatively, you can manipulate the dots at the bottom of the cone by holding the left mouse button and dragging them to manually adjust the scale.</p></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Spot</strong></span> light <a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a>brightness isn't constant throughout its range, but fades the further it is <a id="id386" class="indexterm"></a>from the light source until it reaches zero at the bottom of the cone. As a result, you can sometimes increase the light's brightness by scaling its <span class="strong"><strong>Range</strong></span> instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span>. Light will not directly affect the objects outside of the cone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec73"></a>Directional light</h3></div></div></div><p>This light shines from<a id="id387" class="indexterm"></a> infinity to <a id="id388" class="indexterm"></a>infinity. This basically means its source isn't coming from the light's position, but outside of the scene, far beyond our reach. Because of that, its position in space is completely irrelevant (though you should be able to find it at any time). Its rotation, on the other hand, is crucial to being sure that it shines at the correct angle. It's primarily used to represent sunlight and moonlight.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_08.jpg" /></div><p>What's also interesting<a id="id389" class="indexterm"></a> is that since <span class="strong"><strong>Directional</strong></span> light does not have any beginning or <a id="id390" class="indexterm"></a>end, its brightness isn't fading in relation to the distance from its position.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec74"></a>Area light</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Area Light</strong></span> is emitting <a id="id391" class="indexterm"></a>light from the entire surface in a facing direction. Should you try to test<a id="id392" class="indexterm"></a> the Area light right now, you will find that it's not affecting any object. This is because, unlike other light types, it's only available as a baked light without real-time support due to intense processing requirements. All of this comes down to it not being able to affect objects at runtime; yes, a character passing by will not be affected by this light without external help. How to make this light work and a process of baking lights will be discussed later in this chapter. Its uses are limited to emitting light from a surface such as computer screens, TVs, or digital billboards.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_09.jpg" /></div><p>As you can notice from the <a id="id393" class="indexterm"></a>preceding screenshot, <span class="strong"><strong>Area Light</strong></span> is emitting in all directions <a id="id394" class="indexterm"></a>hitting the wall, floor, and everything within a 180-degree range, but the TV screen on the opposite side.</p><p>Area light has a very small number of parameters, but there are two that are unique to it: <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span>, which allow control of the size of the rectangle.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_07_10.jpg" /></div><p>The only way to <a id="id395" class="indexterm"></a>control the distance at which Area light shines is by changing its <a id="id396" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Intensity</strong></span>, unlike Point or Spot light; you can't control how far it goes.</p></div></div>
