Fire, sparks of electricity, fireworks, dust, rain, snow, explosions, and magic spellsâ€”all can be created with the use of the particle system that is available in Unity.</p><p>I encourage you to take a look at some of the examples of particle systems available in Unity's standard package by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Particle Systems</strong></span>.</p><p>My personal favorite is the fireworks particle, it can be found under <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>ParticleSystems</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Fireworks</strong></span>. In order to see a particle system in action, simply drag and drop it into the scene and keep it active (selected).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/04214_09_01.jpg" /></div><p>The best part is that all of that beauty can be created by an artist without a single line of code. How? Well, we have an amazing particle editor to thank.</p></div>
