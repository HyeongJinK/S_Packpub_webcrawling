<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"></a>Prefabs</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Let's say you've configured a <a id="id103" class="indexterm"></a>GameObject and its components, and you now want to reuse it multiple times throughout the project. Duplication is an option; however, there is a much better way, in the form of prefabs.</p><p>Think about prefabs as templatesâ€”they are generally used to create instances of certain objects and quickly modify them by applying changes made to the templates.</p><p>Creating <a id="id104" class="indexterm"></a>prefabs is easy:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Drag and drop a primitive created earlier onto the prefab.</p></li></ol></div><p>Done! Now you can observe how the prefab <a id="id105" class="indexterm"></a>works. Notice that our original primitive in the Scene window now gained a new section called <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window with three options available:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_17.jpg" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Select</strong></span> will select a prefab that this object belongs to in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> will reset all changes done to the object and make it identical to the prefab.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> will update the prefab with changes done to the object.</p></li></ul></div><p>Try creating more instances of the prefab in the Scene, manipulate the prefab and use object transform, add and remove components from the prefab and objects, and see how they affect each other.</p><p>You should figure out that all objects are immediately updated whenever the prefab is changed, but a change done to a single object doesn't affect the prefab itself, unless changes are committed via the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>If by any chance you forgot what you've changed in the object, there is no need to compare it to the prefab to find out; all changes will be highlighted in the Inspector window.</p></div><p>If you want to reset a particular component of an object from a prefab, you can do that by right-clicking on the component you wish to reset and select <span class="strong"><strong>Revert To Prefab</strong></span>. This will reset that particular component only and leave other components untouched.</p><p>Objects that are connected to their prefabs will also be highlighted in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window with a blue color.</p><p>One thing to be <a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a>cautious about is dragging and dropping an object onto a non-empty prefab, which will result in the replacement of all of its instances with the object you've dropped. This cannot be reverted with the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl+Z</em></span> command, but you will receive a warning message from Unity and can still cancel the action; so be wary.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_18.jpg" /></div><p>As a rule of thumb, it's a good precaution to set up all the objects to have their own prefabs, even if you aren't planning to mass modify them. There are two major reasons to do this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Meshes cannot be modified, nor do they have components attached to them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window. You can only do that by dragging the mesh into the Scene, which will automatically create a GameObject that you can then modify. Or, skip that and create a prefab editable in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>Programmers will have a much easier time working with cooked prefabs rather than manually assembling the required GameObject via code.</p></li></ol></div><p>That being said, you should probably go ahead and create prefabs for the <span class="strong"><strong>Bush_Model</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Rock_Model</strong></span> assets we've recently imported. We'll need them very soon.</p></div>
