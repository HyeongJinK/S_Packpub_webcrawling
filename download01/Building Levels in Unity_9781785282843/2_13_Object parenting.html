In Unity, it can be done by dragging and dropping the GameObjects on top of each other in the Project or Hierarchy window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_19.jpg" /></div><p>There is one thing to be aware of: it is important to understand that the transformation of the child is no longer relative to the global space, but to its parent object. So whenever the parent object moves, it will move all its children with it. This is also the case for scale and <a id="id108" class="indexterm"></a>rotation.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Parenting and prefabs</h3></div></div></div><p>When it comes to prefabs, parenting is<a id="id109" class="indexterm"></a> quite simple: You freely modify and add any children to the <a id="id110" class="indexterm"></a>parent object in the Hierarchy view and then hit <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> for them to be saved to the prefab. However, unparenting a child from a GameObject will cause the parent object to lose connection to the prefab.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_20.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>If you need to use unparenting you will have to lose connection to the prefab for that object, unparent, and then drag and drop it back onto the prefab. That will commit changes to all other references as well.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"></a>The pivot point</h3></div></div></div><p>Another important thing to know is how the<a id="id111" class="indexterm"></a> pivot point of the parent object is going to react to the addition of child objects. This is where the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot tool</strong></span> that we've discussed earlier comes in handy. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Center mode</strong></span>, it is located exactly in the middle of the group. However, switching to the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot mode</strong></span> will result in the pivot point snapping to the original position, where it was back when the parent object was exported (if it was).</p></div></div>
