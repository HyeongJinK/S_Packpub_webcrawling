However, it is highly recommended that you reserve your other foliage and environmental details that don't act like trees, for another tool that we will look into in the next topic.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_29.jpg" /></div><p>The customization options and uses of the Place Trees tool are very limited. Just like for other tools, we start with no objects in our palette and must add some to work with. For that, we go to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Trees…</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tree</strong></span>.</p><p>Now we can select a tree from the Object Picker from the new option window. Choose <span class="strong"><strong>Palm_Desktop</strong></span> from the imported Standard Package.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_30.jpg" /></div><p>In here, the <a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a>only option available to us is <span class="strong"><strong>Bend Factor</strong></span>. This parameter <a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a>will only appear/work if the selected tree was created with Unity Tree Creator—it adjusts tree responsiveness to the wind or how much the tree will bend if a Wind Zone exists in the scene (<span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Objects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Wind Zone</strong></span>). The <span class="strong"><strong>Palm_Desktop</strong></span> tree was created in SpeedTree app, so it does not have this parameter available for it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>Trees don't work with grouped objects. They will only use root GameObjects that have a Mesh Renderer component on them and ignore other objects down the hierarchy line.</p></div><p>Now that we have a tree in our palette, let's see what options are available to us:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_31.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Brush Size</strong></span> <a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a>controls the area size in which trees will be created and with <a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a>that increases the number of trees per stroke.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tree Density</strong></span> controls the number of trees we can place on a single unit of a terrain. This is very handy as it prevents us from drawing over the same patch of trees and unintentionally increase its density.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Height</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Width</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Color Variation</strong></span> parameters, which you will see later, make trees more varied in height, width, and color. This allows the creation of a more natural feel to the forest. <span class="strong"><strong>Color Variation</strong></span> shades some trees brighter and others darker. <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Height</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Width</strong></span> are very useful parameters as well (width scales along <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> axis).</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Lock Width to Height</strong></span> checkbox disables the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Width</strong></span> parameter and binds it to the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Height</strong></span> parameter.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Random</strong></span> checkbox next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Height</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Tree Width</strong></span> parameters will allow you to specify the range of tree scaling via a range slider (with <span class="strong"><strong>Random?</strong></span> checked) or choose fixed scaling for all trees with an inputted number (with <span class="strong"><strong>Random?</strong></span> unchecked).</p><p>Painting trees is very similar to anything else you've tried up to this point. The <span class="strong"><strong>Mass Place Trees</strong></span> button will take all imported trees and distribute them on the terrain. By pressing the button, you will be able to specify the number of trees you want to be placed. Unity will distribute that number of trees among all the trees in your palette, and will place them on the terrain.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_03_32.jpg" /></div><p>After placing trees, you <a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a>can hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key to erase them where you don't need <a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a>them, or hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> key to erase the selected tree type only.</p><p>Let's get back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Tree Collider</strong></span> parameter (that was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter) in the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Collider</strong></span> component. One of the common misconceptions about this parameter is that whenever it's checked, the trees will automatically get colliders. This is not so: only the trees that were created with a collider will have it activated. There could easily be thousands of trees in your level; calculating collision for all of them might be unnecessary and performance heavy. That's why you should keep track of those trees that have colliders and those that don't, and use them according to your needs. Otherwise, trees are well optimized in terms of performance thanks to the billboard technology they are based on; so you don't have to worry about having a lot of them in your scene.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>Whenever you modify your tree, do not forget to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Refresh</strong></span> button if you don't see the changes appearing on the screen.</p></div></div>
