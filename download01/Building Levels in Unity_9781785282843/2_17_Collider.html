<span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span>
<a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a> is a shell that is used to register physical interactions between objects; however, this will not prevent objects from moving into each other. Colliders are there to register collision, not to prevent it. To add a collider to an object, we need to add yet another component called <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> under <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>. The purpose of the collider is to register the collision between itself and objects controlled by physics and essentially to prevent your character from walking through walls and falling through the floor. Collider can be transformed manually by clicking <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Collider</strong></span> button and dragging its boundaries</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_36.jpg" /></div><p>You might have noticed <a id="id147" class="indexterm"></a>that there are a lot more colliders, but the <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> is the most commonly used one because of its simple geometry. Based on object topology and collision precision requirements, you might have to use multiple colliders by adding more collider components. The best results can be achieved by using <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span>, which will copy the topology of the assigned mesh reference. But it is also the most performance heavy Collider and might cause issues if overused on dynamic objects.</p></div>
