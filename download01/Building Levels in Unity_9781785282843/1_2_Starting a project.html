If you did, then by launching the program, you will be welcomed by the <span class="strong"><strong>Projects</strong></span> screen where all your future projects will be located. Right now it is empty, so let's add one to it by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> button at the top-right corner.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_01_01.jpg" /></div><p>This will open a new <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>window that will ask you to enter the name of your project and its location on the hard drive.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_01_02.jpg" /></div><p>I'm going to skip the fancy naming and go with <span class="strong"><strong>My Unity Project</strong></span> this time and leave the default <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span>. Make sure that you have the <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span> option selected, which will default our project to the 3D space and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span> button to proceed.</p><p>Don't worry about importing <a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a>packages at this point; we can always do that later. If you already have a project, creating a new one is done by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> in the top menu.</p></div>
