Before the release of Unity 4, it was the only way to work with animations in Unity; however, despite the fact that we now have a much more advanced and flexible Mecanim system, a lot of people are still using the old school version for its simplicity and ability to create custom animations within Unity. The sad news is that Unity developers confirmed that, over time, they will try to get rid of Legacy animation for good, and only keep it for the sake of backward compatibility. However, before that happens, Legacy Animation is the only tool that will allow you to create animations inside Unity.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look into the character import pipeline and also how to use Mecanim to set up animations.</p></div>
