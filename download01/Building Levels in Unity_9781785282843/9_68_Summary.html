It might seem a little confusing at first, but once you figure out what you need, it's easy to find which parameters to modify in order to achieve whatever effect you have in mind. The important part to remember is to modify one parameter at a time to avoid confusion.</p><p>Unity standard assets contain a good starting set of frequently used particle systems that you can use in your level or reverse engineer to figure out a way to create your own.</p><p>In the last chapter, we will look at more ways to enhance our level before publishing.</p></div>
