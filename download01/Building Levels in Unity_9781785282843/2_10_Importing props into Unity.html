There is one thing that you need to be wary of when importing a Blender file into Unity; your Blender version has to be 2.45 or higher. The reason for this is that Unity uses the Blender FBX exporter added to Blender in version 2.45. If you are using an older version of Blender, you need to manually convert your files to a common 3D file format before importing.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>This is not just the case with Blender. If your 3D app doesn't have a built-in exporter, Unity will not be able to read the native file format. That is also the reason why you need to have that 3D software installed on a computer in order to access imported assets.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec08"></a>Object setup before exporting</h4></div></div></div><p>In terms of the mesh, there<a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a> aren't any Unity specific requirements that need to be met to import successfully.</p><p>If the asset that you are importing has multiple components and/or groups, make sure to set them up properly in a 3D app, as it will have the same hierarchy when imported into Unity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_11.jpg" /></div><p>You cannot modify an asset or its hierarchy directly in Unity. Say you've imported a <code class="literal">.blend</code> file into Unity and wish to edit it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Double-click on the imported file in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>If you have Blender installed on your computer, Unity will opt to run it.</p></li><li><p>Edit the file and save it.</p></li><li><p>Return to the editor.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once you've returned to the Editor, you might experience a small lag; that's Unity reimporting the file you've just edited.</p><p>Make sure that there is a pivot point where you want it to be. Remember, in Unity, the default is a center pivot point, but you can switch it to the one set in the 3D app, by going into Pivot mode.</p><p>Make sure that you remove construction history—Nurbs, Norms, and Subdiv surfaces must be converted into polygons. During the final export, get rid of your scene lighting; it will not be exported.</p><p>There are a few tips<a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a> and tricks that you can apply in order to optimize your models, however, we will touch upon them later, after covering all related material.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>The importing process</h3></div></div></div><p>The easiest way to get<a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a> assets, is simply by dragging and dropping the <a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a>file into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window. It will create a copy of the file within the Unity directory. Alternatively, you can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset…</strong></span> in the top menu and import it that way.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785282843/graphics/B04214_02_12.jpg" /></div><p>Files will be automatically converted, so you don't have to change anything else.
