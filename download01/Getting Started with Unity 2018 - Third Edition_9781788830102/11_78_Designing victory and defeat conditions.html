In this section, we will design our game's victory <span>and</span><a id="id288601240" class="indexterm"></a> defeat conditions so that there is a clear goal or way to win the game.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing the Game</em></span>, we identified three end-of-game conditions: two ending in defeat for our Cucumber Man, and only one resulting in defeat for our Cucumber Beetles.</p><p>Here are the victory conditions for our game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Cucumber Beetles win if:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">There are no cucumbers left in the game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Cucumber Man runs out of lives</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Cucumber Man wins if:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">There are no Cucumber Beetles left in the game</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>These victory and defeat conditions are pretty simple, and there can only be one winner. If the Cucumber Beetles win, the Cucumber Man loses. </p><p>In order to implement these conditions, we need to track the following with our scripts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of cucumbers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Beetles</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Man lives remaining </li></ul></div><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch10">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Our Points System</em></span>, we wrote the necessary scripts to keep track of cucumbers and Cucumber Beetles. We also ensured the HUD is continuously updated with those counts. It is important for the player to have a sense of how they are doing in the game. Beyond just points, the player will want to continually review how many cucumbers and Cucumber Beetles there are in the game. The player will also want to know how many Cucumber Man lives remain. </p><p>In the next section, we will update our game so the number of lives are updated and the player's health bar is put into use. These will provide the player with much-needed visual components of the HUD during gameplay.</p></div>
