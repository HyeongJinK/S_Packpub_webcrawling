As you will remember from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing the Game</em></span>, we plan to incorporate the following game objects related to the terrain:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cherry trees</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cucumber patches</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cucumbers</li></ul></div><p>We will add those game objects in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating and Importing 3D Objects for Our Game</em></span>. For now, we can add some regular trees to start filling in our game environment.</p><p>Instead of simply importing trees that others have made, we will go through the steps to create our own trees. Follow these steps to create your first 3D tree in Unity from scratch:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Select <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>3D Object</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> from the top menu. This will create a new tree and place it in your game world at <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> 0, 0, 0. </li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip22"></a>Note</h3><p>Double-clicking an object in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel will focus it in the center of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view. It will also provide a zoomed-in view of the object.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Using the transform tools, increase the Y axis so the tree is above your water line. It will only consist of a single branch:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/12586c94-b3df-420b-b07b-9dfdc75877a9.png" /></div><p>With the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> selected, we turn our focus to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> window in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. The following diagram indicates the various buttons that we will be using to continue creating our tree:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/25cf6063-5218-49a7-beb3-c9fd40cf309e.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Select the Branch Group icon in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> window. Next, click the Add Branch Group button. You will see a branch has been added to the main Branch, which serves as a tree trunk. As you can see here, there is a <strong class="userinput"><code>Length</code></strong> setting that you can adjust in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/a269d3b7-fc8e-496d-be26-9e0eea890172.png" /></div><p>There are three additional tools that can help you make unique trees. The buttons, illustrated as follows, are Move Branch, Rotate Branch, and Free Hand:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/1f54d9d5-5edd-4272-b946-ec9cc916a235.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Continue to create branches on your tree trunk until it looks the way you want it to. Remember, you can individually move, resize, and rotate branches. You can also add branches to branches. When you add a new branch, it is added to the currently selected branch.
</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip23"></a>Note</h3><p>When you first create a new branch, it is best to change the size before moving it. Once you relocate the branch, you might lose the ability to make certain adjustments.</p></div><p>When you are done adding and configuring branches, your tree will look quite unique. An example is provided in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/3c553af4-03e1-435e-94d7-5cca70ac778e.png" /></div><p>As you can see, there is one tree trunk and several branches. We can see, in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> window, the hierarchy of branches:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/e7947e52-6f44-4844-8f1f-af1af48267d9.png" /></div><p>Your next step is to add leaves to your tree. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Click on the branch you want to apply leaves to and click the Add Leaf Group button. </li><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Distribution</code></strong> section of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Frequency</code></strong> to select how many leaves you want on that branch. This image shows the <strong class="userinput"><code>Frequency</code></strong> slider interface:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/32178c36-8d1c-42e6-89a8-b90f831b1612.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Continue adding leaves to the branches until you have your desired look. When you are done, your tree will look like it has paper for leaves: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/61f08902-aaf6-448c-918a-2ba28d337345.png" /></div><p>As you can see, there is one tree trunk with several branches and leaf groups. We can see this in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tree</code></strong> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/bc6778a5-9f06-4c51-8a60-f1245a0f4b87.png" /></div><p>The next step would be to apply <span>materials</span><a id="id288614498" class="indexterm"></a> to the branches and leaves. Since we do not have any of those materials in our game project yet, we will leave the tree as it is. Learning how to create unique trees can contribute to unique gaming environments. There are several quality trees available from Unity Technologies, as well as other content creators. We will explore some of those trees, and actually incorporate them into our game, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating and Importing 3D Objects for Our Game</em></span>.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel, rename the <code class="literal">Tree</code> to <code class="literal">Tree_Special</code>.</li><li>Using the transform tools, relocate the tree on dry land. It is not important where you put it, as long as it is on dry land and not on a spawn point.</li><li>With <code class="literal">Tree_Special</code> selected, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scale</code></strong> from <code class="literal">1, 1, 1</code> to <code class="literal">3, 3, 3.</code> That will make our tree more prominent in our game world.</li><li>Do not forget to save your Unity project.</li></ol></div></div>
