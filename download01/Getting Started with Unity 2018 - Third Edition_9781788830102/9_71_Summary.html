We used a canvas GameObject to create text and graphics that provide visual indicators of points, health, and additional information to help the player maintain situational awareness during gameplay. In addition to this, we wrote scripts to update key components of the HUD. We also implemented a mini-map using a Unity camera.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch10">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Our Points System</em></span>, we will design, script, and implement our game's point system. This will include providing frame-by-frame updates to key on-screen components of the game's HUD.</p><p> </p></div>
