The first release in 2005 introduced us to an excellent game engine that has been continually improved <span>upon</span><a id="id288608631" class="indexterm"></a> over the last decade with new features, support, and enhancements. With each new release, developers are presented with more functionality to help them develop stunning games.</p><p>Unity Technologies, the creators of Unity, is a well-established company dedicated to continual improvement of the game engine. As new processing technologies and platforms arise, Unity support will not be far behind. As with all Unity features, excellent official documentation accompanies all new functionality and features.</p><p>Being able to use a free version of the game engine without having to pay royalties is a game changer. Individuals, hobbyists, and small studios can make games using the same powerful game engine as large studios. In addition, the robust feature set and Unity community are additional factors that make Unity the right choice for your game development projects. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"></a>Unity features</h3></div></div></div><p>In this section, we will list the core features of the <span>Unity</span><a id="id288608692" class="indexterm"></a> game engine.
