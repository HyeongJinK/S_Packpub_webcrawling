<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec15"></a>Installing Unity</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In the previous section, you downloaded the Unity Installer. Locate that file, likely in your <code class="literal">downloads</code> folder, and launch the program. </p><p>For the remaining steps, and throughout this book, we will use Unity running on macOS. The steps and processes for installing and using <span>Unity</span><a id="id288345150" class="indexterm"></a> are the same for both systems; the interfaces might vary slightly in appearance.</p><p>Once you launch the Download Assistant, your computer might present you with a security prompt:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/7cd7ab3d-001a-47f3-9175-b20eb98f834e.png" /></div><p>Once you accept the security warning, and after clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Open</code></strong> button, you will see the <strong class="userinput"><code>Introduction</code></strong> pane. Click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Continue</code></strong> button.</p><p>Next, you will see the <strong class="userinput"><code>Software License Agreement</code></strong> pane (not shown here). You can read, print, and save the Software License Agreement. Click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Continue</code></strong> button to proceed. This will result in a popup asking you if you consent to the terms of the software license agreement. If you do agree, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Agree</code></strong> button.</p><p>The next step is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Unity component selection screen</code></strong>. By default, all components will be selected. You will see how much space is required for these components to be installed on your computer and how much space you have left. You can disable components you know you will not need right away and install them later. Alternatively, you can install all components if space is not an issue:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/1be6033f-12e5-4e22-bf56-ebc9842d20f4.png" /></div><p>In order to follow along with this book's tutorials, you will need to, at a minimum, select the following components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Unity 2017.1</code></strong> (or later version that is presented in the interface)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Standard Assets</code></strong></li></ul></div><p>In addition, the following components are highly recommended:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Documentation</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Example Project</code></strong></li></ul></div><p>Next, you will select an installation destination and click the <strong class="userinput"><code><span><strong class="userinput"><code>Continue</code></strong></span></code></strong> button.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Download Assistant</code></strong> will start downloading the components you previously identified (not shown here). If you have a slow internet connection, this could take a while.</p><p>This is a good time to create your free Unity ID. If you still have Unity open in your browser, you will see the person icon in the top-right of their page. If you do not see that icon, you can revisit <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com</a>. When you click on the icon, you will see a new interface with a <strong class="userinput"><code>Create a Unity ID</code></strong> button. Click that button and fill out the registration form:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/e4f3c22a-3aa0-4ffe-be20-d7648cba3648.png" /></div><p>You will need your account to use the Unity Asset Store, even for obtaining free content.</p><p>Once all components have been downloaded and installed, you will be notified by the Download Assistant.</p><p>When you first launch Unity, you will need to select a license. Unity is now successfully installed on your computer and you are ready to use it.</p></div>
