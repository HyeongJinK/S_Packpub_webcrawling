The first game character is the Cucumber Man, and will be controlled by the player. The second game character is the Cucumber Beetle. This is a non-player character that is controlled by artificial intelligence. Let's look more closely at both of these characters.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"></a>Cucumber Man</h3></div></div></div><p>The player will play our <span>game</span><a id="id288601252" class="indexterm"></a> as the Cucumber Man, our game's protagonist. This is a character that we will import for use in our game. It was created using Maya, a professional 3D modeling and animation software suite, and Photoshop. Here is a look at our Cucumber Man:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/7701ebb0-1290-4007-9432-13de111922df.png" /></div><p>So, what can the Cucumber Man player character do? We already know we will be able to move him throughout our game environment using a combination of keyboard and mouse inputs. We also know that the space bar <span>will</span><a id="id288601272" class="indexterm"></a> cause him to jump and that the left mouse button, our action button, will cause him to shoot cherries.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"></a>Note</h3><p>Because the Cucumber Man is controlled by the human player, it is referred to as the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span>.</p></div><p>We will implement the following animations for the Cucumber Man:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Idle</strong></span>: This will play when the character is not being moved by the player.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Walk</strong></span>: This is the animation that will play when the player causes the Cucumber Man to walk, regardless of direction.

We will control how many of them we want in our game and where they are placed. We will also control their behaviors through artificial intelligence. The Cucumber Beetle character was created using Maya and Photoshop, the same software pair used to create the Cucumber Man. Here is a look at our Cucumber Beetle:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/5709f306-e5c7-4b08-98d3-ff4391a86232.png" /></div><p>The Cucumber Beetles will search for and consume cucumbers. We will determine how long it takes a cucumber to be consumed. As you can see in the preceding illustration, there are images for the cucumber beetle in its normal state, with all six legs on the ground, and standing up. The stand-up position will be used when it is attacking the Cucumber Man.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>Because the Cucumber Beetle is controlled by artificial intelligence and not a human player, it is referred to as the <span class="strong"><strong>Non-Player</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span>.</p></div><p>We will implement the following animations for the Cucumber Beetles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">While on the ground:
