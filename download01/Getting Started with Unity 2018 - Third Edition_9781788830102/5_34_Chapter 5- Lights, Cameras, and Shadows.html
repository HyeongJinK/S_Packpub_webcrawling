We used shaping tools, painted the terrain, and added water. We even created our own tree from scratch. In addition, we created a material and imported a texture file.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore cameras and lighting in Unity. We will start with a look at cameras to include perspectives, frustums, and Skyboxes. Next, we will learn a few uses of multiple cameras to include mini-maps. We will also cover the different types of lighting, explore reflection probes, and conclude with a look at shadows.</p><p>Specifically, we will cover the following concepts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with cameras</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using multiple cameras</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with lighting</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing reflection probes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding shadows</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to use the same Unity project featured in this chapter, you can download the <code class="literal">Starting-Chapter-05.zip</code> file from the publisher's companion site.
