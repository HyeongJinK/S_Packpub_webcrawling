Both of these concepts are discussed in the sections that follow.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec117"></a>Level of detail</h3></div></div></div><p>Level of detail refers to how much detail is rendered on any given game object. The greater the number of polygons, the greater the level of detail your <span>game</span><a id="id288601252" class="indexterm"></a> objects will have. In order to reduce render times, you should consider what elements of detail need to be part of the 3D model and which ones can <span>simply</span><a id="id288601260" class="indexterm"></a> be included in the texture.</p><p>There are also <span class="strong"><strong>level of detail</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LOD</strong></span>) models. This is when you use multiple models of the same object in a game, each with a different level of detail. Think about a game where the player stands on the coast, looking at the horizon. A ship that is 12 miles away does not need the same level of detail as when it is just a few yards away. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec118"></a>Static colliders</h3></div></div></div><p>Static colliders are game objects with a <span>collider</span><a id="id288603847" class="indexterm"></a> but without a rigidbody. As the name suggests, these game objects do not move. Because the physics engine knows these objects will not move, pre-calculations can be made to make the game more efficient.</p><p>So, to increase efficiency, you should strive to use static colliders when possible.</p></div></div>
