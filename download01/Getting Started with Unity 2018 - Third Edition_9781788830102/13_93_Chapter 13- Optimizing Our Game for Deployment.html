Specifically, we added audio to key events in our combat system and added lighting and particle special effects. We started with an overview of Unity's audio system, then planned and implemented our game's audio. We then shifted to an introduction to lights and shadows in Unity and covered select special effects in Unity. We concluded by adding a point light to our cherry trees and a special effect to our spawn pads.</p><p>This chapter has two areas of focus: optimization and deployment. In the optimization sections, you will learn how to diagnose your Unity game for performance problems and how to optimize scripts and graphics rendering. In the deployment section, you will learn about the Unity build process, how to create a standalone player, and how to deploy your game to multiple platforms.</p><p>Specifically, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Profiler window</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing scripts</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing graphics rendering</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Additional optimizations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating builds </li></ul></div></div>
