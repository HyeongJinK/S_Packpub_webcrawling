In Unity, we refer to this as the <span>player</span><a id="id288345153" class="indexterm"></a> character. In order to have a player character, we need a controller. In our case, we will use a third-person controller. A third-person controller is a framework used to control a character from the perspective of a third-person camera.</p><p>The Unity standard asset package includes a <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController</code> asset package. The package, as you can see in the following screenshot, contains <code class="literal">Animation</code>, <code class="literal">Materials</code>, <code class="literal">Models</code>, <code class="literal">Scripts</code>, <code class="literal">Textures</code>, and <code class="literal">Prefabs</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/2ae715f0-07f6-4ecc-900e-77579a9398de.png" /></div><p>This section demonstrates how to use a character created by Unity. It will not be incorporated into the <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game. By going through the following steps, you will become familiar with the process of using the <code class="literal">ThirdPersonCharacter</code>provided by Unity:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Launch Unity.</li><li>From the top menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Assets</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Import Package</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Characters</code></strong>. </li><li>You will be presented with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Import Unity Package</code></strong> dialog window. Click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Import</code></strong> button.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel, you will see <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code>. Navigate to <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Characters</code></strong> | <code class="literal">ThirdPersonCharacter</code> | <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> and drag the <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController</code> prefab to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel. </li><li>Double-click on the <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController</code> in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel to autofocus on the controller in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view. As shown in the following screenshot, the character is encased in a capsule controller: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/77c11622-af30-47d6-a61a-0290cd07174a.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>In the hierarchy pane, drag the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> so that it is subordinate to the <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController</code>. This is required so that the camera follows the player character during gameplay.
</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view, use the transform tools to position the camera above and behind the character. With the camera selected, your <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera Preview</code></strong> window, in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view, should look similar to the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/86bd7e2a-0ca8-4b3d-9b9b-f3ab178e0c7a.png" /></div><p>Now you can put the game into game-mode and navigate the game world using your keyboard and mouse. As you will see, the default character can move around the world, and the camera will follow.</p><p>Using the provided <code class="literal">ThirdPersonController</code> is great for testing purposes, but you would not want to deploy a game using these standard assets. Although Unity Technologies permits commercial use of their standard assets, using them erodes the uniqueness of your game, so it is recommended that they only be used for testing.</p></div>
