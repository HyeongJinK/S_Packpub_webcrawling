We significantly reconfigured the non-player character's animation controller. We also planned and wrote scripts to control the non-player character's in-game behaviors, which included patrolling, cucumber consumption, fighting on the ground, and fighting on hind legs. In addition, we added cucumber patches, cucumbers, and cherries to our game world.</p><p>In this chapter, we will design, develop, and incorporate a <span class="strong"><strong>Heads-Up Display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>) in our game. We will use a canvas to create text and graphics <span>that</span><a id="id288345143" class="indexterm"></a> provide visual indicators of points, health, and additional information to help the player maintain situational awareness during gameplay. We will also implement a mini-map using a Unity camera.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Designing our HUD</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with a canvas</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a mini-map</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scripting for dynamic content</li></ul></div></div>
