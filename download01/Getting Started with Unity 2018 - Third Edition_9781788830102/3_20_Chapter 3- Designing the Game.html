Becoming familiar with Unity's interface gives us the confidence to move forward with the game engine and to explore additional interface components as we introduce new functionality necessary to create our game.</p><p>In this chapter we will design our game, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span>, so that we can create a development plan. Our game design will include all the functionality we want in our game, the player character, the non-player characters, game assets, animations, and more. We will use screen mock-ups, as well as narrative, to document our game's design. We will look at related concepts regarding using Unity for our game along the way.</p><p>Specifically, we will examine the following concepts in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game concept</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game characters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Gameplay</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The difficulty balance</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Project organization</li></ul></div></div>
