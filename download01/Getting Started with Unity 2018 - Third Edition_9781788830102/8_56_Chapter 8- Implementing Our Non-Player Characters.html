We imported the character, reviewed the controls, examined the animations, and made the necessary configuration changes to fully use our character in the game. We reviewed the player character's animations and the character's animation controller. We also identified scripts relevant to the player character and reviewed several of them. In addition, we made modifications to our game's terrain to better accommodate the player character during gameplay.</p><p>In this chapter, we will focus on the non-player characters. Our Cucumber Beetles will serve as our game's non-player characters and will be the Cucumber Man's enemies. We will incorporate Cucumber Beetles in our game through direct placement. We will review the beetles' 11 animations and make changes to the non-player character's animation controller. In addition, we will write scripts to control the non-player characters. We will also add cucumber patches, cucumbers, and cherries to our game world.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the non-player characters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing the non-player characters into our game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Animating our non-player characters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Incorporating the non-player characters into our game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Terraforming the terrain for our Cucumber Beetles</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding cucumber patches to our terrain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding cucumbers to our terrain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scripting our non-player characters</li></ul></div></div>
