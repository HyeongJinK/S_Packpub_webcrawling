It supports 3D spatial sound, which provides a surround-sound effect. This gives our audio source a point and dimension. There are also extensive mixing and mastering capabilities in Unity.</p><p>In this section, we will explore the basics of audio in Unity and take a look at the Audio Mixer.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec101"></a>Unity audio basics</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity supports several <span>audio</span><a id="id288608692" class="indexterm"></a> effects, including the <strong class="userinput"><code>Duck Volume</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Effect</code></strong>, which allows us to manipulate an audio signal's volume.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"></a>Note</h3><p>The term <code class="literal">duck</code> refers to making the audio signal quieter.</p></div><p>We can use a variety of audio formats in Unity. You can see the four formats listed here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Audio Interchange File Format</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AIFF</strong></span>) </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">MP3</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OGG</strong></span>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">WAV</li></ul></div><p>If you have audio assets that are in a file format different from these four, you can probably use a free audio conversion tool to change the file format.</p><p>When we import an audio file into a Unity game, the file becomes an audio clip. Audio clips can also be created from within Unity by using your computer's microphone. You can even create audio clips via scripts during your game.</p><p>In Unity, audio sources are attached to objects. These audio sources emit, or play, sound and audio listener components do receive the sound emitted by audio sources. You can think of audio listeners as the player's ears inside the game world, hearing what's near them. Usually, one audio listener component is attached to the main camera so that the sounds it picks up on align well with what is displayed in the game view. Listeners are also attached to objects. Let's look at an example to see how a GameObject, an audio source, and listeners are related.</p><p>Let's say we are creating a zoo simulation and are working on the bovine section. There is a holding area for cows. Cows are generally quiet, but might be noisy eaters. The cow would be our GameObject and it would emit a <span class="emphasis"><em>chewing</em></span> audio clip. The audio clip's RAW file (that is, <code class="literal">chewing.aiff</code>) would be identified as an audio source component attached to the cow GameObject. Now, let's say there is a farmer character. We can attach a listener to the farmer, which is also an object. That listener is a script that performs certain actions if it hears the sound from the cow. Perhaps, if the listener picks up the <span class="emphasis"><em>chewing</em></span> sound, they will know that more hay is needed.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the various components:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/5135541d-e0a9-4b13-bafa-08d7b5df66a0.png" /></div><p>You will learn how to use these components later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec102"></a>Unity's Audio Mixer</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity's <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> gives you the ability to mix and master <span>audio</span><a id="id288612518" class="indexterm"></a> sources and effects. To access the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong>, you select <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> from the pull-down menu, and then select <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong>.</p><p>When you first open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window, you will see that there are no mixers in your project. As you can see in the following screenshot, there is a <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> icon on the far-right side of that window: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/a4d76441-eaae-4049-85ac-abbf2884a48c.png" /></div><p>Clicking that icon enables you to create a mixer.</p><p>When you have a mixer in your project, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window reveals four sections on the left. As shown in the following screenshot, these are <strong class="userinput"><code>Mixers</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Snapshots</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Groups</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Views</code></strong>. All the mixers in your project will be listed here. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Snapshots</code></strong> are a collection of parameters that you can use in your mixer. An <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer Group</code></strong> can be used to modify audio source sounds prior to them reaching the listeners. The final section is <strong class="userinput"><code>Views</code></strong>. A <strong class="userinput"><code>View</code></strong> is just a saved state of the mixer groups:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/7024f99b-90b1-4461-8e95-735509deba3e.png" /></div><p>To the right of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Mixer</code></strong> window, you see a single mixer in our project. When you click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button, you will see a popup, shown here, that reveals several options: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/5ca34d17-8a70-4b32-9713-2bd0457ce35e.png" /></div><p>We will not use these options in our game, but they are worth exploring if you intend to implement advanced audio effects in your game.</p></div></div>
