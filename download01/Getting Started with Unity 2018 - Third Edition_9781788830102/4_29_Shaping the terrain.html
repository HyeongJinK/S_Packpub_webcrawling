We will start with smoothing, and then create our five spawn points.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec46"></a>Smoothing our terrain</h3></div></div></div><p>As we identified in the previous section, our <span>terrain</span><a id="id288601252" class="indexterm"></a> currently has some bumpy edges and pointed peaks. We will use the smoothing tool, which is available in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Terrain</code></strong> section of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. As you can see here, it is the third icon from the left:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/f5234a05-5f8e-4e35-9a2a-3e9983ed234e.png" /></div><p>When the smoothing tool is selected, you are presented with different brush types and sizes. Once you make those selections, simply use the left-button of the mouse to smooth the terrain.Â </p><p>The following screenshot shows the results of the terrain after significant smoothing has been applied:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/206834b0-7c50-4772-ae97-f87848192b07.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are following along with these steps in Unity, your results will vary and that is okay. The exact terrain construction is not required in order to follow along with the remaining steps in this and other chapters.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec47"></a>Creating our spawn points</h3></div></div></div><p>Our game design called for five <span>spawn</span><a id="id288603868" class="indexterm"></a> points: one in the center, and one each in four corners. Our game environment is not a perfect square, so we will create a spawn point in the center of our terrain and four additional spawn points throughout the terrain.</p><p>We are not scripting the spawning yet; that will take place in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Victory and Defeat</em></span>. For now, we will simply create <span>the</span><a id="id288606790" class="indexterm"></a> areas using terrain-shaping tools. Specifically, we will use the <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Paint Height</code></strong></strong></span> tool. As you can see here, it is the second icon in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Terrain</code></strong> section of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/48b21c2e-824d-43b6-8c5a-93dc1bee1724.png" /></div><p>Selecting the a <strong class="userinput"><code>Brush Size</code></strong> of <code class="literal">25</code>, we simply click and paint the five areas where we want the spawn points to be. We will use the one in the center as the default starting point at the beginning of the game, and then randomly select one of the five for spawning in-game.</p><p>When making the spawn points, we want them to be elevated, but not too high. The following screenshot shows the five spawn points located throughout the terrain:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/b97c2dba-f429-440b-8d74-18d3c7afd86a.png" /></div></div></div>
