You can use <span>one</span><a id="id288345145" class="indexterm"></a> of the predefined layouts of <strong class="userinput"><code>2 by 3</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>4 Split</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Tall</code></strong>, or <strong class="userinput"><code>Wide</code></strong>, or you can create your own. Layouts refer to how the various views in Unity are arranged on the screen. </p><p>To change a layout, we simply click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Layout</code></strong> button that is located in the far top-right corner of the Unity interface. Let's look at each layout to see the differences.</p><p>The first layout is the <strong class="userinput"><code>2 by 3</code></strong> layout. This layout provides a nice arrangement with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> views on the left, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> views in the middle and a full <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> view on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/8acbfbb0-6ccf-4cb8-abd2-566c2eceb009.png" /></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>4 Split</code></strong> layout provides four different views of the same scene, as shown in the following screenshot. This is a good way to review how lighting and shading is implemented in your game. We'll talk about lighting and shading later in the book. The <strong class="userinput"><code>4 Split</code></strong> layout is shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/a53fea4f-fc4d-4512-94f8-bd47855a5b8b.png" /></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Tall</code></strong> layout provides a tall, but not wide, view of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view with other views located on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/1b54018f-c072-4bd6-bab7-c0a33515f75e.png" /></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Wide</code></strong> layout provides a wide view of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view, with other views located on the bottom and on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/bae80bf1-c75f-449a-98ca-ff90d2e237db.png" /></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Default</code></strong> layout is a variation of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Wide</code></strong> layout. The difference is that with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Default</code></strong> layout, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> view is on the left, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/3318f38e-5772-4643-b572-005a09bb02af.png" /></div><p>You can switch between layouts any time you want, without it impacting your game. Most Unity developers do not work in just one layout. Different layouts provide different benefits and are appropriate for different tasks. You can also modify any layout by dragging any of the borders of a view or window. If you want to save a layout, make any changes to the current layout, then select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Layout</code></strong> button and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Save Layout</code></strong>. You will be prompted for a name.</p></div>
