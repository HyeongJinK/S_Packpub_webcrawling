We imported and used several assets. We added trees and other objects to our scene. We created 3D objects using Unity's native modeling tools and imported assets from the Unity Asset Store, as well as from the publisher's companion site. Specifically, we added our game's Cherry Trees, and prepared areas for Cucumber Patches. </p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementing Our Player Character</em></span>, we will incorporate our game's player character, the Cucumber Man. We will import the character, review the controls, examine the animations, and make the necessary configuration changes to fully use our character in the game. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to start testing the game.</p></div>
