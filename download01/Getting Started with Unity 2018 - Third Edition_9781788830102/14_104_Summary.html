We started with a quick introduction to virtual reality, including hardware requirements, and then looked at how to create a virtual reality game using the Unity game engine. We also took a look at the available starter content from the Unity Asset Store.</p><p>Having read this book, you will have the ability to create your own dynamic games using Unity and you will have an idea of what is required to start making virtual reality games. You are getting started at a good time: virtual reality is still a very young technology. For example, t<span>he human</span> eye requires approximately 16,000 x 16,000 pixels per eye for a photographic-quality virtual reality experience, but best current VR displays provide up to 1080 x 780. So we have a long way to go with this technology, and its future is <span>promising.</span></p></div>
