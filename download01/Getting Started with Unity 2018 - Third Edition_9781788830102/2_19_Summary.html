This included the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> views. We also looked at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> windows. We then reviewed the various layouts as well as the toolbar. Lastly, we established that additional interface components will be covered in subsequent chapters as new functionality and tools are introduced.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will start designing our <span class="emphasis"><em>3D Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game. This design will inform our development of the game throughout the rest of the book. </p></div>
