So far we <span>have</span><a id="id288345145" class="indexterm"></a> identified and detailed our planned use of the Cucumber Man, our player characters, and the Cucumber Beetles, our non-player character. We will also use cherry trees, cherries, and cucumber patches. Let's briefly look at those in the next section, <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom assets</em></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec41"></a>Custom assets</h3></div></div></div><p>Several custom assets <span>have</span><a id="id288603846" class="indexterm"></a> been created using Maya and Photoshop for use in our game. The first set of assets are two forms of cucumber patches, both shown in the <span>following</span> image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/ce680319-a8ce-4823-bc3c-49d0934fc31f.png" /></div><p>We will use these cucumber patches to cover large sections of our game environment, as identified earlier in this chapter. We have two different patch formations to help create an authentic and non-repetitive look to the game environment. We will also rotate the patches to add variability to the overall visual appearance of the ground covering.</p><p>A custom cucumber will also be provided in our game. While there might be hundreds of them in the game, we will use one base cucumber, pictured here, and replicate it throughout the game environment. We can modify the size and rotation to ensure we have what will appear to be a lot of unique cucumbers:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/ae95a9cb-0e51-419e-b577-e94cf6a735ef.png" /></div><p>Our next custom asset is a cherry tree. Our base tree is shown here and has a unique form. We can alter the size and rotation of this tree to create the visual of a bunch of unique trees. Certainly this is not an authentic cherry tree, but it will be suitable for our purposes:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/9cdec552-9c25-4441-87e5-32e94fea18bc.png" /></div><p>Although our cherry trees have cherries on them, they are all part of the tree and not separate objects. So, our player character can collect cherries from the cherry trees, but there will be no visual indication that the cherries have been picked. We will update our HUD to provide that indication. For throwing cherries at Cucumber Beetles, we will use the cherry shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/7b10d944-0b8b-4e6f-bfd7-9bad95ad785a.png" /></div><p> </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec42"></a>Standard assets</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the custom <span>assets</span><a id="id288608689" class="indexterm"></a> created for this game, we will use many of Unity's standard assets including textures, materials, and 3D objects. We will start using textures and materials in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Our Terrain</em></span>. We will create our own 3D assets using Unity's native tools, as well as importing additional ones in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating and Importing 3D Object for Our Game</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec43"></a>Organization</h3></div></div></div><p>If we do not have a plan to be organized, our project can quickly get out of hand. Unity has great search support for project components, but we <span>would</span><a id="id288608721" class="indexterm"></a> rather be able to quickly navigate to our assets. Here is the basic structure that we will make as we start creating our game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/3bdadd57-80c9-44e9-82e0-a1192b1f01f5.png" /></div></div></div>
