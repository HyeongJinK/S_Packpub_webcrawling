We used shaping tools, painted the terrain, added water, and even created our own tree from scratch. In addition, we created a material and imported a texture file.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>,Â <span class="emphasis"><em>Lights, Cameras, and Shadows</em></span>, we will explore the different types of lighting and cameras available in Unity. We will use lights and cameras in our <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game to achieve appropriate light and shadow effects for the game.</p></div>
