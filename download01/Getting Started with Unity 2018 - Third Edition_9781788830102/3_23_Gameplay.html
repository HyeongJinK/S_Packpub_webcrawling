The Cucumber Man, controlled by the player, will need to defend the cucumber patches from the Cucumber Beetles. To fend off the Cucumber Beetles, the Cucumber Man <span>will</span><a id="id288345145" class="indexterm"></a> need to collect cherries from nearby cherry trees. The goal is to defeat all the Cucumber Beetles before the cucumbers in the cucumber patches are all gone. </p><p>Let's look at how we will make all this happen. The following game play components are covered in this section:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game world layout</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Starting condition</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Point system</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Heads-Up Display</li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec35"></a>Game world layout</h3></div></div></div><p>Will will create our game world in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Our Terrain</em></span>, and then add cameras and lighting effects in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Lights, Cameras, and Shadows</em></span>. We will create a basic outdoor environment that consists of a large island surrounded by water. The water will be for aesthetics and boundary purposes. We will not make use of the water; after all, cucumbers cannot swim.</p><p>Here is a mock-up of the shape our game world will take:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/a40311bf-08ca-4075-a90d-dfc724b60804.png" /></div><p>There are four basic things illustrated in the preceding mock-up:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span>: This will just be used for our game world border.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Spawn Points</strong></span>: There are five spawn points, and we can randomly spawn our player character to one after losing a life.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cherry Trees</strong></span>: We will place four sizeable clumps of cherry trees in the game world.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cucumber Patches</strong></span>: These are not labeled in the mock-up, but are represented by the green scribbled areas. This represents the rough approximation of where the vast cucumber patches will be planted or, in our Unity terminology, placed. </li></ul></div><p>The only item not represented in our mock-up is the placement of the Cucumber Beetles. We will place the beetles somewhat randomly through scripting. We will do that in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Implementing Our Non-Player Characters</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec36"></a>Starting condition</h3></div></div></div><p>When our game is first launched, we <span>will</span><a id="id288612577" class="indexterm"></a> have several starting conditions set. Here is a list of those conditions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cucumber Man spawn point</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number and placement of Cucumber Beetles</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of cherries held by Cucumber Man</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number and placement of <span>cucumbers</span></li></ul></div><p>Let's look at each of these starting conditions.</p><p>The first starting condition is where to spawn the Cucumber Man. As you saw in our earlier mock-up, there will be five possible spawn points in the game. We will write a script to spawn the player in a random spot each time. While there are only five spots, it does add enough randomness into the game to make this a fun and challenging component.</p><p>The number and placement of Cucumber Beetles is the second starting condition. This is an important pair of decisions to make. If we decide poorly, the game is likely to be too easy or too hard and, in both of these situations, the game would not be challenging enough to make it fun to play. We will look at this issue in greater detail in the section titled <span class="emphasis"><em>The difficulty balance</em></span> later in this chapter. </p><p>The number of cherries held by the Cucumber Man is our third starting condition. The Cucumber Man will start with zero cherries and, each time he is respawned, he will also have zero cherries. So, if the Cucumber Man has 319 cherries and is defeated by one or more Cucumber Beetles, the Cucumber Man will respawn with zero cherries, losing the 319 cherries he had.</p><p>Our fourth and final starting condition is the number and placement of cucumbers. This is an important set of considerations, and is tied to the placement and number of Cucumber Beetles. We will examine the possibilities and the likely outcomes of our decisions regarding this issue in the section titled <span class="emphasis"><em>The difficulty balance</em></span> later in this chapter. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec37"></a>Point system</h3></div></div></div><p>So far, we have established that we would track several components in the game. These are listed here along with the variable name that we <span>will</span><a id="id288614178" class="indexterm"></a> use in our scripts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Beetles:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">numberOfCucumberBeetles</code></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of cucumbers:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">numberOfCucumbers</code></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Man lives:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">livesLeft</code></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Based on what we decided earlier regarding the end-of-game condition, we can apply the following mathematical checks to determine if the game has ended and what the outcome is. Each end-of-game condition is listed in the following table along with the outcome:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Condition number</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>End-of-game condition</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Outcome</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><code class="literal">numberOfCucumbers == 0</code></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Beetles Win</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>2</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><code class="literal">numberOfCucumberBeetles == 0</code></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Wins</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>3</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><code class="literal">livesLeft == 0</code></p></td><td style=""><p>Cucumber Beetles Win</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>In order to implement the three end-of-game conditions, we know we have to track the number of beetles, cucumbers, and lives. This is not optional. Where we do have flexibility is with what we display to the user. We will make that decision in the next section, <span class="emphasis"><em>Heads-Up Display</em></span>.</p><p>Since we are tracking key information that involves numbers, it makes it easy for us to implement a point system. We could, for example, give the player 50 points each time a Cucumber Beetle is exterminated. We could also take away points each time a Cucumber Beetle takes a bite out of the Cucumber Man.</p><p>The point system that we will implement in our <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game will consist of two types of events, those that result in points being added and those resulting in points being subtracted. Here is a table with the details of our point system:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>In-game event</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Points</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Start of Game</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+ 1,500 </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Picks Cherry</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+ 5</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Hits Cucumber Beetle with Cherry on the Ground</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+ 10</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Exterminates Cucumber Beetle on the Ground</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+ 25</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Hits Standing Cucumber Beetle with Cherry</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+ 50</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Exterminates Standing Cucumber Beetle </p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>+100</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Loses Life</p></td><td style=""><p>- 500</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>As you can see from the preceding table, we will start our player with 1,500 points and subtract 500 each time a life is lost. This will ensure we do not have a negative point total, and is one less thing for us to check in our scripts. This also gives players a bonus for each life they save.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec38"></a>Heads-Up Display</h3></div></div></div><p>We have decided to keep track of information during gameplay that has value beyond calculating points and the end of game.

So, we <span>will</span><a id="id288614668" class="indexterm"></a> create a Heads-Up Display for the player, and dynamically update the data in the game.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>Heads-Up Display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>) is a visual layer of information that is always present on the screen.</p></div><p>Here is a mock-up of what our <span class="strong"><strong>Heads-Up Display</strong></span> will look like in our <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/3d646ba9-a322-47de-aa02-f37403cd2ee4.png" /></div><p>As you can see, there are six components to our HUD.
