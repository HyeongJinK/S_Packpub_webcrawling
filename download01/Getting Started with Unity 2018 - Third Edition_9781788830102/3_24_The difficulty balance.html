If it is too difficult, players <span>will</span><a id="id288601238" class="indexterm"></a> lose interest, and if the game is too easy, it might not appeal to your intended audience. Some games include difficulty levels for users to select from. Other games have multiple levels, each with an increasing level of difficulty. There are several questions that we must contend with in order to achieve our desired difficulty balance.</p><p>In this section, we will first look at the difficulty balance questions, followed by our implementation plan.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec39"></a>Difficulty balance questions</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a lot of questions about our game that we need to consider in our game design. A review of the questions in this section <span>will</span><a id="id288601255" class="indexterm"></a> help us gain an appreciation for the issues that even a simple game such as ours must contend with to achieve the desired difficulty balance.</p><p>This first set of questions are related to the overall implementation of difficulty in our game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Should we have different levels of difficulty, selectable by the player?

Here are a couple of questions for each of those game assets that we will implement in our game.</p><p>Cucumbers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How many bites should it take for a cucumber beetle to consume a cucumber?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How many cucumbers should there be in the game?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Where should the cucumbers be located in the game environment?</li></ul></div><p>Cherries:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">At what pace should the player be able to gather cherries?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">What will be the maximum number of cherries the Cucumber Man can have?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How much damage will the cherries inflict on the Cucumber Beetles?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How many cherries will be available in the game?</li></ul></div><p>As you can see, there are several questions that we need to answer as part of our design. Some of the questions may seem redundant as they relate to more than one component in the game. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec40"></a>Implementation plan</h3></div></div></div><p>Based on the questions posed in the last section, we must come up with some answers. So, let's do that here. This set of answers <span>will</span><a id="id288606845" class="indexterm"></a> serve as the implementation plan for our difficulty balance. </p><p>Our first set of decisions focuses on the overall game concept. Here are those decisions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implement one game level.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Provide the user with three game difficulty settings. Setting names are provided here:

(Most difficult)</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Now that we've decided to create three game levels, we must determine how they will be different. This is easily managed by using a matrix. As we fill in the matrix, we will be able to document answers to most of the previously listed questions. Here is what we will refer to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>Difficulty Implementation Matrix</em></span>:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>I'm a Baby Cucumber</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>I Can Handle This</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bring It!</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Number of Cucumber Beetles</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * 2</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * 5</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Damage from Cucumber Beetles (to Cucumber Man)</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>-5 health points per second</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>-10 health points per second</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>-20 health points per second</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Damage from Cucumber Beetles (to Cucumbers)</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>-5 points per second</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>-7 points per second</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>- 9 points per second</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Beatle Starting Health</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * 2</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * 5</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Man Starting Health</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * .75</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * .5</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cucumber Starting Health</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>300</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>400</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>500</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Number of Cucumbers</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * .75</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * .5</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Cherry Gathering Rate</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1 cherry per second</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1 cherry every 2 seconds</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>1 cherry every 3 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Maximum Number of Cherries Held by Cucumber Man</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>99</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>75</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Damage from Cherry (to Cucumber Beetles)</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>X * .75</p></td><td style=""><p>X *.50</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>There will also be a set of decisions that will not change based on the user-selected difficulty level.
