This included providing frame-by-frame updates to key on-screen components of the game's HUD. Our scripts enabled the collection of cherries from cherry trees, adding the cherry-throwing capability for our Cucumber Man. We also added points based on the collection of cherries and combat hits.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Victory and Defeat</em></span>, we will design and script our game's victory and defeat conditions. This will include managing the Cucumber Man's health, lives remaining, and respawning the player character.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
