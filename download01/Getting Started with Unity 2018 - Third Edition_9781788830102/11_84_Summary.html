We updated our game's scripts to manage the Cucumber Man's health, including updating the HUD's health bar. We implemented our victory and end-of-game logic through scripting. We also implemented the lives remaining and the onscreen indicators of those lives. Lastly, we scripted the respawning of our player character.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will plan and implement audio and visual effects in our game to help enhance overall game play. Specifically, we will add audio to key events in our combat system and add several special effects using Unity's particle system to add to the game's visual appeal.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
