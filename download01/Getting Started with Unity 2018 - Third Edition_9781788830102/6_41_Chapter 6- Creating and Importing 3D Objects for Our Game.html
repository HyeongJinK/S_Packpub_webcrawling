We started by looking at cameras, as well as the concepts of perspectives, frustums, and skyboxes. Next, we learned the possible uses of multiple cameras in Unity games. We also covered the different types of lighting, explored reflection probes, and concluded with a look at shadows.</p><p>We are ready to start making our game environment more robust. We will do that by adding trees and other objects to our scene. In this chapter, we will create 3D objects using Unity's native modeling tools. We will also import and use assets from two sources. Our first source will be the Unity Asset Store where we will download free-to-use assets for our game. We will also import 3D assets prepared specifically for our <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game. As we obtain the assets, we will incorporate them into the game project and watch our game start to take shape.</p><p>We will cover the following concepts in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding assets and GameObjects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating 3D objects in Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Unity Asset Store</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Incorporating custom assets in our game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with imported assets</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to use the same Unity project featured in this chapter, you can download the <code class="literal">Starting-Chapter-06.zip</code> file from the publisher's companion site. Once you download the file, decompress it, and then open the project in Unity. It contains the completed work from the previous chapters.</p></div></div>
