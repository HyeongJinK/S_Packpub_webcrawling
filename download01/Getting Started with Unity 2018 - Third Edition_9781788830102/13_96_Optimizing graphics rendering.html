Each of these concepts are covered in the following sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec114"></a>Occlusion culling</h3></div></div></div><p>Cameras are a critical game object in our Unity games. They allow the player to see the game environment. Unity works diligently <span>during</span><a id="id288603863" class="indexterm"></a> gameplay to render objects within a camera's frustum. Graphics rendering can represent a tremendous performance issue. It is therefore important that we pay special attention to our camera's occlusion cullingparameter. When enabled, Unity will not render objects that are occluded, or not seen by the camera. An example would be objects inside a building. If the camera can currently only see the external walls of the building, then none of the objects inside those walls can be seen. So, it makes sense to not render those. We only want to render what is absolutely necessary to help ensure our game has smooth <span>gameplay</span> and no lag. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec115"></a>Lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>When we create our scenes in Unity, we have three options for lighting. We can use real-time dynamic light, the baked lighting approach, or a mixture of real-time and baked. Our games perform more efficiently with baked lighting compared to real-time dynamic lighting, so if performance is a concern, try using baked lighting where you can.</p><p>Area lights are distinct from the other types of light in that they can only be baked. This means that real-time rendering will not take place <span>during</span><a id="id288603885" class="indexterm"></a> gameplay. The reason for this is to conduct all the processing regarding area lights prior to gameplay. This processing, if accomplished in a game in real time, would likely result in sufficient lag. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec116"></a>Mesh renderer</h3></div></div></div><p>The mesh renderercomponent of a <span>game</span><a id="id288606803" class="indexterm"></a> object can be viewed in the Inspector panel. There are multiple settings that can be adjusted to enhance performance.</p><p>The Cast Shadowssetting can be set to On, Off, Two-Sided, or Shadows Only. The default is On, so you should disable this for all objects that do not need to cast shadows. </p><p>The receive shadowsis a toggle that tells Unity whether you want that object to receive shadows or not. As you would expect, this takes extra processing to display during the game. So, if you do not need an object to receive shadows, deselect this for greater performance.</p></div></div>
