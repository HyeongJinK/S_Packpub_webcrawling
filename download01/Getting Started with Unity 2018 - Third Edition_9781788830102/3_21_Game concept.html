<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec27"></a>Game concept</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Why design our game, why not just start developing it? This question spawns from the excitement of developing games, especially with the Unity game engine. All games start with an idea. That idea is translated into a design, and that <span>design</span><a id="id288345145" class="indexterm"></a> is the basis for development and, eventually, the final game.</p><p>A game's design is like a blueprint for a house. You would not consider building a house without a blueprint, and it is an equally bad idea to develop a game without designing it first. The reason for this is to save time and frustration. For larger projects, time wasted also means unnecessary funds were expended. Imagine that you employed a project team of twelve developers, animators, and artists. If you shared your game idea, would they have enough to go on? Would they do great things, but not have a cohesive set of components for your game? All we are doing with our game design is documenting as much as we can in the beginning so that the development process is purposeful. Without question, you will continually modify your game's design during development, so having a strong base to start from is critical to your success.</p><p>Our game design will serve as the foundation for the look of our game, what the player's objectives are, what the gameplay will be, supporting user actions, animations, audio, artificial intelligence, and victory conditions. That is a lot to think about, and underscores the importance of translating the game idea into a game design.</p><p>Throughout the book we will be covering a range of components, however, in this section, we will cover those which are listed beneath:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game idea </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Input controls </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Winning and losing </li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"></a>Game idea</h3></div></div></div><p>The basic concept of our <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game is that it will be a 3D game featuring a Cucumber Man as the player character. The <span>character</span><a id="id288608728" class="indexterm"></a> must protect the cucumber patches, fighting off Cucumber Beetles. These beetles are intent on destroying the cucumber patches and anyone that gets in their way, including our Cucumber Man. </p><p>The Cucumber Man will harvest cherries from cherry trees and throw them at the Cucumber Beetles. This will be the only form of defense our Cucumber Man has against the Cucumber Beetles, except for running away.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"></a>Input controls</h3></div></div></div><p>It is important to consider <span>how</span><a id="id288610498" class="indexterm"></a> players will interact with our game. The player will control the Cucumber Man using the standard set of controls. Players have an expectation that the industry norms for user controls will be implemented in games. So our default set of user input control, as shown here, will consist of the keyboard and mouse:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/aed2958b-a295-4e06-9582-4e9a0a734435.png" /></div><p>We will configure and program our game so that user input from the keyboard matches the key and action pairings in the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Keyboard input</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Action</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Up arrow</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move forward/up</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Down arrow</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move back/down</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Left arrow</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move left</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Right arrow</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move right</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move forward/up</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move back/down</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move left </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Move right</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Space bar</p></td><td style=""><p>Jump</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>The mouse will also be a significant source of user input. We will implement two components using the mouse as indicated in the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Mouse input</strong></span></p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Action</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Mouse movement</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Rotate character</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Left button</p></td><td style=""><p>Throw cherry</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>The left mouse button will be our action button. We will need to ensure cherries are thrown only when the player has one or more cherries remaining.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>Winning and losing</h3></div></div></div><p>Our winning condition will be <span>when</span><a id="id288614241" class="indexterm"></a> all the Cucumber Beetles have been eliminated. There will be two different ways the player can lose the game. The first losing condition is when all the cucumbers have been eaten by the Cucumber Beetles.  The second losing condition is if the player runs out of lives. </p><p>By this short description, you can tell there will be several things to keep track of, including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Beetles</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of cucumbers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Number of Cucumber Man lives</li></ul></div></div></div>
