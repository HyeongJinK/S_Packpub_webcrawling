<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec41"></a>Working with lighting</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In the previous sections, we explored the <span>uses</span><a id="id288345145" class="indexterm"></a> of cameras for Unity games. Just like in the real world, cameras need lights to show us objects. In Unity games, we use multiple lights to illuminate the game environment.</p><p>In Unity, we have both dynamic lighting techniques as well as light baking options for better performance. We can add numerous light sources throughout our scenes and selectively enable or disable an object's ability to cast or receive shadows. This level of specificity gives us tremendous opportunity to create realistic game scenes.</p><p>Perhaps the secret behind Unity's ability to so realistically render light and shadows is that Unity models the actual behavior of lights and shadows. Real-time global illumination gives us the ability to instantiate multiple lights in each scene, each with the ability to directly or indirectly impact objects in the scene that are within range of the light sources.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip26"></a>Note</h3><p>Indirect light refers to lights bouncing off objects and reflecting on other objects.</p></div><p>We can also add and manipulate ambient light in our game scenes. This is often done with Skyboxes, a tri-colored gradient, or even a single color. Each new scene in Unity has default ambient lighting, which we can control by editing the values in the the <strong class="userinput"><code>Lighting</code></strong> window. In that window, you have access to the following settings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Environment</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Real-time Lighting</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Mixed Lighting</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Lightmapping Settings</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Other Settings</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Debug Settings</code></strong></li></ul></div><p>No changes to these are required for our game at this time. We have already set the environmental lighting to our Skybox. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch12">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding Audio and Visual Effects to Our Game</em></span>, we will look at <strong class="userinput"><code>Fog</code></strong>, which is available under the <strong class="userinput"><code>Other Settings</code></strong> section of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Lighting</code></strong> window.</p><p>When we create our scenes in Unity, we have three options for lighting. We can use real-time dynamic light, use the baked lighting approach, or use a mixture of the two. Our games perform more efficiently with baked lighting, compared to real-time dynamic lighting, so if performance is a concern, try using baked lighting where you can.</p><p>In addition to ambient lighting, there are four types of light: directional, point, spot, and area. We will look at each of these in the following sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec52"></a>Directional lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>When we create a <span>new</span><a id="id288614228" class="indexterm"></a> scene in Unity, a directional <span>light</span><a id="id288614236" class="indexterm"></a> is automatically created for us. This emphasizes the importance of directional lights. This type of light provides illumination in a specific direction. Using transform tools, we have full control over the direction of these lights. </p><p>An example of directional lighting is generating sunlight in our scenes. Although the light from directional lights is similar to that of the sun, there is no actual sun-like object that the light comes from. As shown in the following screenshot, <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Lights</code></strong>, when selected, indicate the direction of its illumination with yellow rays:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/9044bb7e-7416-4b55-b60c-ade750d3e1d9.png" /></div><p>One of the great aspects of using directional lighting is that illumination strength is not dependent on an object's distance from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong> object. This type of lighting defines the direction of the light, and distance has no impact on the illumination. </p><p>With a <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong> selected, you have access to several parameters in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. In addition to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> section, there is a <strong class="userinput"><code>Light</code></strong> section where you can change several settings to include the light color and intensity. The remaining parameters are worth exploring and no changes are required to complete our game.</p><p>To add additional directional lights, you would select, from the top menu, <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Light</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong>.</p><p>For the <span class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber Beetle</em></span> game, we will keep the default <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong>. You can use the transform tools to modify the location, rotation, and light direction. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec53"></a>Point lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>Point lights get their <span>name</span><a id="id288614307" class="indexterm"></a> from the fact that <span>they</span><a id="id288614315" class="indexterm"></a> are lights sources emanating from a specific point. These light objects, as indicated in the following diagram, emit light in all directions:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/09b6faa1-119b-465f-8acf-8435680f5987.png" /></div><p>These lights are typically used to simulate fireballs or light bulbs. They can also be used to simulate some magic or special lighting effects. As you can see in the following screenshot, point lights have several properties that affect how they impact the game environment:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/d0213840-566b-4078-9484-2d78dcf57699.png" /></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Range</code></strong> is the distance between the center of the light to the outside arc of the light. We can also change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Color</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Intensity</code></strong> to produce the results we desire.</p><p>To create a point light, we select <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Light</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code> Light</code></strong> from the top menu.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec54"></a>Spot lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>Spot lights are <span>another</span><a id="id288614376" class="indexterm"></a> type of lighting in Unity. They <span>are</span><a id="id288614385" class="indexterm"></a> meant to provide lighting on a specific spots. Common examples are flashlights and vehicle headlights. As you can see from the following screenshot, the light originates from the source in an outward cone shape:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/6a3a0384-395d-4fd5-9468-975a49777ab6.png" /></div><p>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel, we can change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Range</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Spot Angle</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Color</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Intensity</code></strong>. <strong class="userinput"><code>Range</code></strong>, in this context, refers to the distance between the light source and the furthest point in the cone. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Spot Angle</code></strong> is the angle of the outward exterior edge of the cone shape. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Spot Angle</code></strong> range is 1-179°. The larger the value is, the larger the cone face will be.</p><p>To create a spotlight, we select <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Light</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Spot Light </code></strong>from the top menu.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"></a>Area lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>To use an <strong class="userinput"><code>area light</code></strong>, we <span>define</span><a id="id288614451" class="indexterm"></a> a rectangle using the transform tools or the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel. Area lights emit light from one side of their rectangle. The following screenshot shows what an area light object looks like in the Unity editor:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/412afce7-0584-48ca-9844-3b0a09db67bd.png" /></div><p>Area lights are unique from the other types of light as they can only be baked. This means that real-time rendering will not take place during gameplay. The reason for this is to conduct all the processing regarding area lights prior to gameplay. This processing, if accomplished in real time in a game, would likely result in sufficient lag.</p><p>As you can see in the following screenshot, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Type</code></strong> is set as <strong class="userinput"><code>Area (baked only)</code></strong> and cannot be changed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/36d8fb3d-75aa-4dd1-b8f2-c816462fe69c.png" /></div><p>Area lights can be used instead of point lights when baked lighting is okay and you desire software shadows.</p><p>To create an area light, we select <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Light</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Area Light </code></strong>from the top menu.</p></div></div>
