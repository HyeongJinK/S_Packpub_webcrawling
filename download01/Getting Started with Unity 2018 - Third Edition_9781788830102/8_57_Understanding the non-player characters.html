These <span>characters</span><a id="id288601230" class="indexterm"></a> are controlled through scripts, and their behaviors are usually responsive to in-game conditions.</p><p>Our game's non-player characters are the Cucumber Beetles. These beetles, as depicted in the following screenshot, have six legs that they can walk on; under special circumstances, they can also walk on their hind legs:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/69473e3d-7ae2-4348-8891-db2eb68c6c28.png" /></div><p>Cucumber Beetles are real insects, and are a threat to cucumbers. They cannot really walk on their hind legs, but they can in our game. </p><p>In the next section, you will import a Cucumber Beetle asset package prepared specifically for this game. There will only be one beetle in that asset package. We will, through scripting, make multiple copies of the beetle. </p><p>Before you move on to the next section, you should open your Unity game project. Alternatively, you can download the<code class="literal">Starting-Chapter-08</code> Unity project available from the publisher's companion site.</p></div>
