We will examine each of these in subsequent sections. As you will quickly learn, this interface is customizable. The following screenshot shows the default configuration of the Unity user interface.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788830102/graphics/0461548d-1157-4b65-a951-44b298ec54fe.png" /></div><p>Overview of the Unity game engine user interface.</p><p>In the next sections, we will cover each of the following components indicated by the preceding screenshot:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Menu</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scene view</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game view</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Project window</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Hierarchy window</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Inspector window</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Toolbar</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Layouts</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>Unity 2017 was the latest release when this book was published, so the screenshots reflect the Unity 2017 interfaces.
