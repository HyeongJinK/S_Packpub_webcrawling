We reviewed the beetles' 11 animations and made changes to the non-player characters' animation controller. In addition, we wrote scripts to control the non-player characters. Our scripts resulted in several beetle behaviors: patrolling, cucumber consumption, fighting on the ground, and, when hit by a cherry, standing, running, and attacking on hind legs. We also added cucumber patches, cucumbers, and cherries to our game world.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>,Â <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding a Heads-Up Display</em></span>, we will design, develop, and incorporate a <span class="strong"><strong>Heads-Up Display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>) in our game. We will create text and graphics that provide visual indicators of points, health, and additional information to help the player maintain situational awareness during gameplay.</p></div>
