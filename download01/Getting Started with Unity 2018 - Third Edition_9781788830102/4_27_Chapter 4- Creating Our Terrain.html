We designed all the game's functionality, how to use the player character, what role the non-player character will have, what assets we will use, and what animations we will use in the game. We also mocked-up the main game screen as well as our heads-up display. In addition to this, we made key decisions on our game's difficulty balance. With the design work complete, we are ready to start creating our game. </p><p>In this chapter, we will create our game's terrain and perform several actions to customize the terrain based on our design mock-up in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing the Game</em></span>. We will use shaping tools and add water and vegetation features to complete our game environment.</p><p>Specifically, we will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating the terrain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Shaping the terrain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Painting the terrain</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding water</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding vegetation</li></ul></div></div>
