The new UI system is truly awesome and (more importantly for a lot of developers on a shoestring budget) it's free.</p><p>As we start to look forward to the new UI system, it is very important to understand the legacy GUI system (which still exists for backwards compatibility) and all it has to offer, so you can fully understand just how powerful and useful the new system is. It's crucial to have this understanding, especially since most tutorials will still speak of the legacy GUI system (so you know what on earth they are talking about).</p><p>With an understanding of the legacy system, you will then peer over the diving board and walk through a 10,000-foot view of the new system, so you get a feel of what to expect from the rest of this book.</p><p>The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A look back into what legacy Unity GUI is</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tips, tricks, and an understanding of legacy GUI and what it has done for us</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A high level overview of the new UI features</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>
