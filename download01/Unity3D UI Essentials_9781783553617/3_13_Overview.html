You can even use another component called the <span class="strong"><strong>Selectable</strong></span> component, that can be <a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a>added to just about any other GameObject (on a Canvas) to enable user interaction.</p><p>Enough preamble, let's play.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note72"></a>Note</h3><p>Note: If you draw a <a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>RectTransform</strong></span> with a negative width or negative height, then UI controls will not be drawn. You can rotate the control in whichever direction you wish to alter how it is drawn in the scene (including reversed, as UI controls are two-sided textures) but the base <span class="strong"><strong>RectTransform</strong></span> must always be drawn in a positive direction.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"></a>A word on code</h3></div></div></div><p>Starting simple, we'll just <a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a>play around with the controls in this chapter through the editor, with some code where it adds value to explain things.</p><p>We'll delve into building and using the controls through code in later chapters, including building controls with the event interfaces.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note73"></a>Note</h3><p>It's also worth noting a bit of best practice with project setup (something I went into in great depth in my previous book). To keep things clean and organized in the sample project accompanying this book, each type of object in the project is organized into its own folder, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scenes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Sprites</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scripts</p></li></ul></div><p>That way you can always find what you need and know where it will be.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"></a>Setting up the project</h3></div></div></div><p>As with the previous <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>chapters, you can either set up a new project to test the following examples or keep using the same project (or even use the sample project contained in the code download).</p><p>If you are setting up a new project, it can be either 2D or 3D (it makes no difference to the UI system).</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip23"></a>Tip</h3><p>However, if you are setting up in 3D, remember that images will be imported as <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span> by default, so you will need to change them to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span> after importing them.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec35"></a>A warning on the built-in images</h3></div></div></div><p>Throughout this <a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a>chapter, we will refer to the selection of built-in images thatcome bundled with Unity and are used as the default image for a lot of the UI control templates.</p><p>At the time of writing, these images are bundled as separate images and not on a combined spritesheet. Because they are separate images, they will need separate draw calls per control/image to render them to the screen.</p><p>If you use your own images and batch them together in a single spritesheet, your UI screen will be a lot more performant and use fewer draw calls.</p></div></div>
