Sure, we can throw a bunch of controls at the screen and arrange them here and there, but what happens when the screen resizes, the perspective changes, or it's run by someone with an 80 inch screen; what happens to our UI then?</p><p>With game development, we usually take this into account with our game world, just shrink and/or resize it to fit the device. The same cannot be said however for our UI. Text can become unreadable, and buttons may become too small or too big or even become unusable. There truly isn't one size that fits all, or is there?</p><p>Through the new Anchoring system in Unity UI, we can finally build a dynamic and responsive design that will look like the way we want it to, no matter the resolution it is displayed in. This is then complemented very well with a scaling component that slots straight onto our Canvases.</p><p>The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Positioning</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Anchors</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scaling UI with the Canvas Scaler</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building a responsive health bar</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Attempting to sail our ship through dangerous waters</p></li></ul></div></div>
