Go create! Think up weird and wacky ideas that are not just flat or information; throw stuff in your game world like never before and go wild.</p><p>The Unity 5 preview presentation on UI (<a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/U5Preview" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/U5Preview</a> at about the 1-minute mark) showed some other excellent examples of using these Canvas modes, including using a <span class="strong"><strong>World Space Canvas</strong></span> attached to a block that pops up a conversation window aligned to the object in the game (not the player as I've shown here). The UI system it shows is actually from 4.6 that has been ported to U5, so everything you see is possible today.</p><p>Unity really listened to customer feedback when creating all these options with the new <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> system, and these modes really deliver on the dream of a full 3D-embedded <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> without the hacks.</p><p>In this chapter, we covered the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI and 3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Added a <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space â€“ Camera</strong></span> Canvas and played with perspective</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Added a <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> Canvas and played with 3D placement</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Tips and tricks to use both the Canvas modes; no more flat stuff</p></li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will bring the title to a close and start to delve deep into the coding side, building <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> through code, and delve into the open source code (and get it running) and what secrets it uncovers.</p><p>The fact that Unity has published the new UI system source using an open source license is beyond amazing and gives you, the developer, the power to create whatever you want using actual real-world examples of Unity code as the base. If you are feeling really adventurous, submit your ideas to Unity and see whether they make it back into the core product itself!</p><p>At this point I'd really urge to use what you have learned this far and rip into the Official Unity UI examples.</p><p>With everything I have shown you, you should be able to understand how all the parts of the demo fit together. It also has some good examples of interactive UI screens (such as a keyboard) and a working example of a Drag and Drop system (although you will need to look at the code section in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with the UI Source</em></span>, to understand the scripts attached to the Drag and Drop demo).</p><p>The Official Unity UI demo sample can be found here <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/UnityOfficialUIExamples" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/UnityOfficialUIExamples</a> and has several scenes, each showing a different UI pattern.</p><p>I will also be following up on my blog with more samples and UI layouts, so keep an eye out!</p></div>
