With the ever-increasing fragmentation of screen real estate on mobile devices (even Apple is at it now with multiple sizes of devices). It is more important than ever to get your UI working in a true multi-platform fashion across all devices rather than making specific ones for each resolution.</p><p>This evolution of a new layout system is certainly a breath of fresh air and welcome departure from the legacy, programmatic only, legacy GUI system.</p><p>Not sure whether I managed to keep up with the whole nautical theme, but I gave it a good try!</p><p>In this chapter, we covered the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Positioning UI with Anchors</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with UI through multiple resolutions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Handling UI scaling</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with the Canvas Scaler</p></li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will take things up a notch. So far, we have just looked at painting a single canvas and drawing it full screen; however, the Canvas component is capable of so much more. So let's turn up the heat and start having some real fun with our UI.</p><p>We'll also add a living, breathing 3D scene and dunk our UI in it, like a nice hot-brewed cup of tea with a lovely rich tea biscuit <span class="emphasis"><em>Mr. Arthur Dent</em></span>. Now rest back on your towel and let us begin (bit of a Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy rift there).</p></div>
