</p><p>For the Slider, Unity provides by default:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A grouping parent GameObject for the slider, with the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> component attached</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> for the entire control (unlike the <span class="strong"><strong>Toggle</strong></span>, which was just the checkbox area)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An empty GameObject used to provide a <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> area for the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> bar, with a child <a id="id449" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> to fill the area using a default built-in sprite, the area is filled based on the <span class="strong"><strong>Value</strong></span> property of the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An empty GameObject used to provide a Rect Transform area for the sliding handle and a child <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> to denote the <span class="strong"><strong>Handle</strong></span> itself</p></li></ul></div><p>As we look to the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> control itself, we see that these two lower child elements are the key parts of the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span>. However, their parent is just as important as it provides the bounds of how far the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> can travel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_26.jpg" /></div><p>Again, we see the familiar base controls of the <span class="strong"><strong>Selectable</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>UnityEvent</strong></span> controls, this time it is the <span class="strong"><strong>On Vaue Changed</strong></span> event but with a data type of single (basically a float).</p><p>If we look deeper into the properties of the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span>, we can see the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fill Rect</strong></span>: This provides the graphical range for the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> control, it translates the <span class="strong"><strong>Min</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> values into graphical components on the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. This is also Selectable to <a id="id450" class="indexterm"></a>allow the user to jump to a position in the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> range.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Handle Rect</strong></span>: This <a id="id451" class="indexterm"></a>provides the grabble handle for the user to drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> through its range and also provides input to the <span class="strong"><strong>Fill Rect</strong></span> for range calculations.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Direction</strong></span>: This <a id="id452" class="indexterm"></a>allows you to define the default direction of travel for the slider in either horizontal or vertical directions (no diagonal sadly, but you can always rotate the control J), giving you <span class="emphasis"><em>left to right</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>right to left</em></span> options for example.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note107"></a>Note</h3><p>Note: You will have to resize the control if you want to switch from horizontal to vertical and vice-versa.</p><p>You don't rotate the control to switch from horizontal to vertical as it messes with the settings the control uses to render the control.</p></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Min</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Values</strong></span>: This is the minimum and maximum values the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> can range <a id="id453" class="indexterm"></a>to, nothing more, nothing less.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Whole Numbers</strong></span>: Given the base data type of the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> is a <code class="literal">float</code>, it allows for fine incremental <a id="id454" class="indexterm"></a>changes. However, there are those situations where you only need whole numbers or steps. Setting this option will cause the handle and the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span> value to jump up in increments, say for selecting pages/tabs on a form.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Value</strong></span>: The all-important <a id="id455" class="indexterm"></a>default value for the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span>, restricted to the <span class="strong"><strong>Min</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> values you have set previously.</p></li></ul></div><p>And that's all she wrote, there really isn't anything more fancy about the <span class="strong"><strong>Slider</strong></span>, it just does exactly what it says <a id="id456" class="indexterm"></a>on the tin. As with the other controls/components, you aren't restricted by Unity's default layout (the images don't even need to be visible), go wild and see what options you can come up with, slip slide away.</p></div>
