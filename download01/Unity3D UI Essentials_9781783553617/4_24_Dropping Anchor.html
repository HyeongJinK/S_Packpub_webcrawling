I say parent because an <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> can be set against the borders of any parent UI GameObject, not just a Canvas.</p><p>Clicking on the top-left graphic also reveals the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor Presets</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>Common Configurations</strong></span> as Unity likes to refer to them), as you can see here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_04_02.jpg" /></div><p>These <a id="id478" class="indexterm"></a>Presets provide a quick and easy way to apply the most common patterns to bind your UI within the Canvas. However, you are not limited in any way because you can also manipulate the Anchors whichever way you want to create your desired effect or the UI layout.</p><p>When we look at the scene view, we also see the editor handles for the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> that depict where in the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> space the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> points are bound to (these being the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_04_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The Anchor handles</p></div></div><p>So what does it all mean? What do these darn Anchor things actually do? We'll cover these with an example in its use and by the end, hopefully, you'll get the picture.</p></div>
