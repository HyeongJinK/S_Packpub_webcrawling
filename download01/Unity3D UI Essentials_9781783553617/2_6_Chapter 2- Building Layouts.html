In a breath of fresh air, <span class="strong"><strong>Unity UI</strong></span> has appeared to aid the weary UI developer, who just wants their UI their own way.</p><p>We start with the beginnings of Unity UI and the foundations that it builds upon, most notably the Sprite 2D system that was introduced with Unity 4.3. However, <span class="strong"><strong>Unity UI</strong></span> takes these simple beginnings and takes a bold leap forward. Almost every underlying part of the new sprite system has been improved and stretched to build something that is sensible and just works. In those areas, where it does not stretch enough, there is a base framework for extensibility; don't like it the way Unity has put it together, then do it your own way.</p><p>The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The new Rect Transform</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Unity UI canvas</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Layout and grouping systems</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity Events and the new EventSystem</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"></a>Note</h3><p>This chapter focuses on the fundamental framework and layouts behind the new UI system and as such doesn't cover the individual controls themselves. The controls will be covered in greater depth in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Control, Control, You Must Learn Control</em></span>.</p><p>First we need to understand the sandbox before you can start building stuff in it.</p></div></div>
