This isn't the first time they have made things public; back in October 2014, Unity released their Unit Test <a id="id683" class="indexterm"></a>Tools and a bunch of examples on their new public account (check them all out at <a class="ulink" href="https://Bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies" target="_blank">https://Bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies</a>).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note167"></a>Note</h3><p>Note: This section assumes you have either Visual Studio (2012+ express/community, pro, or ultimate), MonoDevelop, or Xamarin Studio installed to build and edit code. By default, you should already have MonoDevelop installed when you installed Unity.</p><p>You can browse the code all you like on the website, but to build/use it on your machine you will need a code editor and code build engine.</p></div><p>This is however, the first time they have released a core part of the Unity Engine for all to see (there have been a few other side projects but this is the biggest so far), to break it apart and even replace it in your own installs. Not only that, they are welcoming developers to review their code and suggest fixes/updates (within one week there were already 74 copies/forks of the new UI system); the world has become a very interesting place indeed.</p><p>Granted not everything is in there, the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> for example is a core engine component with specific rendering code so that isn't exposed, however, almost everything else is there to tinker with.</p><p>In this section, we'll walk over the repository itself (if you are not yet familiar with it), how you get access to the code, make changes, and even submit your suggestions.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note168"></a>Note</h3><p>Note: If you <a id="id684" class="indexterm"></a>do find a bug and are unsure how to resolve it, then you should still use the Unity Bug Tracker built into Unity (<span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Report a bug</strong></span>) or pop along to the Unity UI forum located at <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.unity3d.com/forums/unity-ui.60" target="_blank">http://forum.unity3d.com/forums/unity-ui.60</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec76"></a>The repository</h3></div></div></div><p>As the code repository is <a id="id685" class="indexterm"></a>completely open to the public, getting access to it is very simple.

Here are a few possible options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Atlassian SourceTree</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/</a>): This is a nice graphical client <a id="id695" class="indexterm"></a>that is available for most operating systems</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tortoise HG</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://tortoisehg.Bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">http://tortoisehg.Bitbucket.org/</a>): This is my preferred <a id="id696" class="indexterm"></a>client as it integrates tightly with Windows Explorer and offers several GUI management screens</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note174"></a>Note</h3><p>There are many other <a id="id697" class="indexterm"></a>Mercurial clients for various operating systems that you can find on the Mercurial site at <a class="ulink" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/OtherTools" target="_blank">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/OtherTools</a>.</p></div><p>Bitbucket themselves (oddly enough since they make it) recommend SourceTree; you'll find links peppered around the website and they also offer integration with all projects hosted on Bitbucket.

If you find something that is breaking or you don't know how to fix it, then use the standard Unity bug reporter (<span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Report a bug</strong></span>) to submit it. Don't submit a change with some notes saying it's broken because it will likely not be picked up by anyone.</p></div><p>Now to submit fixes or new features, you need to keep a few things in mind if you want it to be accepted (this is true for any open source project):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Keep it small</strong></span>: Do this as large submissions will likely be ignored.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Keep it succinct</strong></span>: Stay on target and fix one thing or add one feature at a time.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Document where possible</strong></span>: This will help moderators who read the code understand it quicker and easier.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Plan ahead</strong></span>: If you have a number of changes, either ensure they don't overlap/depend on each other or work with the moderators to ensure they are aware of what's coming. There is nothing worse than having a whole plan of work not accepted because it was too much or not what was wanted.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the road to submission, we start from grass roots, which means you start planning for the change before you even start coding. The basic workflow is like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new branch and keep the name simple and about your change.</p></li><li><p>Add your changes in one go or in a few commits/check-ins (too many commits in a request are bad).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note184"></a>Note</h3><p>Commits are when you are done making changes, then you use your source control tool to mark a checkpoint in your coding and then push/upload them to the server.</p></div></li><li><p>Commit your change to your branch.</p></li><li><p>Submit a Pull Request (PR) from your repository back to the main branch of the parent repository.</p></li><li><p>Monitor the request and answer queries.</p></li><li><p>If necessary update your development branch in your repository in answer to queries/requests.</p></li><li><p>Commit your fixes (no need to create a new PR, it will automatically be updated).</p></li><li><p>Once accepted, delete your development branch.</p></li><li><p>Refresh your repository from the parent.</p></li></ol></div><p>Bitbucket has all this information to hand on their site, so check it regularly for updates.</p><p>If you have already made your changes to your own repository (some developers to have a playground where they test things), then do not fret. Simply create a new branch in your source code application <a id="id713" class="indexterm"></a>from the last <span class="strong"><strong>Commit</strong></span> point by Unity, then follow the previous steps and copy your change in.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip58"></a>Tip</h3><p>It's quite normal to have a playground/sandbox area in your own repository; just be sure to start from a new branch in your local project before doing anything and above all else, keep the main development branch (the one from Unity) clean. <span class="emphasis"><em>Do not commit directly to the unity main branch.</em></span>
</p><p>Always use a new/clean branch of your own, or things will get muddled.</p></div><p>Happy coding!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note185"></a>Note</h3><p>A last note about submitting changes in the current process. Unity won't actually accept your change directly into their repository. The pattern currently being followed is that Unity will review your change and if it's deemed worthy they will copy your fixes/changes into their own code servers for consumption.</p><p>So they aren't using the source control in a normal fashion; they're just using it for people to highlight what they can easily fix/include. This may change over time as Unity get better working with Bitbucket.</p></div></div></div>
