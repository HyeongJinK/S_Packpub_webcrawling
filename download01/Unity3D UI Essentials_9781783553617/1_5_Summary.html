One thing you might realize is that there is no one stop shop when it comes to Unity; each feature has its pros and cons and each has its uses. There may still be cases when it is just easier to use the Unity legacy GUI to achieve an effect (still using the basic <code class="literal">GUI.DrawTexture</code> for a splash screen for example, although even that is very easy with the new UI system) provided you take the performance concerns on board with mobile devices. It all comes down to what you want to achieve and the way you want to achieve it; never dismiss anything just because it's old (except for <code class="literal">GUIText</code> and <code class="literal">GUITexture</code>, they are just really really oldâ€¦)</p><p>In this chapter, we covered the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The history of Unity legacy GUI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Detailed walkthrough of the legacy Unity GUI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Whistlestop tour of the new <span class="strong"><strong>Unity UI</strong></span> system and what we can expect from this title</p></li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will start with the underlying framework and guts behind the new GUI system, namely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The new <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> control (not just for Unity UI)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The new <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component (and why it's great)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span> control</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What Unity have done for scaling and resolution for UIs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The all new and improved Event messaging system for the Unity UI system, complete with new shiny raycasting features and helpers</p></li></ul></div><p>It promises to be a fun ride, and once we are through that, then in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Control, Control, You Must Learn Control</em></span> we can move on to actually building some UI and then placing it in your game scenes in weird and wonderful ways.</p><p>Now stop reading this and turn the page already!!</p></div>
