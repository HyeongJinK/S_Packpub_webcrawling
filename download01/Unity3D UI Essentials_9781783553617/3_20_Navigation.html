Selectable's are only navigated between each other using direction keys (up, down, left, and right); there is no Control order to tab through. You could of course write your own system (for which there is an example in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with the UI Source</em></span>
).</p></div><p>As we have seen in many of the inspector screenshots earlier in this chapter, most controls come with built-in <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> behavior properties including a button called <span class="strong"><strong>Visualize</strong></span> to view the navigation in the editor, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_29.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note112"></a>Note</h3><p>Note: <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> features are limited to those <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> controls that implement the <span class="strong"><strong>Selectable</strong></span> component, be it the built-in controls such as buttons, sliders, toggles, and so on, or those controls you build yourself.</p></div><p>By default (automatic), Unity will navigate from control to control by its nearest neighbor in the direction the <a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a>user navigates (up/down/left/right); if we align controls vertically and horizontally, this would produce the following navigation pattern:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_30.jpg" /></div><p>With each movement moving to the next control in that direction, if we rearrange the controls in a cross style pattern, then this nearest neighbor pattern becomes a little more obvious:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_31.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, Unity does a good job of ensuring navigation flows unilaterally between each control; if you want a little more control, however, there are a few other <a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a>options using the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span> selection:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span>: (shown <a id="id468" class="indexterm"></a>above)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal</strong></span>: This <a id="id469" class="indexterm"></a>limits the navigation to only left and right as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_32.jpg" /></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vertical</strong></span>: This <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>limits the navigation to an up/down movement as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_33.jpg" /></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Explicit</strong></span>: If none <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>of the automatic options really take your fancy and your control setup is a little bit more bizzare, for situations such as this there is the <span class="strong"><strong>Explicit</strong></span> option. This basically allows you to specifically select which control will be navigated to, based on the direction selected by the layer. If you look at the inspector, you can see this is very easy to configure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553617/graphics/3617OS_03_34.jpg" /></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Just point <a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a>each direction at the <span class="strong"><strong>Selectable UI</strong></span> control that you want, which is completely optional, you don't have to configure a direction if you don't want to.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span>: Nothing, absolutely <a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a>nothing, do nothing ever, nothing works. You get the picture, navigation is disabled.</p></li></ul></div></div>
