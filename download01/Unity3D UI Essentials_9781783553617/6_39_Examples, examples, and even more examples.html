</p></div><p>At the time of writing, the following examples were found:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>UI Window Base</strong></span>: This example started its life on the Unity forums and was enhanced/updated <a id="id677" class="indexterm"></a>and rewritten several times before I finally grabbed the best of all the changes into one final script. Its main goal is to add, drag, and drop support to any UI component. Additionally, this script now works with all types of Canvases, <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space – Overlay</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space – Camera</strong></span>, and even <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> Canvases.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Curved Text</strong></span>: This <a id="id678" class="indexterm"></a>script still amazes me for both its simplicity and effectiveness. Add this to any <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component and watch your Text bend over a programmable curve, complete with intensity (careful, Intensity 1 is very strong, so you might want to use something more like 0.06!). This shows the power of being able to modify the vertex data of a UI graphics component.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gradient</strong></span>: This is <a id="id679" class="indexterm"></a>another script from the same author as the Curved Text script, yet again, it's brilliant in its implementation. Simply put, add this to any component that provides vertex data and it will allow you to apply a color gradient to it. It's just fun to play with and breaks down how it works very clearly.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tab Navigation</strong></span>: This is a <a id="id680" class="indexterm"></a>simple, yet welcome extension for anyone who needs to have forms in their title. Simply put, use <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> to go to the next field and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>+</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> to go to the previous field.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>RaycastMask</strong></span>: This is <a id="id681" class="indexterm"></a>an essential script especially if you have round or complex-shaped graphics. It ensures that raycast events only fire when the cursor is actually over your sprite not just the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>. This gives a more accurate and finer test if you need something more granular (such as individual image pixels) than just a box.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>More to come, keep an eye on the repository!</p></li></ul></div></div>
