Back in the assets you downloaded from the publisher's website, look for the folder labeled <code class="literal">Player</code> in the <code class="literal">Art</code> directory. Inside the <code class="literal">Texture</code> folder in your project, create a new folder called <code class="literal">Player</code> and import the image named <code class="literal">playerSpriteSheet.png</code> to that folder.</p><p>This image is what is referred to, obviously, as a <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>sprite sheet</strong></span>, or a <a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>sprite atlas</strong></span>. Essentially, it's just a collection of images; however, rather than <a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a>each individual image taking up space in memory, all of those images only take up one image in memory. If that isn't clear, think of it like this: imagine you are hosting a holiday dinner. You could have every ingredient you are cooking within a separate fridge or every ingredient you are cooking all neatly organized in one fridge. The first option will overload your home with boxes—it is the same idea here with video memory and sprite sheets/atlases.</p><p>Say you already have a collection of sprites and need to turn them into a sprite sheet. You could build that by hand in a tool such as Photoshop; however, that gets somewhat tedious. There are some tools that can automatically build sprite sheets—check out Shoebox<a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a> and <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>Texture Packer.</p><p>So, even though we can clearly see that this image is a sprite sheet, we need to let Unity know. To do this, select <span class="strong"><strong>playerSpriteSheet</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and look over at the inspector. Find where it says <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> and change it to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span>. You should now see <span class="strong"><strong>Packing Tag</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Pixels to Units</strong></span>, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor </strong></span>button. Whack that <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor </strong></span>button so we can edit the sprites.</p><p>A shiny new dialog box will open, which will allow you to tell Unity what each individual sprite is within this sprite sheet. Like most things in Unity, this is pretty easy—simply click and drag the cursor around each individual sprite. This will draw a box around each one! As you do this, a little sprite popup will be displayed in the bottom-right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window, which gives you some precision controls on the position of the sprite and allows you to change the pivot. You may also click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Trim</strong></span> button to help trim the box of any unneeded empty space around the sprite, which will trim the sprite down based on the transparency of the sprite.</p><p>As you draw <a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a>out the position for each sprite, you will want to make sure the pivot is set for the bottom each sprite. Another option would be to go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> menu (top left), leave <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span> as the <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> option, change the pivot to <span class="strong"><strong>Right,</strong></span> and click on the slice button. Think of this like the origin point of the sprite—it will rotate from this point, react from this point, and exist from this point. You will also want to set the name of the sprites to something clear. Name the first 4 sprites <code class="literal">playerSprite_idle_01</code>, <code class="literal">playerSprite_idle_02</code>, <code class="literal">playerSprite_idle_03</code>, and <code class="literal">playerSprite_idle_04</code>, and the final three sprites <code class="literal">playerSprite_walk_01</code>, <code class="literal">playerSprite_walk_02</code>, and <code class="literal">playerSprite_walk_03</code>. With the sprites defined, your <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window should now look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_06.jpg" /></div><p>When you are happy with how the sprite setup looks, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button in the top-right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window. You can also now close the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> tab. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, you'll notice that <code class="literal">playerSpriteSheet</code> now has individual sprites for each of the sprites you just set up! You now have a properly configured sprite sheet to use in the project.</p><p>Let's now place the <a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a>player in the world just like we did for the platform. Drag-and-drop <code class="literal">playerSprite_idle_1</code> into the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab, rename the sprite to <code class="literal">Player</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, and change the position to <code class="literal">X: 0, Y: 0</code>. The player should now be standing on top of the platform as shown in the following screenshot. If it looks a bit large, no problem—just change the scale to <code class="literal">X: 0.7, Y: 0.7</code> and it should look fine.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_07.jpg" /></div></div>
