What would really help here is we should have a nice impact effect when the boss lands on a platform, so let's make the boss emit dust when he slams against the ground. To do this, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create another empty GameObject node and name it <code class="literal">DropFXSpawnPoint</code>.</p></li><li><p>Make the new object a child of the <code class="literal">Boss</code> object and position it near the bottom-center of the boss sprite.</p></li><li><p>Create a particle system that looks like dust/smoke bursting out; this will be used whenever the boss lands on a platform to give a nice visual. Use the particle image in <code class="literal">Sprites\Particles\Particle_Smoke.png</code>.</p></li><li><p>Make the new particle system a Prefab, and then attach this new Prefab to the <span class="strong"><strong>Boss Drop FX</strong></span> field of the <code class="literal">Boss</code> object.</p></li><li><p>Add the <span class="strong"><strong>DropFXSpawnPoint</strong></span> node to the <span class="strong"><strong>Drop FXSpawn Point</strong></span> field.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, when the boss falls onto a platform, he should end up looking a little bit like the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564_05_02.jpg" /></div><p>You will <a id="id157" class="indexterm"></a>want to create a good particle emitter effect as well for when the boss is defeated. Add the <span class="strong"><strong>BossDeathFX</strong></span> object to the <span class="strong"><strong>Boss Death FX</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel of the <span class="strong"><strong>Boss </strong></span>object. We've included a Prefab with the example project, which is a nice, showering explosion of red metal shards. They burst everywhere and rain down the screen for a few moments, making a very satisfying visual to defeat the boss.</p></div>
