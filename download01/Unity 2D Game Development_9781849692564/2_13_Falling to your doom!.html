For this game, we don't need to be<a id="id71" class="indexterm"></a> too concerned about the player's specific shape; so for that reason, we can use a <a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>box collider</strong></span>. We don't want to use a circle or polygon collider here because it would result in the player just sliding off the platform. A box collider gives a nice, flat surface for the physics to collide with. A box collider is also the quickest type of collider to use for performance. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> object and attach a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> component to it, which is found under <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics 2D</strong></span> in the menu bar. The collision box on your player should look like the box in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_02_05.jpg" /></div><p>Now that the player has collision information, let's give it some actual physics. Attach a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> component to the player. A <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span>
<a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>component is sort of what it sounds like—a physical body that is completely rigid, as opposed to a <span class="strong"><strong>Softbody</strong></span>
<a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a> component that would be used for things such as cloth, rubber, and hair.</p><p>With the Rigidbody 2D component attached, change its <span class="strong"><strong>Gravity Scale</strong></span> property to <code class="literal">2</code>. This scales the gravity to something a bit higher so that the player can fall in a more realistic manner. If you play with the gravity scale setting, you can see how different types of objects would have different gravity scales—it allows heavy objects to fall quickly, and very light objects to fall slowly (or even rise)!</p><p>Also, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Sleeping Mode</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Start Awake</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Collision Detection</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Continuous</strong></span>. We want this to be continuous because the player is constantly moving and in control; therefore, we need the player to always be carefully checking its collisions. If you were to set it to something other than <span class="strong"><strong>Continuous</strong></span>, there is a higher chance of the physical collisions not registering, causing the player object to pass through other colliders.</p><p>Finally, go into the <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> component on the player. Disable <span class="strong"><strong>Apply Root Motion</strong></span> and<a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a> enable <span class="strong"><strong>Animate Physics</strong></span> by clicking on the checkboxes. This allows the physics to have a little more control of the animations—something we don't really take advantage of in this sample project. However, we still do this to prevent the engine from making unwanted physics adjustments.</p><p>If you play the game now, you can move the player and fall off the edges of the platform! And you can fall forever and ever, and you just keep falling—forever.</p><p>That's boring.</p><p>In the real world, you can't fall down a pit that's not more than a screen deep without turning into a shower of dead pixels (<span class="emphasis"><em>"Shower of Dead Pixels"</em></span> just so happens to be the name of my cover band). In this game, the player should cease to exist as well. At least, they should cease to exist for a few short moments.</p></div>
