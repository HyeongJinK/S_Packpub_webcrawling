At this point, you should have a very good feeling for what it takes to build a 2D game in the Unity game engine. Overall, it is a rather simple transition from 3D to 2D games, provided you follow the guidelines listed in this book.</p><p>In reality, much of what was discussed here are raw examples, and they can be greatly improved, merged, or generally molded to be more of what your game needs. There is so much that could be expanded upon to turn <span class="emphasis"><em>RageTanks</em></span> into a true platformer with more levels, more bosses, more enemies, and even multiple characters. And with the power of Unity and the techniques described in this book, this would be quite easy to do.</p><p>So, diligent reader, where should you go from here? Why don't you try expanding <span class="emphasis"><em>RageTanks</em></span> on your own! Here are some things you can try:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give the player health and a visual health bar, and make it lose health with each touch of an enemy rather than simply dying</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in health pickups for the player to collect</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make the enemies capable of firing weapons at the player when the player is nearby</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give the boss improved AI so that he will try and land on the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In the boss battle, give the player a fighting chance; add a warning arrow to the platform that the boss will land on</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip26"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pro tip</strong></span>
</p><p>Take your Unity game development to an entirely new plane of reality. Pick up other Unity books from Packt Publishing to understand the engine from every possible angle, allowing your capabilities to be nothing short of godly.</p></div><p>Thank you, dear reader, for taking the time to read this book. It has been a pleasure writing it, and I hope you have had just as much fun reading it as I did writing. Most importantly, I hope you have learned quite a lot from this book and are now much more comfortable in producing 2D games in the Unity game engine!</p><p>Until the next book, this is your friendly neighborhood Dave Calabrese, signing off.</p></div>
