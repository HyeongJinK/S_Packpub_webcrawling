Science advances by learning how things worked in the past then improving upon them. Video games <a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a>are quite the same in that they learn how things worked in the past, improve them, and then double the explosions. Although the actual improvement of games is in the eyes of the beholder, few can argue the extreme advancements that have been made in game technology—both visually and in capability.</p><p>Today, we live in a world of hyper-advanced 3D graphics rendered by computers that are powerful enough to rise against us and dominate our race. Some games even challenge the player to compare their visuals against those in real life and determine which is the game and which is real. New technological advancements now even allow a full-body scan of an actor or actress that can then be applied as a texture to a 3D model. The same model can also be built off a 3D scan of the same actor/actress and <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>placed in a real-time game environment. The result is a 3D character that, when properly lit, can bypass the uncanny valley.</p><p>Many <a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a>gamers, however, find themselves craving something a bit more classic. Some want a more approachable gaming experience without all the triple-axis complexity of three-dimensional space. Many just remember a simpler time, when a scene only traveled in a pair of dimensions rather than a full trio. It is for these gamers—who in reality make up an incredibly large group—that the art of 2D games has been revived. Many of those gamers are also people who now want to make games—and want to make the kinds of games they grew up with. You might fit that exact category! In addition, the boom of mobile devices and tablets over the past five years has also added to the resurgence of 2D gaming due to the hardware limitations on these devices. However, this revival has not come with the same dark-age technology that was used to make classic 2D games and evolved into what we make games with today. No, instead, today's 2D game technology has embraced the power that makes today's video games possible, and combines it with the design strengths that made the first video games feasible.</p><p>For this happy marriage, we combine the power of a 3D game engine with the techniques of a 2D video game to create something that is neither new nor old, yet is both.</p><p>Overkill? Most certainly not. There is actually a lot that a 3D game engine<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> can do just as well as a<a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a> 2D game engine—and much more. And in reality, most 2D game engines these days are actually 3D engines in disguise, as everything on the screen is rendered as a two-poly quad or a square built from two triangles, thanks to the power of OpenGL<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> or <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>DirectX.</p><p>One of today's most powerful <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>game engines, which is affordable for large and small companies alike, is the Unity game<a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a> engine available on the Web at <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3D.com" target="_blank">http://unity3D.com</a>. Throughout this book, we will be using the Unity game engine to learn how to build 2D video games. We will learn how to think in 2D—we will operate the camera in 2D, learn how to move in the environment in 2D, and learn how to build a platformer video game in 2D. There will even be a few surprises in there for good measure. Version 4.3 of Unity has built-in native 2D game support because they love you and your awesome game creation skills.</p><p>Before we get started, let's go over some basics. This is a professional book; however, it is written to be useful for anyone. It is expected that you will understand how to use the Unity game engine—we will not be explaining the basics, nor will we be explaining how to build games in Unity. We will, however, explain how to build a 2D game in Unity using Unity 4.3's all-new 2D capabilities. If you have been building 2D games prior to Version 4.3, then you're probably already familiar with using a number of tricks, such as the Box 2D physics engine<a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>, jointed paper doll sprites, and physics plane restrictions. All of that information is still quite worthwhile as it translates well into what Unity 4.3+ now offers.</p><p>This book uses the C#<a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a> programming language for its scripting. You should have enough understanding of C# to read and understand the scripts we are supplying. We will not be discussing the basics of programming languages or why C# works the way it does (which as most programmers know, works on a mix of caffeine and fairy dust, with just the slightest hint of magic smoke). </p><p>If you don't meet those requirements, read along anyway! Since you were awesome enough to pick up this book, I'm sure you are also smart enough to learn as you go.</p><p>The first thing you will want to do now is open Unity<a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a> and create a new project. On the project creation window, use the following settings: call your new project <code class="literal">Ragetanks</code> <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>and make sure that you set the <span class="strong"><strong>Set up defaults for</strong></span> dropdown to <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span>. This is <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_14.jpg" /></div><p>This will be the project in which our work will be done throughout the course of this book. So, grab some coffee, soda, or your favorite libation, and strap on your crash helmet. It's time to go 88 miles per hour into the future's past as we build 2D video games in Unity!</p></div>
