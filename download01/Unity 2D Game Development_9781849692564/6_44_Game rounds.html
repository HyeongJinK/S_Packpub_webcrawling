<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec45"></a>Game rounds</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Back in the day of <a id="id161" class="indexterm"></a>classic games—we're talking the times of Pac-Man and Tetris—the gameplay became more difficult with each playthrough of the game. Just like those titles of yesteryear, we should have our example game become more difficult each time you pass through it by defeating the boss. Start off by adding a new 3D Text object called <code class="literal">Round</code>. Place it in the upper-right corner of the screen and set it up exactly the way you did with the <span class="strong"><strong>Score</strong></span> object, making it a child of the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object and everything. Also, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span> field to <span class="strong"><strong>right</strong></span> and its <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>upper right</strong></span> so that it will properly show on the right-hand side of the screen.</p><p>Create a new script called <code class="literal">RoundWatcher</code>, attach it to the <span class="strong"><strong>Round</strong></span> object, and make it look like the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

[RequireComponent(typeof(TextMesh))]
public class RoundWatcher : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int currRound = 1;
    private TextMesh roundDisplayMesh = null;

    void Start ()
    {        
        roundDisplayMesh = gameObject.GetComponent&lt;TextMesh&gt;();    
         
        currRound = 1;
        roundDisplayMesh.text = "Round: " + currRound.ToString();
     }
    
    void OnEnable()
    {
        BossEventController.bossDied += increaseRound;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        BossEventController.bossDied -= increaseRound;         
    }

    void increaseRound(int ignore)
    {
        currRound += 1;
        roundDisplayMesh.text = "Round: " + currRound.ToString();    
    }
}</pre></div><p>Now, whenever you<a id="id162" class="indexterm"></a> defeat the boss, the round will increase by one. Let's use that same round number to make things more difficult for the player. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Text Mesh</strong></span> field of the <span class="strong"><strong>Round</strong></span> object, name its tag <code class="literal">RoundWatcher</code>. </p><p>If you don't remember<a id="id163" class="indexterm"></a> how to set up tags, we'll remind you; they're easy! Just click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Tag</strong></span> drop-down menu in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, add a new tag, and then go back to the object and select the tag in the drop-down menu.</p><p>Open up <code class="literal">EnemyControllerScript</code> and add the following code at the bottom of the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">        // Find the round watcher object
        GameObject roundWatcherObject = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("RoundWatcher");
        
        if (roundWatcherObject != null)
        {
            RoundWatcher roundWatcherComponent = roundWatcherObject.GetComponent&lt;RoundWatcher&gt;();
            
            // Increase the enemy speed for each round.
            walkingSpeed = walkingSpeed * roundWatcherComponent.currRound;
        }</pre></div><p>Make sure to also <a id="id164" class="indexterm"></a>reduce the initial <span class="strong"><strong>Walking Speed</strong></span> value of the enemy to 0.25, or else they will get crazy fast very quickly. Also, make a note that after a while, the enemies will start shooting out of the vortexes so quickly that they can actually get trapped in the scenery. Challenge yourself to adjust the code to either cap the enemy speed, make the enemies drop out of the vortexes instead of shooting out at their current speed, or come up with your<a id="id165" class="indexterm"></a> own solution. That's the beauty of games such as these—the solution that you feel is right is most likely the correct one.</p></div>
