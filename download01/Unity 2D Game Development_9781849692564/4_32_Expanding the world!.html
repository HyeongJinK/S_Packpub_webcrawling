We already have a camera that follows the player and also all the Prefabs we need to add platforms and enemies. So, let's start by building up the level a bit more. Have some fun here and put up a bunch of new platforms. Drag-and-drop the <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> Prefab from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab into the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab. Make sure the player can jump between the platforms, or the game won't be much fun. Also, make sure your <span class="strong"><strong>Death Trigger</strong></span> object covers the full area below your level. With all these new platforms, be sure to also place a bunch of new enemies on them, because awesome platforms need awesome enemies.</p><p>Next, you will want to wall in the player so that it can't leave the level area. The main concept to think of here is that you need to wall off all four sides—top, bottom, left, and right—so that the player and enemies cannot escape the level area. This is actually true for any 2D game; puzzle games need to keep their game pieces within the 2D gameplay area, platformers keep the player and enemies in the 2D gameplay area, and so forth. This doesn't need to be a box either. Many game levels for both 2D and 3D games have very odd-shaped level areas. It's all about making sure the players can't escape into the nether that exists outside the game. Go ahead and do a little something as outlined in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Import the <code class="literal">Wall.png</code> image map, located in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> package in <code class="literal">Sprites\Scenery\Wall.png</code>, and set it up like the other sprites you've imported.</p></li><li><p>Drop one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> sprites into your scene and give it a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> component.</p></li><li><p>Adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> field of the box collider so that it's <code class="literal">20</code>; this will make sure the player can't escape even if they jump above the wall.</p></li><li><p>Now go ahead and drop a <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> sprite on either side of your level to prevent escape!</p></li><li><p>Make sure the death trigger fills the entire gap below them and that the player is safely sealed inside the intended play-area.</p></li><li><p>Create a new GameObject called <code class="literal">_WallContainer</code> and store the <code class="literal">Wall</code> objects inside to keep things clean.</p></li></ol></div><p>Your scene should now <a id="id132" class="indexterm"></a>look something like the following screenshot. Don't worry if your enemies and platforms look different—the important thing here is that your walls surround your level on either side.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_04_01.jpg" /></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"></a>Tip</h3><p>Think you have a good sense of how the platforms are positioned in the world?
