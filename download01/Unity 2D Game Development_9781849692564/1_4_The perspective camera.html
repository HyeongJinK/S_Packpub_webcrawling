<a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a> and<a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>. Both have their uses. And I bet you are sitting there thinking, "Orthographic. Totally. We're using that."</p><p>If that's what you said, you'd be correct! However, before <a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a>Unity 4.3, it would have some drawbacks. But we aren't holding anything against you, so here's a cookie (cookie sold separately). For everyone who doesn't know the difference, it's actually quite simple. A perspective camera (on the right in the following image) is Unity's default camera. It shows the scene the way it actually is, just like our eyes see things. Orthographic (on the left in the following image), on the other hand, completely removes depth. So, no matter how far an object is from the camera, it looks like it's right there. Everything parallel remains parallel to the camera. An <a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a>orthographic camera simply renders an object, or it <a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a>doesn't. However, the Z order of objects is maintained. In older versions of Unity, a perspective camera would have done a great job as it would give automatic parallax support, but more about that later.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_15.jpg" /></div><p>Prior to Unity 4.3, we actually would have <a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a>wanted a perspective camera for the simple fact that we could make use of its depth information for easy<a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>parallax scrolling</strong></span>, or a visual effect where things further from the camera move slower (much like how they would in real life). Even in Version 4.3, if you plan to make a 2.5D game (or a 2D game that uses full 3D meshes), then you probably still want to use the perspective camera. Otherwise, for a 2D game in Unity 4.3, make sure that the camera is set to orthographic—which it should have already defaulted to by setting your project defaults to 2D.</p><p>We'll talk more about parallax scrolling and z-depth later in this book.</p></div>
