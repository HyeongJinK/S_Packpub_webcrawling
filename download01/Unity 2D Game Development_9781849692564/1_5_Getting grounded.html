I think it's time we started really getting our hands dirty, don't you? Here is the part where we get to start building a 2D game<a id="id23" class="indexterm"></a>! Yes, it really is that easy. So, let's get started.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pro Tip</strong></span>
</p><p>Images for your video games, as you most likely already know, work best if they are always a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048), because the video card requires image map to be a power of two. Otherwise, the image map will automatically be resized to be a power of two by the game engine. While this is not as noticeable in 3D games with mapped imageries, in a 2D game where the 1:1 art for the image map is quite important, it can easily look stretched or blurry.</p></div><p>Considering that this is a 2D platformer, the first thing we will want to do is build the ground. This is because without the ground, our heroes and villains would just fall through space forever.</p><p>This book comes with asset files which can be downloaded from the publisher's website. Once you acquire those assets, follow these simple steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Find the <code class="literal">Textures</code> folder, and inside that, look for the <code class="literal">Scenery</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Import the image labeled <code class="literal">Platform.png</code>.</p></li><li><p>To keep things nice and clean, let's also create a folder called <code class="literal">Textures</code> within your project (the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab). Inside that, create another folder called <code class="literal">Scenery</code> and put the <code class="literal">Platform</code> texture in there.</p></li></ol></div><p>Unity 4.3 now has the texture type of <a id="id24" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span>. You can find this by selecting the <code class="literal">Platform</code> texture file in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and looking over at the inspector. With the project in 2D defaults, it will automatically import textures in <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> mode—which you can see at the top of the inspector. Most of these options will already be set properly, but let's change the texture <span class="strong"><strong>Max Size</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>512</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Format</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>16 bits</strong></span>. A size of 512 makes sure that Unity recognizes the image as anything up to 512 x 512 before it resizes it to something smaller. <span class="strong"><strong>16 bits</strong></span> makes sure it's an <a id="id25" class="indexterm"></a>uncompressed image which allows trillions of possible colors. That's kind of an overkill in most cases for classic 2D sprites; however, many modern sprites share similarities with modern high-resolution textures for 3D games. Unity also doesn't have a setting for 8-bit imagery, so 16-bit is a great setting to use! Compression? That tries to literally compress the image to take up less space, at the penalty of a lower quality image. In most cases, you won't want a compressed image. However, it will have its uses. Now, if you wanted your art to look more pixelated, set <span class="strong"><strong>Filter Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Point</strong></span>. Otherwise, give <span class="strong"><strong>Bilinear</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Trilinear</strong></span> filtering a shot to add some excellent smoothing to the visuals.</p><p>The following screenshot shows what the import settings<a id="id26" class="indexterm"></a> should look like for your sprite platform:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_04.jpg" /></div><p>When creating <a id="id27" class="indexterm"></a>images for a 2D game in Unity or any modern game<a id="id28" class="indexterm"></a> engine, be careful not to use true gradients. You can use gradients, but the image map will need to have its format set to <span class="strong"><strong>Truecolor</strong></span> to look proper. Otherwise, the gradient will look like a set of hard-colored segments. While the <code class="literal">Truecolor</code> property allows the image to render properly, it takes up more space in video memory.</p><p>To get this platform into your <a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a>scene, simply drag the platform image from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and drop it into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab or the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab. It auto-magically appears within the scene. Make sure its position in the scene is <code class="literal">X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0</code> and its scale is <code class="literal">X: 1, Y: 1, Z: 1</code>. </p><p>To make sure our player can walk on this, we'll need to give it some collider properties. With the platform selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, navigate your cursor to the menus at the top of the screen and then <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics 2D</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>|</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Polygon Collider 2D</strong></span>. You could also go to the inspector with the platform selected, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> button at the bottom, and search for Polygon Collider 2D. Both ways work, and you are welcome to do as you wish anytime we ask you to add a component to an object".</p><p>With the platform selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab, you'll now see a bunch of green lines going through the platform. This is by far one of the coolest features of Unity 4.3's 2D support—it automatically creates a polygon collider based on the shape of your texture (as shown in the following image)! This saves many potential headaches. Unity determines the shape of the collider based on the alpha of your image, so do keep that in mind when creating your artwork.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_05.jpg" /></div><p>Now, in reality, we could <a id="id30" class="indexterm"></a>have just used a simple box collider for this platform as well. However, we would like our enemies to be able to collide realistically with the platform. On the sides of the platform, it indents in a little. If you try applying a Box Collider 2D<a id="id31" class="indexterm"></a> instead of the <a id="id32" class="indexterm"></a>Polygon Collider 2D, which you can see in the following image, you'll see that it goes straight down at the sides:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_01_13.jpg" /></div><p>There are many <a id="id33" class="indexterm"></a>platforms that a simple box collider would work properly on. However, take a look at the imagery of this platform—it has an indentation on both sides. If you were to put a simple box collider on this, the collision would go straight down from the edges of the platform. Any bullet that collided with the box collider would disappear, which wouldn't look correct. We want those bullets to disappear when they hit the actual graphics. You now have a platform! </p><p>This would also be a good time to save your scene for the first time. Name it <code class="literal">RageTanksScene</code> and place the scene within a folder called <code class="literal">Scenes</code>.</p></div>
