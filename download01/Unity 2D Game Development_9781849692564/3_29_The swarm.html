<span class="strong"><strong>Pro tip</strong></span>
</p><p>Tried placing two enemies on the same platform? You probably noticed that they collide with one another and prevent any further movement. Use what you have learned to modify their collision properties so that an enemy cannot collide with other enemies. Also, try to make the enemies swap directions when they are getting close to one another!</p></div></div>
