First things first, let's make that platform standard. Let's create a <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> with it. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, create a folder called <code class="literal">Prefabs</code>. Now, drag-and-drop the <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> into the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> folder to automatically turn it into a Prefab. Now you can go ahead and place more platforms around the scene by dragging and dropping the platform from the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> folder into the scene, spacing them so the player can jump between them. This is the power of Prefabs. Because now if we need to change the platform, we simply change the one in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab and <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> placed platforms in the game world will automatically update with the changes.</p><p>Let's keep this organized. Create a new empty GameObject and name it <code class="literal">Platform Container</code>. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, drag-and-drop all of the platforms into this new object, making them children of it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564OT_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>All this does is<a id="id104" class="indexterm"></a> keep things a bit cleaner and easier to work with.</p></div>
