The player can die. Enemies can fight. The player can defend. Enemies can respawn.</p><p>It has been quite a journey. You have learned about 2D games in 3D worlds. You have learned the power of Unity and how to wield that power to produce 2D games.</p><p>Now we have reached the end. But to succeed, there must be one final challenge. This challenge will encompass all that you have learned, all you know, and prove that you have what it takes to save the world; or make a 2D game in Unity, which is pretty much the same thing.</p><p>The chorus sings and the guitars play. You stand there, with your weapon in hand. Everything depends on you and your abilities.</p><p>It's time for the final boss battle.</p></div>
