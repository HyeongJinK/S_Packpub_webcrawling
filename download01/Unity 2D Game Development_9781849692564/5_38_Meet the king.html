A postmortem was written on <span class="emphasis"><em>Silent Hill 4</em></span> in the March 2005 issue of <span class="emphasis"><em>Game Developer</em></span> magazine, where the desire to ship the game with more boss encounters was discussed. However, due to the complexity of these battles and their allotted budget, the development team had to work with what they could afford and ship games with less monstrous fear battles. If a company as massive, well-structured, and capable as Konami will fear the boss battle, then so should you.</p><p>Cerulean Games<a id="id144" class="indexterm"></a> has worked on games with boss battles, and its author has personally programmed a number of these encounters. Boss battles should be looked at like a unique mini game—they will typically require a decent amount of unique code and a lot of focused testing to ensure accuracy and stability.</p><p>The first thing we should think about is what the boss battle will do, how it will challenge the player, and how it will progress. For our example game, we are going to have a rather simple boss. The king—as he shall be dubbed—will fall from the sky on to a platform, dance around allowing the player to hit him, and then jump across to fall and land on another platform. When the king has taken enough hits, he will be defeated. </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"></a>Tip</h3><p>Many boss battles act as a form of puzzle. In World of Warcraft, Blizzard went to great trouble to make sure their epic raid battles incorporated strategies, alternate methods, and fun events. Planning all of that in advance is key to a good boss battle. Of course, video games are iterative, so chances are you can't plan everything in advance. So, if you are going to build a very involved boss encounter, build it up in pieces. Do whatever you can to avoid a scenario where you are adding loads of features, otherwise the boss can lose its fun and you might miss your deadline!</p></div><p>Let's also determine what the <a id="id145" class="indexterm"></a>boss should look like. Based on our evil red tanks, let's make him a big metal beast with a similar art style, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692564/graphics/2564_05_01.jpg" /></div><p>Yeah, that will work.</p><p>Open the <a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a>Graphics package you downloaded from Packt's site and find the boss' sprite sheet in <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites\Boss</strong></span> and import it to the project. Build out the sprites from the sprite sheet (like you have been doing) and animate those suckers.</p><p>We know how we want the boss battle to go down, and we know what the new challenger looks like. Now, it's time to build a boss.</p></div>
