For instance, select <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> and look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. One of the Components is the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span>. Without that Component, it will cease being a camera. It would still be a GameObject in your scene, just no longer a functioning camera.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec40"></a>Variables become Component properties</h3></div></div></div><p>Any Component of <a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a>any GameObject is just a script that defines a class, whether you wrote the script or the Unity's programmer did. We just aren't supposed to edit the scripts that Unity wrote. This means that all the properties we see in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> are just variables of some type. They simply store data that will be used by some methods.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec41"></a>Unity changes script and variable names slightly</h3></div></div></div><p>When we add our script to a GameObject, the name of our script shows up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel as a<a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a> Component. Unity makes a couple of small changes. You might have noticed that when we added <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> to <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, Unity actually showed it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel as <span class="strong"><strong>Learning Script</strong></span>. Unity added a space to separate the words of the name. Unity does this modification to the variable names, too. Notice that the variable <code class="literal">number1</code> is shown as <span class="strong"><strong>Number 1</strong></span>, and <code class="literal">number2</code> as <span class="strong"><strong>Number 2</strong></span>. Unity capitalizes the first letter as well. These displayed changes improve readability in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec42"></a>Changing a property's value in the Inspector panel</h3></div></div></div><p>There are <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>two situations when you can modify a property value:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>During the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>During the development mode (not in the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode)</p></li></ul></div><p>When you are in the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode, you will see that your changes take effect immediately in real time.

This means that if you quit Unity and restart it again, the changes will be retained. Of course you won't see the effect of your change until you click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>The changes you make to the property values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel do not modify your script. The only way your script can be changed is for you to edit it in the script editor (MonoDevelop). The values shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel override any values you had assigned in your script.</p></div><p>If you desire to undo the changes you've made in the<a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, you can reset the values to the default values assigned in your script. Click on the Cog icon (the gear) on the  far right of the Component script, and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_03_01.jpg" /></div></div></div>
