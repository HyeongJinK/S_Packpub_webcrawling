<span class="emphasis"><em>Scripts do many things by accessing the features built into Unity and third-party plugins. The Unity Scripting Reference is our link to the built-in Unity features. The thing is, exactly how do we invoke all of those Unity features?</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So far all we've covered is basic C# programming. Granted, the example code we've seen has included some Dot Syntax, such as Debug.Log() to send output to Unity's Console. This is one of those Unity features. In the last chapter, we even saw some more Dot Syntax, pony.Key and pony.Value, which has nothing to do with Unity. These are just C# OOP (Object Oriented Programming) related features.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>In both cases, there's some type of communication taking place to access methods and data to make things happen. To the beginner, those dots maybe odd looking and confusing, and they may ask, "What's the deal with all those darn dots between words?" Well, if you've been using the Internet and paid any attention at all, you've been using those dots, probably for years, and didn't pay much attention to them.</em></span>
</p><p>We see how to access the power of Dot Syntax as we cover the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dot Syntax being just an address</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with objects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using Dot Syntax in a script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Accessing GameObjects using drag-and-drop versus writing code</p></li></ul></div><p>So let's get on with it...</p></div>
