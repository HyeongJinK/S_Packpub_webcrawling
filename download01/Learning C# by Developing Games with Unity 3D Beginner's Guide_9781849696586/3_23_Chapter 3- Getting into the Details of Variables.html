<span class="emphasis"><em>Initially, computer programming appears difficult to beginners due to the fact how words are used in code. It's not the actual words that cause the problem because, for the most part, many of the words are the same words that we use in our everyday life. C# is not a foreign language. The main problem is that the words simply don't read like the typical sentences we are all used to. You know how to say the words and you know how to spell the words. What you don't know is where and why you need to put them in that crazy looking grammar, that is, the syntax that makes up a C #statement.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we will learn some of the basic rules for writing a C# statement. We will also be introduced to many of the words that C# uses and the proper placement of these words in the C# statements when we create our variables.</em></span>
</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing C# statements properly</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using C# syntax to write variable statements</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The GameObject Component's properties</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using public variables for the Unity Inspector panel</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Naming a variable properly</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Declaring a variable for the type of data it will store</p></li></ul></div><p>Ok, let's learn some programming grammar, otherwise known as C# syntax.</p></div>
