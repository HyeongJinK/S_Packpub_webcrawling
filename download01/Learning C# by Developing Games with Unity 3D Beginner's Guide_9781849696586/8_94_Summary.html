We started by creating four States and setting up the <code class="literal">StateManager</code> class to be the controller with the help of a C# interface. We learned how to load Scenes when switching States, and keep GameObjects from being destroyed in the process. We also covered using timers and how to pause a Scene.</p><p>For such simple code, the State Machine offers a tremendous amount of control and flexibility in organizing your game code. Let's start off the next chapter by using this State Machine to actually control a few GameObjects and change States.</p></div>
