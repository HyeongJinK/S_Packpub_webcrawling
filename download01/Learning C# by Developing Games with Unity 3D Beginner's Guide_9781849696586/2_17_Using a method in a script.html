<span class="strong"><strong>Methods</strong></span> are where<a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a> the action is and where the tasks are performed. Great, that's really nice to know but what is a method?</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec30"></a>What is a method?</h3></div></div></div><p>When we write a script, we are making lines of code that the computer is going to execute, one line at a time. As we write our code, there will be things we want our game to execute more than once. For example, we can write a code that adds two numbers. Suppose our game needs to add the two numbers together a hundred different times during the game. So you say, <span class="emphasis"><em>"Wow, I have to write the same code a hundred times that adds two numbers together. There has to be a better way."</em></span>
</p><p>Let a method take away your typing pain. You just have to write the code to add two numbers once, and then give this chunk of code a name, such as <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code>. Now, every time our game needs to add two numbers, don't write the code over and over, just call the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method.</p></div></div>
