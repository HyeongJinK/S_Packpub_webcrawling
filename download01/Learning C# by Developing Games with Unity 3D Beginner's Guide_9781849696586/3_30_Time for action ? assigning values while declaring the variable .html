The variables that I have shown you so far are called <span class="strong"><strong>member variables</strong></span>. They are members of the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class, not declared within any method. These member variables are the only variables that have the option of being displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel or being accessed by other scripts.</p><p>So where in the class should the member variables be declared? This is another subject that can lead to<a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a> heated discussions. Personally, I declare them at the top of a class file before any methods are declared so that I see them all in one place. Other people like to declare variables close to the point of first use in a method.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>Declaring your member variables at the beginning of a class may give you a mental clue that these member variables can be used everywhere in the script.</p></div><p>We will also be creating variables in methods. These variables are called as <span class="strong"><strong>local variables</strong></span> and are never displayed in the Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, nor can they be accessed by other scripts. This brings us to another programming concept called <span class="strong"><strong>variable scope</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec50"></a>Variable scope – determining where a variable can be used</h3></div></div></div><p>Variable scope is a fancy way <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>of saying "Where in the script does a variable exist". The following screenshot explains you the scope of variables:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_03_05.jpg" /></div><p>You might have noticed that the rectangular blocks start and end with curly-braces. Just like the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing the Building blocks for Unity Scripts</em></span>, the code between the opening curly-brace and a closing curly-brace is called a <span class="strong"><strong>code block</strong></span>.<a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a> Absolutely anywhere in a code that you have an opening curly-brace, there will be a closing <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>curly-brace to match. All the code between the two braces is a code block.</p><p>Notice that the code blocks can be nested inside other code blocks.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>You normally don't just create bare blocks of code with curly-braces like I did with <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. Code blocks are usually part of other things such as if statements, looping statements, and methods. This example is just to demonstrate how the scope of a variable works, and where a variable exists and is useable.</p></div><p>The following is what you have:</p><p>Line 16: <code class="literal">string block3 = "Block 3 text";</code>
</p><p>The preceding line declares a local <code class="literal">string</code> variable named <code class="literal">block3</code>. This variable exists in the code block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>. If you try to use the variable <code class="literal">block3</code> outside of <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span>, such as in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2 </strong></span>or<span class="strong"><strong> Code Block 1</strong></span>, Unity will give you an error message saying that variable <code class="literal">block3</code> doesn't exist.</p><p>The scope of the variable <code class="literal">block3</code> is the code block defined by the curly-braces of lines 13 and 18.</p><p>Now let's look at the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable:</p><p>Line 6: <code class="literal">string block1 = "Block 1 text";</code>
</p><p>The preceding line declares a <code class="literal">string</code> type member variable named <code class="literal">block1</code>. This variable exists in the code <a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a>block that is labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. This code block begins on line 5 and ends on line 20. This means the variable <code class="literal">block1</code> can be used everywhere, including <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2 and Code Block 3</strong></span> because, they are also within <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 1</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is used in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 2</strong></span> on line 10, and in <span class="strong"><strong>Code Block 3</strong></span> on line 14.</p><p>The scope of the <code class="literal">block1</code> variable is the code block defined by the curly-braces between lines 5 and 20.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec51"></a>Pop quiz – knowing how to declare a variable</h3></div></div></div><p>Q1.
