In fact, what Unity does with a class a little piece of magic when Unity creates Components.</p><p>You just learned about variables and methods. These two items are the building blocks used to build Unity scripts. The term script is used everywhere in discussions and documents. Look it up in the dictionary and it can be generally described as written text. Sure enough, that's what we have. However, since we aren't just writing a screenplay or passing a note to someone, we need to learn the actual terms used in programming.</p><p>Unity calls the code it creates a C# script. However, people like me have to teach you some basic programming <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>skills and tell you that a script is really a class.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>In the previous section about methods, we created a class (script) called <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>. It contained a couple of variables and a method. The main concept or idea of a class is that it's a container of data, stored in variables, and methods that process that data in some fashion. Because I don't have to constantly write class (script), I will be using the word script most of the time. However, I will also be using class when getting more specific with C#. Just remember that a script is a class that is attached to a GameObject.</p></div><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the Gameplay is Just a Part of the Game</em></span>, we will be creating some classes for a State Machine. These classes will not be attached to any GameObjects, so I won't be calling them scripts.</p></div>
