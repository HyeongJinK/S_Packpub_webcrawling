Wave the magic wand — ZAP — the script file is now called a Component, and the public variables of the script are now the properties you can see and change in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>
<a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a> panel.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec35"></a>A more technical look at the magic</h3></div></div></div><p>A script is like a blueprint or a written description. In other words, it's just a single file in a folder on our hard drive. We can see it right there in the <span class="strong"><strong>Projects</strong></span> panel. It can't do anything just sitting there. When we tell Unity to attach it to a GameObject, we haven't created another copy of the file, all we've done is tell Unity we want the behaviors described in our script to be a<a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a> Component of the GameObject.</p><p>When we click on the <a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button, Unity loads the GameObject into the computer's memory. Since the script is attached to a GameObject, Unity also has to make a place in the computer's memory to store a Component as part of the GameObject. The Component has the capabilities specified in the script (blueprint) we created.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec36"></a>Even more Unity magic</h3></div></div></div><p>There's some more magic you need to be aware of. The scripts inherit from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>.</p><p>For beginners to Unity, studying C# inheritance isn't a subject you need to learn in any great detail, but you do need to know that each Unity script uses inheritance. We see the code in every script that will be attached to a GameObject. In <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>, the code is on line 4:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class LearningScript : MonoBehaviour</pre></div><p>The colon and the last word of that code means that the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> class is inheriting behaviors from the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class. This simply means that the MonoBehaviour class is making few of its variables and methods available to the LearningScript class. It's no coincidence that the variables and methods inherited look just like some of the code we saw in the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Scripting Reference</strong></span>.</p><p>The following are the two inherited behaviors in the <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>:</p><p>Line 9:: <code class="literal">void Start ()</code>
</p><p>Line 14: <code class="literal">void Update ()</code>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"></a>Note</h3><p>The magic is that you don't have to call these methods, Unity calls them automatically. So the code you place in these methods gets executed automatically.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec37"></a>Have a go hero – finding Start and Update in the Scripting Reference</h3></div></div></div><p>Try a search on the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span> for <span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Update</strong></span> to learn when each method is called by Unity and how often.</p><p>Also search for <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>. This will show you that since our script inherits from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>, we are able to use the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> methods.</p></div></div>
