Yet, for a beginner<a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a> to scripting, even the amount of features available in the Scripting Reference can be overwhelming.</p><p>The good news is the Scripting Reference is exactly what the name implies. It's a reference. It's not meant to <a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a>be a document you have to totally understand before you can begin writing scripts. A reference is a document you search when you need to know how to write the code to perform a specific task.</p><p>That's great, right? Sure it is, sort of. As a beginner, how do you know what to search for? This reminds me of school. Ask the teacher how to spell a word and the teacher always responded with "Look it up in the dictionary." Ok, but how do you find out how to spell a word in a dictionary if you don't know how to spell it to find it? I always thought the teacher's answer was rather lame and a waste of energy. I didn't want a definition, just how to spell it.</p><p>Let's assume that you wanted to <span class="strong"><strong>lerp</strong></span>
<a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a> between two vectors. Say what? Now seriously, how in the world would a beginner know words like this in the first place? What the heck is a "lerp"? Would you know to search for that word in the Scripting Reference?</p><p>Obviously, most beginners wouldn't know a great deal of the terms, classes, variables, and methods available in Unity. This book is about teaching you the basics of C# so that you can understand code examples presented in the Scripting Reference, and be able to implement similar code in your Unity projects.</p><p>Right now, you are at the beginning of your coding education. Learning the fundamentals of C# coding is the easy part, it's like learning how to read and write a sentence.</p><p>Now that you can read the C# code examples in the Scripting Reference, it's time to establish a logical approach to access the information it contains. Yes, reading the Unity Manual and at least glancing through the Reference Manual is a requirement. You may understand C#, but now you also have to know how to access the power in Unity, and C# is your key to unlocking that power. The Scripting Reference is only a good reference if you have a basic understanding of what you are looking for, and that knowledge comes from reading the manuals.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"></a>Note</h3><p>The easiest way to view Unity's documentation is to click on <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> in Unity's menu bar.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec135"></a>Reading the Unity Reference Manual first</h3></div></div></div><p>This manual provides a general overview of the main features (classes) you will be accessing while writing your code. A lot of the terminology you need to know is here. At a minimum, read and <a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a>absorb the terms used and become familiar with the class names in the sections on <span class="strong"><strong>Physics Components</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>The GameObject</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Transform Component</strong></span>.
