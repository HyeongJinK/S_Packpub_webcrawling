<span class="emphasis"><em>It's time to code the State Machine so we can test its operation. We need to write the code for four initial States, the StateManager, and use the <code class="literal">IStateBase</code> interface. We will first have the State Machine work with three States and then show how easy it is to add in the fourth State.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Your Unity project may need more than four States. After you see how easy it is to add a State and how clean, simple, and organized it makes your code, your imagination may run wild on how you could make use of these States.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>The whole purpose of <a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is to create objects, (little packages of data) and action code (methods). In Unity, these objects are used for controlling actions in your Unity project, and they communicate with each other as well. A State Machine is simply a design choice for these objects that allows you to better organize and maintain your code.</em></span>
