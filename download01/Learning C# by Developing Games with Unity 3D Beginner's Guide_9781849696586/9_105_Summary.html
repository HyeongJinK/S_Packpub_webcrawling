As a beginner, probably the most time consuming part of writing code will be searching Unity's documentation for the information you need. We expanded the State Machine and added a <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> GameObject. Planning ahead before writing code is always a good idea. A State Machine is a good option for organizing your project's code. Nine State classes were created for the State machine. We then displayed a splash screen and a button in <code class="literal">BeginState</code>. For the <code class="literal">SetupState</code>, we displayed a spinning <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> and some <span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span> buttons to set <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> options.</p><p>A major point to be taken from writing all this code is that public variables and methods in any class or script are easily accessed. All that's needed is a reference to an object, then you can use Dot Syntax to easily access data and methods.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue the game development by entering our first <code class="literal">PlayState</code> and see how the State Machine provides game control flexibility and code organization.</p></div>
