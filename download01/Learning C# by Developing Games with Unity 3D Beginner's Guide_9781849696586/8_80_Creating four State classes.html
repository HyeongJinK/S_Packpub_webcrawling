Again, this structure, this class interface, is <a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a>guaranteed to be identical because implementing <code class="literal">IStateBase</code> makes it a requirement that certain methods are included in each State.</p><p>When we modify the <code class="literal">StateManager</code>, you'll see that it guarantees each State will implement the <code class="literal">IStateBase</code> interface as a requirement for being a part of the State Machine.</p><p>We already have <code class="literal">BeginState</code> started from the previous chapter, but it needs some modification to be functional in the State Machine. So let's modify <code class="literal">BeginState</code> first, and then create the other three States: <code class="literal">PlayState</code>, <code class="literal">WonState</code>, and <code class="literal">LostState</code>.</p></div>
