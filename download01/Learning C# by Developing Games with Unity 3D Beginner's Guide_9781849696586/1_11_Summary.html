You do have the ability to write down instructions which is all a script is, a sequence of instructions. We saw how simple it is to create a new script file. You probably create files on your computer all the time. We saw how to easily bring up Unity's documentation. Finally we had a look at the MonoDevelop editor. None of this was complicated.

<span class="emphasis"><em> Introducing the Building Blocks for Unity Scripts by having an </em></span>introductory look at the building blocks of programming we'll be using: variables, methods, Dot Syntax, and the class.
