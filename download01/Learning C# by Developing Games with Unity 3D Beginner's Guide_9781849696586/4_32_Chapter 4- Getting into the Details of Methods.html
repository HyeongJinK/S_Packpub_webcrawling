<span class="emphasis"><em>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to a variable's scope—where a variable exists and is allowed to be used. The scope is determined by the "opening" and "closing" curly braces. The purpose of those curly braces is to act as a container for a block of executable code, a code block. In second chapter you saw that a method is a code block that can execute by just calling the method's name. It's time to see the importance of code blocks and the variables used in them. A method defines a code block which begins and ends with curly braces.</em></span>
