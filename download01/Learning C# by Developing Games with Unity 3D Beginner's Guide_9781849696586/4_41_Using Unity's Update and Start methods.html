That's because they are rather important. These are the most commonly used <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> methods, see the next screenshot for others. I like to call these Unity's magic methods because you don't call these methods, Unity does. It's usually important that at least one <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> method<a id="id105" class="indexterm"></a> is included in a Unity script to cause the script to execute. I say usually because other methods in the script may be called from another script or class.</p><p>How do I know these two methods are called by Unity and that they are <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> methods? Here, the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span> is your friend.</p><p>Here's just a portion of the methods Unity can call in a script. This is from the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>. Just search for <code class="literal">MonoBehavior</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_04_05.jpg" /></div><p>Look at line 4 of <span class="strong"><strong>LearningScript</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class LearningScript : MonoBehaviour</pre></div><p>This line says that <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> inherits from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>. Any script that inherits from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> will automatically call the methods <code class="literal">Update()</code> and <code class="literal">Start()</code> if they are in the script. Therefore, if you want, you can create a script in MonoDevelop instead of Unity, just have it inherit from <code class="literal">MonoBehavior</code> by adding:<code class="literal">: MonoBehaviour</code> after the class name.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>Please notice the <span class="strong"><strong>colon</strong></span> that needs to be included.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec64"></a>The Start method is called one time</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity calls this method only one time. When the GameObject your script is attached to is first used in your scene, the <code class="literal">Start()</code> method is called. This method is primarily used to initialize, or setup, the member variables in your script. This allows everything in your script to be ready to go before <code class="literal">Update()</code> is called for the first time.</p><p>You've probably noticed<a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a> that many of the examples I used in <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> are making use of <code class="literal">Start()</code>. These examples weren't initializing any code, I was just taking advantage of the fact that since <code class="literal">Start()</code> is only called once, displaying output to the Console would, therefore, only be displayed once, which just made it easier to see the output displayed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec65"></a>The Update method is called over and over and over…</h3></div></div></div><p>As you study the <a id="id107" class="indexterm"></a>sample code in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>, you will notice that a vast majority of the code is in the <code class="literal">Update()</code> method. As your game runs, the Scene is displayed many times per second. This is called <span class="strong"><strong>Frames per Second</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>. <a id="id108" class="indexterm"></a>After each frame is displayed, the <code class="literal">Update()</code> method is called by Unity to run your code.</p><p>Since <code class="literal">Update()</code> is<a id="id109" class="indexterm"></a> called every frame, it allows your game to detect input, such as mouse clicks and key presses, every frame. User input is one of the topics we are about to cover in the next chapter.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec66"></a>Pop quiz – understanding method operation</h3></div></div></div><p>Q1.
