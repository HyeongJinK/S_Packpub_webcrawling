It's this ability to communicate between objects that make OOP so powerful. Data is kept in objects, and methods are called on an object to get things done. Dot Syntax is just an address to easily access data and methods on objects.</p><p>All right, we've covered the very basics of C# scripting for Unity. Congratulations!</p><p>In the next chapter, I'm going to take you through a combination of Unity coding and general C# coding to actually apply your new knowledge. We will start looking at a State Machine to work with Unity. Yes, it's going to be a simple state machine to show the concepts. You've just barely learned C# scripting, so I'm going to ease you into some game creation which will help you see how to apply the concepts that you've just learned. Besides, bet you're darn sick and tired of constantly modifying, or completely changing <code class="literal">LearningScript</code>.</p></div>
