<code class="literal">PlayStateScene1_1</code> has no code for shooting. <code class="literal">PlayStateScene1_2</code> has code to shoot one <span class="strong"><strong>EnergyPulse</strong></span> at a time. In <span class="strong"><strong>Scene2</strong></span>, <code class="literal">PlayStateScene2</code> has continuous rapid fire shooting.</p><p>To get the appearance of an <span class="strong"><strong>EnergyPulse</strong></span>, we will actually shoot a <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span>. We won't see the <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span> because its rendering will be unchecked. The <span class="strong"><strong>EnergyPulse</strong></span> effect is created by using a <span class="strong"><strong>Trail Renderer</strong></span> effect on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span>.</p></div>
