Then we learned a basic overview of the logic of switching States. We even took a brief glimpse into how Unity creates Components to help your understanding of code logic. Finally, we covered a way to guarantee that each State in a State Machine contains the required methods to make the State Machine work, by using a C# interface.</p><p>There are more great benefits for using a C# interface besides the programming interface it provides. In the next chapter, we get into the details of the State Machine and how the interface can work for us even more.</p></div>
