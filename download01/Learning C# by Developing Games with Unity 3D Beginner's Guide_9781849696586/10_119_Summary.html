We used C# to turn Rigidbody physics on and off for <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span>, and moved the Player using physics forces. A couple of extra cameras were added to provide two ways to follow the Player. We created a scoring system that's displayed on screen during the game. Finally, we covered detecting and using collision and trigger events.</p><p>In the final chapter, we'll review your new C# skills and where to go from here to continue your education.</p></div>
