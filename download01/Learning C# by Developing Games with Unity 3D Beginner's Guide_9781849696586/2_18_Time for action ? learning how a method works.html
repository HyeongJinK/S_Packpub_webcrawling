<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"></a>Time for action – learning how a method works</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We're going to <a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a>edit <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> again. In the following screenshot, there are a few lines of code that look strange. We are not going to get into the details of what they mean in this chapter. We will discuss that in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting into the Details of Methods</em></span>. Right now, I am just showing you a method's basic structure and how it works:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In MonoDevelop, select <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> for editing.</p></li><li><p>Edit the file so that it looks exactly like the following screenshot.</p></li><li><p>Save the file.</p></li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586_02_05.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec31"></a>What's in this script file?</h3></div></div></div><p>In the previous screenshot, lines 6 and 7 will look familiar to you; they are variables just as you learned<a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a> in the previous section. There are two of them this time. These variables store the numbers that are going to be added.</p><p>Line 16 may look very strange to you. Don't concern yourself right now with how this works. Just know that it's a line of code that lets the script know when the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key is pressed. Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key when you want to add the two numbers together.</p><p>Line 17 is where the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method gets called into action. In fact, that's exactly how to describe it. This line of code calls the method.</p><p>Lines <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>20, 21, 22, and 23 make up the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method. Don't be concerned about the code details yet. I just want you to understand how calling a method works.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec32"></a>Method names are substitutes too</h3></div></div></div><p>You learned that <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>a variable is a substitute for the value it actually contains. Well, a method is no different.</p><p>Take a look at line 20 from the previous screenshot:</p><p>
<code class="literal">void AddTwoNumbers ()</code>
</p><p>The <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is the name of the method. Like a variable, <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is nothing more than a named placeholder in the memory, but this time it stores some lines of code instead. So anywhere we would like to use the code of this method in our script, just write <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code>, and the code will be substituted.</p><p>Line 21 has an opening curly-brace and line 23 has a closing curly-brace. Everything between the two curly-braces is the code that is executed when this method is called in our script.</p><p>Look at line 17 from the previous screenshot:</p><p>
<code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers();</code>
</p><p>The method name <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> is called. This means that the code between the curly-braces is executed.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>It's like having all of the code of a method right there on line 17.</p></div><p>Of course, this <a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method only has one line of code to execute, but a method could have many lines of code.</p><p>Line 22 is the action part of this method, the part between the curly-braces. This line of code is adding the two variables together and displaying the answer to the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. Then, follow the ensuing steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go back to Unity and have the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel showing.</p></li><li><p>Now click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec33"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>Oh no! Nothing happened!</p><p>Actually, as you sit<a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a> there looking at the blank <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel, the script is running perfectly, just as we programmed it. Line 16 in the script is waiting for you to press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key. Press it now.</p><p>And there you go! The following screenshot shows you the result of adding two variables together that contain the numbers 2 and 9:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586_02_06.jpg" /></div><p>Line 16 waited for you to press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key<a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>. When you do this, line 17 executes which calls the <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method. This allows the code block of the method, line 23, to add the the values stored in the variables <code class="literal">number1</code> and <code class="literal">number2</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec34"></a>Have a go hero – changing the output of the method</h3></div></div></div><p>While Unity is in the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> so its Components show in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, locate <span class="strong"><strong>Learning Script</strong></span> and its two variables. Change the values, currently <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>9</strong></span>, to different values. Make sure to click your mouse in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> panel so it has focus, then press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key again. You will see the result of the new addition in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>.</p><p>You just learned how a method works to allow a specific block of code to to be called to perform a task.</p><p>We didn't get into any of the wording details of methods here, this was just to show you fundamentally how they work. We'll get into the finer details of methods in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting into the Details of Methods</em></span>.</p></div></div>
