Just like I explained for variables, if you don't use good names, then six months from now you will be sad.</p><p>Since methods make GameObject do something useful, you should give your method a name that sounds like "action." For example, <code class="literal">JumpOverTheFence</code> or <code class="literal">ClimbTheWall</code>. You can look at those names and know exactly what the method is going to do.</p><p>Don't make them too simple. Suppose you name a method <code class="literal">Wiggle</code>. Sure you know what Wiggle means right now, but in six months you'll look at that and say "Wiggle? Wiggle what?" It only takes a moment to be a little more precise and write <code class="literal">WiggleMyButt</code>. Now when you see that method name, you'll know exactly what it's going to do.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec52"></a>Begin method names with an uppercase letter</h3></div></div></div><p>Why? We do this to<a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a> make it easier to tell the difference between what is a class or method, and what is a variable. Also, Microsoft suggests beginning<a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>method names</strong></span> with an <span class="strong"><strong>uppercase</strong></span> letter. If someone else ever looks at your code, they will expect to see<span class="strong"><strong> method names</strong></span> beginning with an <span class="strong"><strong>uppercase</strong></span> letter.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec53"></a>Using multi-word names for a method</h3></div></div></div><p>Using this example again:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void AddTwoNumbers ()
{
  // Code goes here
}</pre></div><p>You can see the name<a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a> is actually three words squished together. Since method names can only one word, the first word begins uppercase, then just capitalize the first letter of each additional word. For example, PascalCasing.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec54"></a>Parentheses are part of the method name</h3></div></div></div><p>The method<a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a> name always includes a pair of parentheses on the end. The parentheses not only let you know that the name is a method, but they do serve an important purpose of allowing you to input some data into the method when needed.</p></div></div>
