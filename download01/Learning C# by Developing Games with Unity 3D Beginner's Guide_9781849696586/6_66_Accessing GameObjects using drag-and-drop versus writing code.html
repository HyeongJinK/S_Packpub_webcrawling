It definitely has its uses, however, if it's not really necessary, I recommend assigning GameObjects in code.

It's your game though, so you can create it anyway you please. I'm just saying, don't go hog wild with drag-and-drop and then later wonder what it was you were trying to accomplish.</p></div></div>
