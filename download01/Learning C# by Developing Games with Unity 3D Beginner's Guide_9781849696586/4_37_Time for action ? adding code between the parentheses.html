We could possibly have hundreds of different combinations of "two numbers" to add together. This means that we need to let the method know, which two numbers need to be added together at the moment when we call the method.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>Using the<a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a> preceding screenshot, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> in MonoDevelop to modify it.</p></li><li><p>Add lines 6, 7, and 8 to declare three integer variables.</p></li><li><p>Add lines 22 to 26 to define the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method with parameters.</p></li><li><p>Add lines 12, 13, and 14 to call the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> three times.</p></li><li><p>Save the file.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> in Unity.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec57"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>As this script<a id="id90" class="indexterm"></a> executes, the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method is called three times on lines 12, 13, and 14. The method's code block adds two numbers and displays the result in the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> (see the yellow arrows in the following screenshot):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_04_02.jpg" /></div><p>Those parentheses are like a <span class="emphasis"><em>cubbyhole</em></span>. When we call <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> a couple of numbers are stuffed into the cubbyhole. When the code block executes, it takes those two numbers held in the cubbyhole and uses them on line 24.</p><p>There's a special name for that information between the parentheses of a method definition, such as line 22—the code is called the method parameters.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec58"></a>Specifying a method's parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>If you look up the <a id="id91" class="indexterm"></a>word parameters in the dictionary, your brain will probably seize up. All it means is that the method has to be able to use the information you send it, so you simply have to specify the type of data the method is allowed to use. That's it, it's very simple.</p><p>In the earlier screenshot, on line 22 the red arrows pointed to the type of the declared variables <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> and <code class="literal">secondNumber</code>. The type is <code class="literal">int</code>, or <code class="literal">integer</code>. Now notice the red arrow pointing to the variables <code class="literal">number1</code>, <code class="literal">number2</code>, and <code class="literal">number3</code>. They are also of the type <code class="literal">int</code>. These variables have to be of type <code class="literal">int</code> since they store the numbers that will be added in the method, which the parameters specify will be of type <code class="literal">int</code>.</p><p>So now go look in the dictionary again. You will probably see the word limit in there somewhere. That's what you did when you specified the type of data, an integer, that the method will use. You set some limits on what's allowed.</p><p>Ok, so you're setting parameters, or limits, on the type of data the method can use, but what exactly is a parameter? Well, the first parameter is called <code class="literal">firstNumber</code>, and what is <code class="literal">firstNumber</code> doing? It's storing a value that will be used in the code block on line 24. What do we call things that store data? That's right, variables. Variables are used everywhere.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember, a variable is just a substitute name for the value it actually stores.</p></div><p>As you can see <a id="id92" class="indexterm"></a>on line 22 of the code block, those variables are being added together.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec59"></a>How many parameters can a method have?</h3></div></div></div><p>We can have as many as you<a id="id93" class="indexterm"></a> need to make the method work properly.
