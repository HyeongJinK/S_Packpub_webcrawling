All the Component properties shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel are member variables in the Component's class. Member variables can be shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, or accessed by other scripts when the variable is declared as <code class="literal">public</code>. The type of data a variable can store is specified when it's declared. Finally, we learned that variable scope determines where it is allowed to be used.</p><p>Now that we've learned about variables, we're ready to learn the details of C# methods that will use the variables we create â€“ which is the topic of the next chapter.</p></div>
