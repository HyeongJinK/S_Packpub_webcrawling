For an overview of a topic we'll use the <span class="strong"><strong>Reference Manual</strong></span>. For specific coding details and examples we'll use the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>When you look at the code examples in the <a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>, they probably won't make sense to you, which is expected at this point. In the beginning chapters, as I teach you the basics of programming, it will be necessary for me to use a few things in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span> such as displaying some output to Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>.
