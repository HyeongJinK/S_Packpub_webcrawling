<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec34"></a>Declaring a variable and its type</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Every variable <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>we want to use in a script must be declared in a statement. What does that mean? Well, before Unity can use a variable; we have to tell Unity about it first. Ok then, what are we supposed to tell Unity about the variable?</p><p>There are only three absolute requirements for declaring a variable and they are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We have to specify the type of data a variable can store</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We have to provide a name for the variable</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We have to end the declaration statement with a semi-colon</p></li></ul></div><p>The following<a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a> is the syntax we use for declaring a variable:</p><p>
<code class="literal">typeOfData nameOfTheVariable;</code>
</p><p>Let's use one of the <a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">LearningScript</code> variables as an example; the following is how to declare a variable with the bare minimum requirements:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">int number1;</pre></div><p>The following is what we have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #1</strong></span> is the type of data that <code class="literal">number1</code> can store, which in this case is an <code class="literal">int</code>, meaning an integer</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #2</strong></span> is a name which is <code class="literal">number1</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Requirement #3</strong></span> is the semi-colon at the end</p></li></ul></div><p>The second requirement of naming a variable has already been discussed. The third requirement of ending a statement with a semi-colon has been discussed. The first requirement of specifying the type of data will be covered next.</p><p>The following is what we know about this bare minimum declaration as far as Unity is concerned:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p> There's no <code class="literal">public</code> modifier which means it's <code class="literal">private</code> by default</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p> It won't appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, or be accessible from other scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p> The value stored in <code class="literal">number1</code> defaults to zero</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec47"></a>The most common built-in variable types</h3></div></div></div><p>This section<a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a> only shows the most common built-in types of data that C# provides for us and that variables can store.</p><p>Just these basic<a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a> types are presented here so that you understand the concept of a variable being able to store only the type of the data you specify. The custom types of data that you will create later will be discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating the Gameplay is Just a Part of the Game</em></span> in the discussion of Dot Syntax.</p><p>The following chart shows the most common built-in types of data you will use in Unity:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_03_02.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"></a>Note</h3><p>There <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a>are few more built-in types of data that aren't shown in the preceding chart. However, once you understand the most common types, you'll have no problem looking up the other built-in types if you ever need to use them.</p></div><p>We know the <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>minimum requirements to declare a variable. However, we can add more information to a declaration to save our time and coding. We've already seen some examples in <code class="literal">LearningScript</code> of assigning values when the variable is being declared and now we'll see few more examples.</p></div></div>
