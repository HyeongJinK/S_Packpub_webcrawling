This usually means sending data to the method, which you just learned to do, then have the method return a value back. Previously, all you had the <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> method do was take the result of adding two numbers and display it to Unity's Console.</p><p>Now, instead of displaying the result directly, you're going to modify <code class="literal">AddTwoNumbers()</code> to return the result of the addition back to the place the method was called.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember, I told you that when you call a method, it's just a substitute for the code block that will be executed. It's like taking all the code in the method's code block and placing it right there where the method was called.</p></div><p>The next screenshot is <a id="id98" class="indexterm"></a>still very simple, but it shows how this substitution works and how returning a value from a method works.</p></div>
