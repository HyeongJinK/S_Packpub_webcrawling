These building blocks are used to create scripts and classes. Understanding how these building blocks work is critical so you don't feel you're not getting it.</p><p>We discovered that a variable name is a substitute for the value it stores; a method name is a substitute for a block of code; when a script or class is attached to a GameObject, it becomes a Component. The Dot Syntax is just like an address to locate GameObjects and Components.</p><p>With these concepts under your belt, we can proceed to learn the details of the sentence structure, the grammar, and the syntax used to work with variables, methods, and the Dot Syntax. In the next chapter we will learn about the details of using variables.</p></div>
