C# allows the flexibility to write and use regular class files as well as Unity script files. Also, we covered why I believe using a State Machine helps to organize a project.</p><p>Hopefully, this book will have helped you to totally understand the basics of C#. If so, you now have the ability to further your C# studies and you'll find it easier to understand the tutorials available on the Internet.</p><p>I hope I was able to help you overcome the perceived mountain of fear you may have had before reading this book. Remember, code is just a series of simple steps, so take one step at a time, just like climbing that mountain.</p></div>
