<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec71"></a>Applying your new coding skills to a State Machine</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>You learned the <a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a>fundamentals of C# coding in the<a id="id213" class="indexterm"></a> previous six chapters which were used for creating Components. You will use the same coding fundamentals to create a State Machine. You have learned in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Dot Syntax for Object Communication</em></span>, that an object created from a class is called an instance <a id="id214" class="indexterm"></a>of the class. In Unity, an object created from a class is called a Component. These terms may be different but they mean exactly the same; an object is created as defined by a class.</p><p>However, there is a <a id="id215" class="indexterm"></a>difference in the way the traditional C# <a id="id216" class="indexterm"></a>environment of the State Machine gets an instance object created, and the way Unity gets a component object created. The difference is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A class we write for Unity has to be attached to a GameObject. </p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A class we write for the State Machine is not attached to a GameObject.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity hides the code that is necessary to create an object. Unity knows to create the object because it's attached to a GameObject.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>For the State Machine, we have to write the code that is necessary to create an object.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note35"></a>Note</h3><p>Have no fear! It's very similar to the code in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Making Decisions in Code,</em></span> we used to create a <code class="literal">List</code> and <code class="literal">Dictionary</code> object.</p></div></div>
