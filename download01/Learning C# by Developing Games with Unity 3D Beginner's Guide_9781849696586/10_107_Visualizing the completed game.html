Of course, your assets will probably look different, but this chapter completes all the coding necessary to have a simple functioning game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849696586/graphics/6586OT_10_01.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note64"></a>Note</h3><p>This chapter is going to be structured slightly differently than the previous chapters. Instead of going through step-by-step instructions to add code to our classes and scripts, all the complete files of code can be found in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="appB">Appendix B</a>. I will simply reference the relevant code when doing a code flow analysis.</p></div></div>
