You<a id="id263" class="indexterm"></a> might be familiar with this word. Else go ahead and look it up in a dictionary. Right! Didn't help me much either.</p><p>Let's focus on some electronic devices as examples. For example, a game controller for a game console. The buttons, the shape, and so on, that's an interface. It's how you are allowed to interact with the game. How about a TV remote? That's an interface. It's how you are allowed to control the TV. How about a smartphone? A few buttons and a touch screen, perhaps some motion. That's an interface. That's how you are allowed to use the device.</p><p>How about the Unity game engine? Does it have an interface? Sure it does. It's right there on your computer screen. It's called the <span class="strong"><strong>User Interface</strong></span>.</p><p>There's another part of Unity that has an interface. It's called <a id="id264" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>.</p><p>What???</p><p>Sure, think about it. In order for your GameObjects to have certain behaviors, you have to use the classes available in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scripting Reference</strong></span>. You have certain variables and methods in each class available for you to use. That's an interface, a programmer's interface. Even more technical, it's called an <a id="id265" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Application Programming Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>API</strong></span>).</p><p>Every time you create a script, you get to control whether a variable is private or public. If you make it public, you have stated that the variable is an interface on that class. It even appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, which is another interface.</p><p>How about methods? If it's public, then it's an interface point that can be used from other classes.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec111"></a>The State Machine and the interface guarantee</h3></div></div></div><p>All States have to<a id="id266" class="indexterm"></a> incorporate <a id="id267" class="indexterm"></a>particular methods that the <code class="literal">StateManger</code> class can call. Therefore, the States have to guarantee that these methods are implemented, otherwise the State Machine won't work.</p><p>Well, since you write the code for your classes, can't you just remember and make sure these required methods are implemented on each State? Sure, that's possible, but it's not a guarantee, is it? Suppose your game has ten possible States. There's just too much room for spelling mistakes, or just plain forgetting to implement the required methods.</p><p>C# does have a way to <a id="id268" class="indexterm"></a>guarantee that the required methods are <a id="id269" class="indexterm"></a>implemented in each State by using a C# <code class="literal">interface</code>. I know, I've been using the general word interface a lot here, but that's what it's called, an <code class="literal">interface</code>.</p></div></div>
