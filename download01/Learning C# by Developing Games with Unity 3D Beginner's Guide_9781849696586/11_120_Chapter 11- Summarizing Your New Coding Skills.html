<span class="emphasis"><em>When you initially started with this book, all the little details about programming looked like a treacherous mountain to climb. Every step up the mountain was perceived as the one that would just be too difficult to take. Learning to write C# code looked nearly impossible to learn. Not because each step is difficult, but because it looked like a mountain of information to overcome. Then the journey began and a funny thing happened along the way. Each step became just another step. Before long, the top was reached and the goal was accomplished. All that initial fear and worry was nothing more than overzealous imagination.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>Now that the top is reached, we'll turn around and look at the new skills you just learned, and mention some things that weren't learned during your hike up this mountain.</em></span>
