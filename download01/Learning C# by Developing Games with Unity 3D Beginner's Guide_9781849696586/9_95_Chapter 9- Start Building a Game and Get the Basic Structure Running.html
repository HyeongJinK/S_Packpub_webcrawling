<span class="emphasis"><em>Everything you've learned in this book up to this point has mostly been about getting to know C#, and how to use it at a relatively basic level. Unity has been used more like a helper to explain C#. The next step is to focus more on using Unity's features and let C# play the supporting role. Our goal is to tap into Unity's built-in features using your new ability to write and read C# code, in order to use the variables and methods of Unity's classes provided and documented in the Scripting Reference.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Scripting Reference provides all the keys to providing GameObjects with action and response behaviors. Over the next two chapters, we will be adding scripts to GameObjects to create a simple game. The game itself is very basic to demonstrate how to use C# and the Scripting Reference to code some of the common game features and GameObject behaviors.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we'll dig into the Scripting Reference some more to write the code for changing levels or Scenes, rotating Player using the Transform class, setting the Player color and specifying number of Lives that Player will have before losing the game. All of this while under the control of the State Machine.</em></span>
