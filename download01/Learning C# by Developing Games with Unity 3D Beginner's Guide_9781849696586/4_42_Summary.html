The parentheses are part of a method's name. We also learned how to call a method into action, how to use data returned from a method, and that Unity calls some methods automatically, such as the <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> methods, when the script inherits from the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> class.</p><p>You now know the two major building blocks of scripting, variables and methods. From now on, everything else you do will just be making use of variables and methods. Now that you understand these two building blocks, you are ready for the next chapter that deals with making decisions in your code.</p></div>
