Both of them have their pros and cons, and the choice to use one or the other is usually based on the needs of the project. For instance, if we want to create a basic role playing game, where a character is expected to be able to walk, fight, run, and interact with treasure chests, we would recommend using the Character Controller component. The character is not going to be affected by physical forces, and the Character Controller component gives us the ability to go up slopes and stairs without the need to add extra code. Sounds amazing, doesn't it? There is one caveat. The Character Controller component becomes useless if we decide to make our character non-humanoid. If our character is a dragon, spaceship, ball, or a piece of gum, the Character Controller component won't know what to do with it.</p><p>It's not programmed for those entities and their behavior. So, if we want our character to swing across the pit with his whip and dodge traps by rolling over his shoulder, the Character Controller component will cause us many problems.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692304/graphics/2304EXP_02_01.jpg" /></div><p>In this chapter, we will look into the creation of a character that is greatly affected by physical forces, therefore, we will look into the creation of a custom <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span> <a id="id138" class="indexterm"></a>with <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span>, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</p></div>
