We hope that you have come away with at least a better understanding of how to go about tackling the preparation and implementation of these game components.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will cover creating a custom Character Controller with an explanation for implementing animations and a camera rig system, which will allow you to change between a first-person view, a shoulder view, and a bird's eye/third-person view at the press of a button. Please continue to enjoy the book and we await you in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Character</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Controller</em></span>, to learn about animations and camera rigs.</p></div>
