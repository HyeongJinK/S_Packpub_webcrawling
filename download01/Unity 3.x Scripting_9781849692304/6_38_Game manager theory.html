In reality, this simple question has a simple answer; the game managers help us to organize our work. For more efficient use, we can create managers to control the behavior of a particular part of the game such as the HUD, save/load system, mission management, and so on. As we create content for the game, it starts to grow and keeping track of every single function, class, and object becomes a very difficult task. To simplify navigation, we will put all the related functionality into separate managers, which makes it easier to find and keep track of in the future.</p></div>
