Is it a single-person puzzler, a <span class="strong"><strong>first-person</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>) <a id="id972" class="indexterm"></a>with a campaign, a <span class="strong"><strong>third-person</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TPS</strong></span>) <a id="id973" class="indexterm"></a>action adventure, a fighter, or a <span class="strong"><strong>real-time</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>strategy</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>RTS</strong></span><a id="id974" class="indexterm"></a>)? Each of these can, and usually do, have a form of <span class="strong"><strong>Artificial</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>)<a id="id975" class="indexterm"></a>. There are many forms of AI that can present themselves and they appear in many ways such as pathfinding, collision detection, item collection, cover, animations, and so on. Pretty much everything that we take for granted being humans, and can do in a game without thinking about it, has to be carefully thought about and crafted to work together as if the humans were indeed in control of the AI. So, with such a huge and complex topic to explore and present, the best and most useful aspect is to show an example of enemies with behaviors and waypoint path navigation. First we will explore setting up the basic waypoint pathfinding without behaviors.</p><p>In this chapter we will look into the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pathfinding with waypoints</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing a pathfinding script for robots</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Making robots shoot and interact with a player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing stats scripts for robots</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Teaching AI different kinds of behaviors</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849692304/graphics/2304_07_01.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>Let's get started.</p></div>
