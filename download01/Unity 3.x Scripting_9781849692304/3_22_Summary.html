We saw how animations can be brought into Unity and then, from there, their manipulation. We hope that you saw that animation manipulation in Unity is no small feat. Further on, tethering was explained in as simple a system that could be devised. Lastly, we have the soft body projectiles that are a lot of fun to play with. There is much functionality that can be added into each toolset and we hope that you will take what has been shown, and expand and explore it. In the next chapter, we will cover the basics of creating <span class="strong"><strong>role-playing games</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>RPGs</strong></span>) inventory with <span class="strong"><strong>graphical user interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>).</p></div>
