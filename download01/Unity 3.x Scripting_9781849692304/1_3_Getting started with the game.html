The first chapter is dedicated to creating a simple platform game. We will learn to use the built-in functionality of Unity to set up our character, and use the Character Controller component to make that character move and be controlled with our commands. Later in the chapter, we will get into creating a playground for our character. We will also get into teaching him to move boxes around, script moving platforms, create custom triggers, and make huge explosions.</p></div>
