A person should be able to identify aspects of what needs to go into designing systems for AI to work. In this chapter, we explored concepts such as identifying the path that the enemy should navigate along, how the enemy should react at the end of a waypoint array, how behaviors can help expand and enrich the player's experience, and bring some challenge to enemies. We saw how tweaking values can give us different battle situations, and therefore, if we have a simple battle setup for bots, it is very doable and easy to accomplish for the player.</p><p>As mentioned throughout this book, these concepts and principles that are being shown are merely the basics and they are very simple. In order to truly get results, whether it be AI, tethering, cameras, or controllers, there is a more sophisticated way that allows for optimization and more freedom with the code. This is merely a gateway. I am hoping you want to learn more and explore the boundaries of Unity and then surpass them.
