In this chapter, we will look into the creation of a drag-and-drop inventory that will allow us to customize our character, control his statistics and equipment, and show information about the current amount of money. In this example, we will utilize GUI to get the visuals on to the screen. However, due to multiple limitations of GUI, we can't rely on them to create drag-and-drop functionality.
