<div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05"></a>Chapter 5. Dynamic GUI</h2></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will be going over several types of <span class="strong"><strong>graphical</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>user</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span><a id="id593" class="indexterm"></a>). The GUI is extremely important for the user to find out what is going on and to be given visual feedback on their inputs. The GUI elements that will be covered are score display, objective display, pickup display, and arch targeting.</p><p>Several of these elements have multiple parts and work in unison with others, so it is important to have an understanding of GUI and the way these parts interact with each other slowly. It is easy to get lost and confused in the logic of setting up the GUI.</p><p>With that being said, let's now begin. The first GUI element to be explored is <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>heads</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>up</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span><a id="id594" class="indexterm"></a>). We will perform the following actions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will create a circular health bar</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will write scripts for item and weapon selection</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will discuss text meshes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will create the scoring system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We will save/read and build an arch targeting system</p></li></ul></div><p>As stated previously, some of the GUIs have multiple parts. When it comes to HUD, there are usually several parts that can be taken into consideration. Those parts in our case are the display of health, armor, items, weapons, change camera mode, and saved score display. We will tackle these one at a time starting with health.</p></div>
