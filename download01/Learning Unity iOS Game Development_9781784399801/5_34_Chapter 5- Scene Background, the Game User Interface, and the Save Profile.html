For the game, we will display a unit number that represents how far the player has moved and keep a tally of how many coins the player has picked up. We will also display a restart button the user can tap when they die, restarting the game loop.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing a C# script that will move the background image layers to make the character look as if it is moving more realistically through the game world</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the game user interface with the Unity 5 UI system that will display the distance traveled by the character and how many coins they have collected</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using the UI system, create a button that will display when the player dies, allowing them to restart playing</p></li></ul></div></div>
