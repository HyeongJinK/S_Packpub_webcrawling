I know that if you are new to game design, Unity, or programming, you will probably be overwhelmed. The best advice I can give you is that if you keep at it and try to learn something every day, before you know it, you will be able to create just about anything you want. Remember to keep your ideas within the scope of what you can manage. It is very often that a beginner game designer wants to create an AAA-equivalent game, and when they dive into it, they are completely lost and confused. Keeping yourself in check is how you get to the point where you can eventually create the game you dream about playing.</p></div>
