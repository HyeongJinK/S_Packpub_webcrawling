Unlike most other devices for gaming, mobile devices are not designed to take input (such as traditional gaming systems) and are instead in the spectrum of an entertainment device, meaning they are not solely used to play games. This means that we have to observe how the player is going to interact with the game differently as compared to devices specific to gaming—which have either dedicated or what you'd call standard input schemes that allow the player to have a pleasing experience.</p><p>The most successful games on the mobile platform do one thing well: they give the player a simple and responsive input. For example, games focused on puzzles such as connect three items of one type in a row by swiping types between each other, a slot machine, and casino games, which require the touch of a single button, or even the more complex games (such as the endless runner) where the player can control the game with taps and swipes that have a much better chance of being successful than a game that uses arrows or joysticks to move and multiple buttons to cause the character to do something. It's not to say that you can't have complex movement of the character in a game; it is more to say that if you do, solve the issue with the most basic input scheme possible.</p><p>For the game in this book, the only input will be of a swipe. The player will swipe to have the character on screen to jump. If on a wall, jump to another wall, continue forward, or swipe down. Swiping down while already jumping will also cause the character to fall to the ground faster.</p><p>For the sake of teaching, the code represented in this chapter will also detect when the player taps on the screen. This is included here in the hope of teaching you how to include different types of input if you were to make another game after following along with the instructions here.</p><p>To sum up, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How Unity uses their <code class="literal">Touch</code> struct, and how we will use it to create our own struct called <code class="literal">SimpleTouch</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using the same technique to take in the mouse input so that we can test the game in the editor</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How the character on screen will know what the input is doing?</p></li></ul></div></div>
