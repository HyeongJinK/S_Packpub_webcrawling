We will also display iAds if the player has not purchased the remove iAds.</p><p>Similar to the last chapter, this one will have a fair bit of the tedious UI work. As it is difficult to explain the workflow, I will give you the exact locations and anchor points for the UI buttons and images. These locations are not definitive, meaning you can change them however you feel. Also, it won't affect the players experience with the UI because the logic for them is based in code. Feel free to take the liberty with the UI design if you are comfortable with it.</p><p>iAds, Leaderboards, and Achievements are all handled with the iOS plugin. Sadly, Unity has not integrated the native iOS functionality into the engine, and the iOS plugin is required to call the setting and get information for leaderboards and achievements and when and how to display the iAds. As I mentioned in the first chapter, I will use the plugin called IOS Native. It is on the Unity asset store for <span class="emphasis"><em>twenty</em></span> dollars. If you do not want to spend that much money, there are some other options, although I have found that IOS Native is one of the better ones.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip37"></a>Tip</h3><p>There are many alternatives to IOS Native. All of them have different methods to do the same thing at different costs. If for whatever reason you would like to use another or want to see the alternatives, you can use the Unity Asset Store to find them.</p></div><p>We will also need to expand our existing class in order to fill the gaps to save information regarding achievements, leaderboards, and store purchases. Apple also requires a restore purchase option.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building the main menu user interface with Unity's UI tools, including buttons for achievements, leaderboards, and store purchases</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Displaying iAds on the screen if the player has not purchased remove iAds</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing code that hides and shows different aspects of the UI, such as the transition between the main menu and the game, any call needed for store purchases, or bringing up the iOS leaderboard and achievement scenes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Addition to <code class="literal">LevelPieceManager</code> so that the character continues to run on a flat ground until the player chooses to start playing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Addition to character and saving the system so that it can check whether achievements are completed</p></li></ul></div></div>
