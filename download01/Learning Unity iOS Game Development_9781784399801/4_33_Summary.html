These were laid out by the size of the sprites you chose and were flexible enough to use with your own settings. We also created prefabs for all of our bigger GameObjects, which could hold all of their components in a neat package. Finally, we wrapped up the gameplay by having the <code class="literal">LevelPiece</code> and <code class="literal">LevelPieceManager</code> code move, piece together, and reset all the active GameObjects, so the player can't even tell what is going on.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will explore the Unity UI system and start to piece together the UI so that the player can see the score of the game and also handle what happens when the player dies. We will also finish the final portions of the game level by having an animated background to give the game a more diverse feel.</p></div>
