Generally, games see many iterations of bug fixes and changes before submitting or even after submitting the game to the Apple Store. To aid this process, Apple does have a service called <span class="strong"><strong>test flight.</strong></span> You can use this service by first navigating to your iTunes Connect account and then navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Users and Roles</strong></span>. Here, you can set up the Test Flight users who can then download the <code class="literal">TestFlight</code> app, so they will be alerted and will be able to test the game that you are creating.</p><p>You can even hire QA groups to play and test your game. Alternatively, you can use many forums to ask people to test. Feedback is a huge part of creating a quality product. It is highly advised that you find an avenue to get the said feedback from as many people as possible.</p><p>It can be difficult to be objective when you create a game because you are the one writing every line of code and putting together all the aspects of the game, making the viewpoint of the experience of playing it very different from a person who has never seen it before. Bigger studios even use focus test groups, where they hire a group of people to come to the studio and play the alpha and beta versions of the game so that they can see how people react and play. A lot <a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a>can be said about a person getting confused or bored when playing your game. Also, you can find valuable information on how to fix such issues.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec53"></a>I want to learn more about programming</h3></div></div></div><p>Again, as this is an entry-level book, there are many aspects of the code that can be viewed as an inefficient practice.

This attention to detail is ever evolving, and you will have to continue to find better methods to write the code you want so that the iOS devices can perform at their best efficiency. Programming for iOS devices is a challenging feat because these devices have limited hardware that needs code that pay attention to how these devices manage running games.</p><p>The Unity editor ships with a profiling tool. This tool tells you how much memory is being used and how well your game is running from the Unity editor. To access this tool, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> drop-down menu and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>A fine tutorial on <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>memory management using C# in Unity is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/WendelinReich/20131109/203841/C_Memory_Management_for_Unity_Developers_part_1_of_3.php" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/WendelinReich/20131109/203841/C_Memory_Management_for_Unity_Developers_part_1_of_3.php</a>.</p></div></div></div>
