<span class="strong"><strong>Collider 2D</strong></span> component will give our character a bounding box that will interact with the world around it. This means that if the character hits <a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a>another GameObject that also has <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span>, we will be able to use code to know about it. This is imperative to the interaction of the character with the game world since without it, we wouldn't have the information needed to do things, such as collect pick-ups, or know when the character hit something dangerous, such as the obstacles.</p><p>Just as Rigidbody 2D, the Box Collider 2D component is easy to set up.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With the <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span> GameObject selected, navigate to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Search for <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>By default, <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> will fit itself around the image. As our image is 32 x 32 pixels wide and high by default, the collider will match it as it is also 32 x 32 pixels wide and high. To make it fit our character better, change the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> down to <code class="literal">0.22</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399801/graphics/B04063_03_11.jpg" /></div><p>This area is the basis of our character. It will simulate gravity, collide with anything else that is representative of a collider, and take in any sort of force we want to give it, such as changing its velocity when the player swipes on the mobile device.</p><p>In order to test <a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>our changes, we will need to create a temporary floor that will prevent the character from falling forever.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, right-click and select <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select the new empty GameObject and in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Search for <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>With GameObject still selected, change the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> as <code class="literal">50</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>We will also need to position the character in the world correctly. To perform this, start by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span> GameObject.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, change its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component to <code class="literal">0</code> on<span class="strong"><strong> X</strong></span>, <code class="literal">0</code> on <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <code class="literal">0</code> on <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>. This will put the character in the very center of our game world.</p></li><li><p>Next, select the empty GameObject that is representative of the temporary floor.</p></li><li><p>In its <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> as <code class="literal">0</code> on<span class="strong"><strong> X</strong></span>, <code class="literal">-1</code> on <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <code class="literal">0</code> on <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>. This will put a collider just after <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span>, preventing it from falling.</p></li><li><p>To have a better view of <span class="strong"><strong>Character</strong></span>, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> GameObject in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab. In <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> as <code class="literal">1</code>. If <span class="strong"><strong>Camera Projectile</strong></span> isn't set to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>, make sure it is set to this.</p></li></ol></div><p>If you play the <a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a>game now, you will see the character fall a little and then stop and run in place. If you don't see this, make sure to revisit the preceding steps.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If the character isn't falling, make sure that you have Rigidbody 2D on it.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If the character isn't playing our running animation or is playing the wrong animation, make sure to check whether the controller is correctly assigned and set up.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If the character doesn't have a sprite, view <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> to make sure that a sprite is assigned.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If the character is falling forever, make sure to navigate to the temporary floor we made and Box Collider 2D to verify that it is present and sized correctly.
