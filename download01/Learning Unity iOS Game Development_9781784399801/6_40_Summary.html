Feel free to explore these features and add to them. Adding more store purchases, achievements, and leaderboards is simply repeating the steps that we have already done.</p><p>When you get used to the workflow, the system can be set up to be fairly easy to manipulate to do what you want to do.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at how to create builds with Xcode on your Macintosh computer. This way, you will be able to run the game and test the features that we have completed.</p></div>
