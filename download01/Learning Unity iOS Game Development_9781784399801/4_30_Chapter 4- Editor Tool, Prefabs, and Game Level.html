The player has the ability to send input to the device, and we will handle this by manipulating the player character GameObject. We also set up some game logic so that the player character can interact with positive and negative world objects, such as <code class="literal">Coins</code> and <code class="literal">Obstacles</code>. To further develop the sense of a complete game, we need to create the pieces of the game world that represent a floor that the player will run on.</p><p>To create these pieces, we will create a Unity <code class="literal">EditorWindow</code> class that will help us create grids that will represent the ground the player runs on and the dirt below it. Traditionally, you would have to place each sprite one at a time. With this editor tool, we will be able to create bigger boxes in a grid based on our settings.</p><p>After we have our editor tool running, we will begin to create the prefabs that will hold multiple GameObjects and their components in a single file. Finally, we will write the code needed to move the floor and ground pieces below the player character, simulating the character as running forward.</p><p>To summarize, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Writing a Unity C# class that extends <code class="literal">EditorWindow</code>, which allows you to input settings and sprite files that will give you a box grid and simplify the level pieces creation.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating the game-related prefabs so that you have grouped files in an easy-to-use file.</p></li></ul></div><p>Use the prefabs we made in the C# script. This will move the level pieces of prefabs under the player character, simulating movement.</p></div>
