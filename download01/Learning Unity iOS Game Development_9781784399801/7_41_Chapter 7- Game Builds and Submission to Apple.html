The most important thing is that any application for the iOS / Apple Store needs to be compiled on a Macintosh computer with Xcode. You will not be able to submit the game without a Macintosh computer and Xcode. This is a requirement from Apple, and there isn't any solution to get around it. You also need the newest version of Xcode, which comes with the current version of OS X.</p><p>If you do not own a Macintosh or do not have access to one, you will not be able to submit your game to Apple. This restriction can be a bit frustrating and expensive, but it is part of the cost when you create games for iOS.</p><p>The first step is to download the most recent Xcode version. If you already have Xcode, you can get any updates through the Application Manager on your Macintosh machine. If you do not have Xcode, you can also use the Application Manager to download it. As of now, the most recent version of Xcode is version 6.4 and is free of charge for any OS X Yosemite user.</p><p>The next step is to create the build for the game. Although it is possible to create a build on a Windows machine and transfer files to a Macintosh, it requires several extra steps and many more solutions to problems. It is more easily solved by simply building the game on a Macintosh. Although the steps to create the build are the same for Windows and Macintosh, the transferring process creates many unique and different challenges that is not possible for me to plan for. Therefore, I cannot help you with it.</p><p>If you are able to download and install Unity 5 on your Macintosh machine, transfer the Unity project folder to your Macintosh machine before you create any build. I will use <span class="strong"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> to keep the <a id="id436" class="indexterm"></a>version of my games. This makes the transferring process very easy because I am able to download the same files on my Windows and Macintosh machine.</p><p>GitHub is a version control tool that is exceptionally easy to use and set up. There are many tools that can help you use GitHub; I recommend you to use a program called Source Tree, which can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/</a>.</p></div>
