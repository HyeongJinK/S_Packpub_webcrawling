When you create 3D models for an iOS game, it is important to follow a couple of rules.</p><p>Make the mesh as low detailed as possible, although it should still be pleasant to look at. The more triangles the mesh has, the more difficult it is for the device to render it.</p><p>Use as few materials as possible. Similar to all devices, each object is rendered to the screen on each frame. The more objects you have, the more time is spent rendering them. For iOS games, the objects being rendered are called <span class="strong"><strong>draw calls</strong></span>. The fewer draw calls you have, the better the game will run. If you have too many draw calls, the devices will use too much memory and/or take too long to render, which will either outright crash the game with an <span class="emphasis"><em>out of memory</em></span> message or start to render at lower frames-per-second, making the game appear slower than it should be.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec54"></a>3D programs</h3></div></div></div><p>Many mobile games are in 3D and require the use a 3D modeling program. A common free option is called <span class="strong"><strong>Blender</strong></span>.</p><p>You can find more information about Blender at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">https://www.blender.org/</a>.</p><p>Another option is from Autodesk. This has both Maya and 3D Studio Max. Both cost money, have month-to-month licensing plans, and allows you to pay for a commercially acceptable license <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>over a smaller period of time. Refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview" target="_blank">http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview</a> for more information on Maya.</p><p>You can find <a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a>more information about 3Ds Max at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview" target="_blank">http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview</a>.</p><p>All of these 3D programs also offer animation tools, such as creating skeletons and handling of animation controls. Animation is well documented online. Also, there are many video tutorial series for each of these programs on how to animate a static 3D model.</p><p>These programs also provide you tools for UV mapping, which is the process of taking faces of the model and laying them out in a flat sheet to make textures fit the mesh correctly. UV mapping is well documented online. Also, a Google search will give you literally thousands of resources on how to do it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec55"></a>Creating textures</h3></div></div></div><p>A commonly used <a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a>option is a program called Photoshop created by Adobe. Adobe provides a license for Photoshop that is very cheap; currently, it is $9.99 a month for Photoshop and Lightroom.</p><p>You can find more information about Photoshop at <a class="ulink" href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans?promoid=KSPAK" target="_blank">https://creative.adobe.com/plans?promoid=KSPAK</a>.</p><p>Photoshop tutorials have a massive presence online. You can also find many excellent resources through a Google search.</p><p>Two more resources on how to make textures a bit easier are DDO/NDO (created by Quixel) and Substance Painter / Substance Designer (created by Allegorithmic).</p><p>You can find more <a id="id474" class="indexterm"></a>information about DDO/NDO at <a class="ulink" href="http://quixel.se/dev/ddo" target="_blank">http://quixel.se/dev/ddo</a>.</p><p>Refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-live" target="_blank">https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-live</a> for more information on <span class="strong"><strong>substance tools</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
