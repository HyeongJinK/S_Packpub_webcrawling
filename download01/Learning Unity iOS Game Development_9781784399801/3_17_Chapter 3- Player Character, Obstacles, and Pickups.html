In the game we're creating, it will be quite simple. Our character will be designed to perform only three things: change its direction based on the swipe input of the user, collide with pickups in the world, and collide with obstacles in the world.</p><p>The swipe direction will determine the direction the character will move and with how much force it will move. The collision with pickups will add to a collection of points for the user. Also, the collision with obstacles will "kill" the character and end the game.</p></div>
