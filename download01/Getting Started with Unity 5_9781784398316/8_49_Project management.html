<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec48"></a>Project management</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>When developing <a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a>games in Unity, you'll want to ensure you have a project management plan mapped. The adage of <span class="emphasis"><em>the larger the team, the greater the need</em></span>, is certainly appropriate for developing with Unity. As you've seen with our <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span> game, the number of assets in even a small project can quickly add up. If you are an indie developer, you do not need to be overly concerned about project <a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a>management, but if you have two more people on your team, I recommend taking a few moments to determine your project's workflow.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec58"></a>Unity workflow</h3></div></div></div><p>There is no ideal or perfect <a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a>workflow for working with Unity. Every team does things a bit differently. So, instead of suggesting a specific workflow, I'll mention a few important parts of any workflow and suggest methods of approaching them.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec33"></a>Art and animation</h4></div></div></div><p>Typically, the team members <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>that work on art and animation are different from those that write the scripts. It stands to reason that the art and animation team (or teams) should be able to progress with their work while developers are scripting. We can, for example, work on scripting a game's inventory control system without actual item graphics. We can easily create cubes and spheres as temporary or placeholder issues while the art team finalizes their models. This permits two processes to occur simultaneously.</p><p>With this example, there would need to be a way for the development team to know when the new art/models are ready. Use of a project management tool such as JIRA or BaseCamp can help. Also, if you are using Unity Pro, you'll have access to <span class="strong"><strong>Team License</strong></span>, formerly known as <a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Asset Server</strong></span>. This feature is an asset and version control system. To use the system, you'll need to download additional software from the Unity website, install the software on a server or computer with network access, and administer the system. If you are interested in this, you can learn more from the Unity documentation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec34"></a>Scripts</h4></div></div></div><p>If you have more than one <a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a>person working on scripts, you will want to keep your scripts in a central location for easy access. You can use the tools previously mentioned in this chapter or something as simple as an online file storage system that supports versioning.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec35"></a>Other assets</h4></div></div></div><p>It is important for everyone <a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a>on the project's team to understand where assets are stored and what their naming conventions are. Implementing a standardized naming convention for assets is a great way to embed organization. Relying on file extensions is often not sufficient. You can poll your team to determine what will work best.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec59"></a>Scaling projects</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity has a reputation as being a <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>great game engine for indie developers and small game projects. This is somewhat of a bad rap. Unity can be used for large-scale projects. As with using any other game engine, several issues that need to be addressed include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>File management</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Asset management</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level control</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Build documentation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Data backups</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Milestones</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Version control</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
