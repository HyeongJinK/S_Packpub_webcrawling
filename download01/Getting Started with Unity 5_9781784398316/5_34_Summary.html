You gained a cursory understanding of C# fundamentals including syntax and naming conventions. You were guided through the use of MonoDevelop so that you can edit scripts by using the code editor that comes with Unity. The chapter provided insights on how to create scripts and how to attach them to game objects. Using a hands-on approach, you were guided through the creation of your first C# script in our game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll add a graphic user interface to our game. We'll explore Unity 5's new UI system. We will create and script a full-screen navigational menu, a heads-up display, and a minimap. By the end of the next chapter, you will have created a professional-looking game with a full set of graphic user interface features.</p></div>
