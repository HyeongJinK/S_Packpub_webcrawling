You gained an appreciation of the importance of GUIs in games we create. As you've learned, there are different types and functions of GUIs. You gained hands-on experience with creating a HUD and a mini-map. You also learned how to create a scene to handle the game's initial load. You walked through the steps of creating a clickable button and scripted the button to load a scene other than the current one. Most importantly, you achieved a level of confidence in creating GUI elements and referencing them in scripts.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at ways to give our game some final touches. Specifically, we'll add sound effects to breathe life into our game. We'll add shadows to make the game look more realistic. We'll even create some special lighting effects. Our next chapter is about more than just polishing the game; it also contains ways to optimize our game through rendering options and code optimization.</p></div>
