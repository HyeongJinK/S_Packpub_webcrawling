A great approach to script optimization is to simply code your game and run it with the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window open and select <a id="id315" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>CPU Usage</strong></span> tab from the left pane, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_07_22.jpg" /></div><p>Using this view, you can see what processes are taking the most CPU power. The visual graph makes it easy to spot significant jumps in CPU usage. The <span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span> section, which can be found below the visual graph, provides a very detailed view of how much CPU processing is allocated to each object and process.</p><p>Another section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window is the <span class="strong"><strong>Memory</strong></span> tab. Reviewing that tab's information can tell you how much memory is allocated, how much system memory is used, and counts of <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Meshes</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>AnimationClips</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>AudioClips</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_07_23.jpg" /></div><p>Once we know<a id="id316" class="indexterm"></a> where our problems or potential issues are, we can do a few things to optimize our scripts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We can destroy objects that we no longer need with <code class="literal">Destroy(theGameObject)</code>. Of course, if you intend to reuse the object, think twice about destroying it, as it will take additional processing and can, in some circumstances, result in game lag.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If we have an object that we need to exist but it does not currently hold a value, we can set the value to null with <code class="literal">theGameObject = null</code>.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are other, more advanced techniques to optimize Unity scripts. There is a nice section of the online Unity Manual that references this.</p></div>
