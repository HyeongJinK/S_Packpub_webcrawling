We explored Unity's capabilities to help us manage audio with audio listeners, audio clips, and audio sources. We put our new knowledge into practice and add two sound effects to our game: pigs crying and a "points" sound that is played when our game character picks up an item. We looked at visual effects included implementing a spotlight orb with halo, casting shadows, and trail rendering.</p><p>We also looked at how to optimize our game with <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> settings. You were introduced to Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window and how to read the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span>, CPU usage, and memory data. You learned about rendering optimization and the specific techniques of imposing limits and baking images.</p><p>Lastly, we looked at script optimization to ensure our game performs well.</p><p>In the next, final chapter, we'll look at what you can do to improve our <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span> game, the Unity workflow, how to scale projects, physics with collisions, and some cross-platform considerations. We'll also look at a few advanced topics including versioning control and file management.</p></div>
