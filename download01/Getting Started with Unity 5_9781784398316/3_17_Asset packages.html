<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec21"></a>Asset packages</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In the last chapter, we imported an asset package so that we could create and modify our game's terrain. In this section, we'll look at what these packages are and how we'll use them in Unity<a id="id111" class="indexterm"></a> and for our game.</p><p>Asset packages are bundles of assets grouped together. We can create packages to share our assets with others or to save them for use in another game or Unity application. We can even create asset bundles to sell in Unity's Asset Store.</p><p>To create an <a id="id112" class="indexterm"></a>asset package, you simply select all the assets you want in the package, using the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view. Then you have two options. Your first option is to right-click and select <span class="strong"><strong>Export Package</strong></span>. The second option is to navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Export Package</strong></span>. Both options result in the same outcome.</p><p>In addition to the ability to export packages from Unity, we can also import asset packages into Unity. To import an asset package, we simply navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> menu option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_04.jpg" /></div><p>When importing<a id="id113" class="indexterm"></a> asset packages, we can select from one of the 12 asset packages that ship from Unity. These packages are listed when the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> menu is selected, as shown in the following screenshot. Selecting one of these packages to import results in Unity decompressing the package, then displaying the package contents to you:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_05.jpg" /></div><p>After the package has been decompressed and before the assets in that package are imported into your <a id="id114" class="indexterm"></a>Unity project, you have the opportunity to review, select, and deselect assets in the package. Once you have the desired packages selected, you simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button. Unity will place the package in your project. You'll be able to see the assets in <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view.</p><p>The actual files are stored in your project's folder hierarchy in the same file/folder structure you saw when you reviewed the assets prior to importing them. This makes things easy to find.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>Be sure not to move assets using your computer's file and folder system. Relocating assets outside of Unity can result in linkage problems for your project. You can move things around from within Unity in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view with no consequences.</p></div><p>We also have the option to import a <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package</strong></span> option by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> menu selection. When this option is selected, you'll be presented with a dialog window so you can indicate where on your computer the package is. The file extension for <a id="id115" class="indexterm"></a>Unity packages is <code class="literal">.unitypackage</code>.</p></div>
