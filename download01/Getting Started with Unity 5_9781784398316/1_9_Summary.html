We also took a closer look at Unity and reviewed some of its key features. We downloaded and installed Unity so that we're ready to start developing games. We discussed Unity projects and created one in order to become comfortable with the process. To close out the chapter, we walked through the Unity interface including looking at layouts, views, transform tools, and cameras.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll start designing the game we'll be making through this book and you'll learn how to create the game environment.</p></div>
