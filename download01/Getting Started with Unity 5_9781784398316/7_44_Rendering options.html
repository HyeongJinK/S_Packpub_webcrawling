In other words, creating a visual presentation. Depending on your game, this can be a lot of work for the Unity engine. We can keep our eye on this by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> from the top menu. This brings up the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec52"></a>The Profiler window</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id307" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window gives us a view of CPU usage, rendering, memory, audio, physics, and physics (2D). Reviewing these areas can help us determine how our game is performing and where there are potential areas to optimize. We'll focus on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> section:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_07_19.jpg" /></div><p>You can switch between any of these Profiler areas. To look <a id="id308" class="indexterm"></a>at <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span>, select that from the left pane of the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window. When you put the game in play mode and start navigating the world, the Rendering area of the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window will start to populate, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_07_20.jpg" /></div><p>In addition to the color-coded <a id="id309" class="indexterm"></a>charting that happens on the top portion of the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> window, very specific rendering information is provided in text format in the bottom section.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec53"></a>Rendering optimization</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a few things that we can do to decrease the processing <a id="id310" class="indexterm"></a>overhead related to rendering during game play. Perhaps the most important concept is that realism is costly. We might want to create the most photo-realistic game, and Unity can help us do that. Some of the problems we are likely to run into are game file size, lag, and hardware constraints, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>File size might only be an issue if you are deploying your game digitally or if you are submitting it to a mobile app store that has a file size limit</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The lag issue comes into play when you overstress processing capability or run into bandwidth limitations based on the user's network limitations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The final issue is of potential hardware constraints. Mobile devices have impressive processing capabilities, but they still underperform when compared to consoles and desktop computers. For example, the issues of alpha transparency and the number of draw calls are important considerations when developing for mobile devices</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec31"></a>Imposing limits</h4></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id311" class="indexterm"></a> following are a few techniques you can use to help reduce the rendering processing overhead and time:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Avoid or limit the use of in-game fog</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Limit the use of dense particle effects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Limit shadows</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Limit reflections</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Use light maps instead of dynamic lighting</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec32"></a>Baking images</h4></div></div></div><p>Another<a id="id312" class="indexterm"></a> important concept to grasp is the baking of images. We can use baked images to simulate shadows and depth. Using images such as the one for the Colt character in the following screenshot, we can bake special features into the core artwork. This mitigates the need for shadows and lighting effects:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_07_21.jpg" /></div><p>Software such<a id="id313" class="indexterm"></a> as Photoshop can be used to bake lighting into our 3D models and objects. One technique is to create the lighting effects on a separate layer and then export the final artwork with all layers.</p></div></div></div>
