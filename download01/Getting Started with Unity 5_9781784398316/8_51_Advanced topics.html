And this section could be additional advanced topics. In this section, we'll take a quick look at particle systems, inventory control systems, and dialog systems.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec63"></a>Particle systems</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity includes an <a id="id341" class="indexterm"></a>impressive capability to render particles in games. We use particles to represent dynamic visuals such as fog, smoke, fire, sparks, pixie dust, and more. You can think of particles as multiple tiny images in motion. Think of a fireworks display. They consist of hundreds of tiny lights all in motion. Using Unity's particle system, we can replicate this type of imagery.</p><p>To implement a particle system in Unity, navigate and select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Particle System</strong></span> from the top menu. This will result in a <span class="strong"><strong>Particle System</strong></span> object being placed in your <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. Reviewing the <span class="strong"><strong>Particle System</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view shows a host of settings that can be used to change how the particle system functions and is rendered.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_08_02.jpg" /></div><p>If you plan to <a id="id342" class="indexterm"></a>implement a particle system in your game, I recommend consulting the Unity documentation for instructional information.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec64"></a>Inventory control systems</h3></div></div></div><p>Inventory control <a id="id343" class="indexterm"></a>systems are key parts of a lot of games. Unity does not provide this as a component, so you'll have to either use a third-party plugin or develop one on your own. There are six simple steps to creating an inventory control system:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a table of all possible inventory items your game will feature. Be sure to record attributes as well.</p></li><li><p>Categorize your inventory items.</p></li><li><p>Mock up the GUI for how your user will interact with the inventory control system.</p></li><li><p>Create the artwork in a standardized way so that all items fit within your GUI.</p></li><li><p>Script the inventory control system.</p></li><li><p>Thoroughly <a id="id344" class="indexterm"></a>test your system.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec65"></a>Dialog systems</h3></div></div></div><p>Dialog systems <a id="id345" class="indexterm"></a>can be fun game components when humanoid NPCs are involved. You do not have to have actual spoken text, but that can be a huge bonus. What is standard is on-screen text with branched answers. It is likely that you've used this feature in many games and are familiar with them. The following are a few tips to keep in mind when developing your own dialog system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Map out the entire dialog on paper using flowcharts before scripting. This will help ensure your dialog trees have no dead ends.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Always give the player an option to end the dialog.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Ideally, from a user interface perspective, users will not have to scroll to see all the response choices.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
