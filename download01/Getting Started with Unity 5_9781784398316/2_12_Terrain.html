We'll create our terrain with a water feature running down the middle of the land and a natural bridge that allows the player to travel between sides. On the left side of our terrain, we'll put Colt's farmhouse and areas for both chickens and pigs. The old farmer will have a farmhouse on the right side of the terrain, surrounded by a corn maze.</p><p>To make the land look a bit more interesting, we'll include some hills and trees. The following diagram shows a mockup up of what we'll create in the remainder of this chapter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>We'll create a Unity project and continually update it throughout the remainder of the book. To create the project, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Launch the Unity application on your computer.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> button on initial Unity dialog window.</p></li><li><p>Enter <code class="literal">LittleFarmerColt</code> for the project name.</p></li><li><p>Select a folder <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>location for your project. I recommend selecting an area that is automatically backed up by your system.</p></li><li><p>Ensure <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span> is selected.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span> button.</p></li></ol></div><p>After you follow these steps, Unity will open your new project. In the next section, we'll start creating the terrain.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"></a>Creating the terrain</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity treats terrain as a <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>game object. You'll see reference to this in Unity as <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. Game objects are a fundamental feature in Unity. Everything is a game object, including characters, trees, lights, cameras, and more. These objects act as containers for components.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>In Unity, projects contain game objects of all kinds. You'll be able to see all game objects in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view. You'll use some of these game objects in your scene. So, things (game objects) in a scene are visible in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view. When we drag game objects from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view into the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, we are creating an instance or copy of that game object.</p></div><p>You'll see later in the book how we can add components to game objects. For now, we want to create our game's terrain. We'll do this by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In Unity, projects contain game objects of all kinds. You'll be able to see all game objects in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view. You'll use some of these game objects in your scene. So, things (game objects) in a scene are visible in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view. When we drag game objects from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view into the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, we are creating an instance or copy of that game object.</p></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> drop-down menu, then select <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span>. This will create a terrain object. You'll see the object listed in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> views:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_03.jpg" /></div></li><li>
Next, we'll reduce the size of the terrain to something more manageable. We'll accomplish this by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, and then selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Settings</strong></span> button (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_04.jpg" /></span>) in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view. Scroll down and change both <a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a>the <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Length</strong></span> to <code class="literal">250</code>. This will result in the terrain being resized to 250x250.
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>When we initially create a terrain in Unity, the origin of that terrain is in a corner. You can change the scene origin to (0,0,0) so that it is in the middle of the terrain. This can make it easier to manage the terrain.</p></div></li><li>
Still in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Paint Height Tool</strong></span> button (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_05.jpg" /></span>) and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Flatten</strong></span> button. Note that when you "flatten" the terrain, the object may leave the frame in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. You can double-click on the object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view to bring the object back in frame.
</li></ol></div><p>The terrain is created and we are now ready to add some features to our terrain.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>Adding mountains</h3></div></div></div><p>We'll create mountains and <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>hills on our terrain to give it some character. Since our game is predominately a farm, we'll only put mountains around the edges <a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a>of the terrain. This will help us keep things under control and prevent Colt, our game character, from falling off the edge of the earth.</p><p>Unity makes erecting mountains as simple as dragging your mouse's cursor. Here are the steps we'll use to create our mountains:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>
In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Raise/Lower Terrain</strong></span> tool (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_06.jpg" /></span>).
</li><li><p>You'll see a variety of brush types available to you in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view below the tool icons. Select one of the brush types with a single click. You can also change the brush size with the slider in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view or by entering in a numeric value.</p></li><li><p>Move your mouse over to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. When you push the left mouse button and drag the cursor over the terrain, you'll notice that you start painting mountains on the terrain.</p></li><li><p>Paint a row of mountains along all four edges of the terrain.</p></li></ol></div><p>Our mountains and terrain do not look like much yet, so we'll get to that shortly.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Adding a river</h3></div></div></div><p>Our next task is to <a id="id59" class="indexterm"></a>create a river. You'll remember from our terrain mockup that we <a id="id60" class="indexterm"></a>want the river to flow from one end of the terrain, down the middle to the opposite end. We'll tackle this task in two phases. The first phase is digging a trench, or lowering the terrain where we want the river. The second phase is adding the water. We'll take care of the first phase now. To do so, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>
In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Raise/Lower Terrain</strong></span> tool (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_06.jpg" /></span>).
</li><li><p>Select a large brush size.</p></li><li><p>Move your mouse cursor into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.</p></li><li><p>Hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key down and keep the left mouse button pressed. Now, as you drag your mouse over the terrain, you'll be lowering the terrain.</p></li><li><p>Lower the terrain in the center, from one end of the terrain to the other. This will create an area for water that will effectively split the terrain in half visually.</p></li><li><p>If you did not leave <a id="id61" class="indexterm"></a>an area for Colt to walk across the water, raise an area in the center now.</p></li></ol></div><p>We will add water, the second phase of creating our river, later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Textures</h3></div></div></div><p>Textures in Unity are image <a id="id62" class="indexterm"></a>files that can be used for adding a textured surface to an <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>object. At the onset, we do not have any textures loaded into Unity. We'll quickly add some terrain textures by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> drop-down menu, then select <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>This will result in an <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> dialog window popping up.</p></li><li><p>All the objects in the package will already be selected, so you simply need to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> <a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a>button to add this package to your Unity project. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button.</p></li></ol></div><p>This is a large package, so it might take a minute or more to import. We'll talk more about packages later in the book. For now, know that this is a quick way to add a lot of objects to your project.</p><p>Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> package came with several textures. If you expand the selections in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view, you'll notice that there is now a folder named <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>SampleAssets</strong></span>. The Environment package of assets is located in that folder. Within the <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span> folder, you'll see a <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> folder, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_08.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> folder contains, among other things, textures that we'll use to enhance our terrain.
