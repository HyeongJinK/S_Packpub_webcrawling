So far, we've completed the game design, game environment, player character, non-player characters, and animations. That is a lot of work for just four chapters. There are a few things we need to accomplish in order to complete our game. First on this list is scripting the game.</p><p>In this chapter, we will write scripts for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Managing the amount of water and corn that Colt collects</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Monitoring how much water and corn each farm animal is given</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Managing when a piglet becomes a pig and when a baby chick becomes an adult chicken</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Managing when pigs and chickens reach blue ribbon status</p></li></ul></div><p>Before we dive right into scripting, I'll provide a C# programming primer for those that need it. We'll also review how scripting is accomplished in Unity, where to find scripts, and how to use MonoDevelop.</p><p>After reading this chapter, you will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understand the fundamentals of C#</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be able to use MonoDevelop to create and edit scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be able to locate scripts in a Unity project</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understand how to read Unity scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be able to create custom scripts</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"></a>Note</h3><p>Throughout this chapter, you will see the terms scripting and programming used interchangeably. In the context of this chapter, they are the same thing.</p></div></div>
