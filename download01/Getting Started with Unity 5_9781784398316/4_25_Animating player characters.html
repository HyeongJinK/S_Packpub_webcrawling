<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec28"></a>Animating player characters</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Our game, like most <a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a>games, will consist of animated characters. Even if a non-player character only has a looped idle animation, it is important that they be animated. Otherwise, the characters will be more of a statue than a character.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec31"></a>Little farmer Colt</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's continue working <a id="id183" class="indexterm"></a>on our Colt character and ensure all of his animations work. By browsing the assets in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view, you can see there are five animations associated with Colt. The animations are idle, run, take, talk, and walk. These animations have already been created, so we are able to use them in our game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_04_18.jpg" /></div><p>Some of the animations will simply just seem to work because of the character controller we used. For example, if you <a id="id184" class="indexterm"></a>test the game in play mode, you'll see that our walk animation is responsive to the navigation keys on our keyboard as well as the WASD keys. Also, although we did not create a jump animation, Colt already knows how to jump. You can test this by pressing the space bar while in game mode.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_04_19.jpg" /></div><p>This is not magic; rather, it is a benefit of using the Unity game engine's third person character controller. Some <a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a>animations will be part of the character by default, others we will create in external tools, and some we will create within Unity.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec32"></a>Old farmer character</h3></div></div></div><p>We can add the old farmer <a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a>character to our game by simply dragging the object from <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view into <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. We are not ready to do that just yet, but we do want to review his animations. By navigating through the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view assets, you will notice that the old farmer has idle, talk, and walk animations. Although we will not use the walk animation for our game, it is included so you can expand the game after you finish working through the instructions provided in this book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec33"></a>Farm animals</h3></div></div></div><p>Browsing the remaining <a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a>assets reveals that the chick, chicken, pig adult, and piglet each have an idle and eat animation. There is nothing more for these animals to do than stand around and eat. As you'll see later in this book, we will add scripts to the animals so that we know how much they eat and grow.</p></div></div>
