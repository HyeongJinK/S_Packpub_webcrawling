We're almost ready to start creating our game. Before we do, we have two tasks to attend to: designing our game and creating the game's environment. We'll handle both of these tasks in this chapter.</p><p>This chapter will set the stage for developing our game using Unity. We'll start by examining our game's design, which will serve as the blueprint we'll follow throughout the rest of this book. Next, we'll create our game's environment, which will include terrain, water, and the sky. Our terrain will consist of trees, mountains, and a river.</p><p>Through this chapter, you will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understand the purpose of a game design</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be able to create terrain in Unity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be familiar with using textures</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be comfortable with creating mountains</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be comfortable planting trees</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be familiar with creating bodies of water</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Be able to create a sky in Unity</p></li></ul></div></div>
