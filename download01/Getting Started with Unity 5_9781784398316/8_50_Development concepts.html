The concepts of cross-platform considerations, plugins, and attribution are covered in this section.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec60"></a>Cross-platform considerations</h3></div></div></div><p>You can create <a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a>multiplayer games and have users on Android and iOS devices playing with or against one another. To accomplish this, you can use something such as Google Play's games services.</p><p>Another consideration is the various screen sizes of mobile devices. Apple has a finite number of mobile devices using iOS, but Android runs on a lot more different screen sizes and resolutions. You do not have to create one version for every screen size. Instead, you'll need to consider relative layouts and flexible dimensions.</p><p>As always, test your game on as many different devices as you can and be sure to vary operating system versions, screen sizes, and screen resolutions. In absence of actual hardware for testing, use software emulators.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec61"></a>Plugins</h3></div></div></div><p>We scripted our game by <a id="id338" class="indexterm"></a>writing our own scripts in Unity using MonoDevelop. We can also leverage code written outside of Unity. If you've developed or have rights to use a plugin, you can simply place it anywhere inside your project. It makes sense to create an <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Plugins</strong></span> folder in your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view.</p><p>One thing about many third-party plugins is that they can take more time to integrate into your game than to simply code <a id="id339" class="indexterm"></a>the functionality yourself. So, it is worth considering both options.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec62"></a>Attribution</h3></div></div></div><p>One mistake many indie <a id="id340" class="indexterm"></a>developers make is to use assets they obtain from the Internet. There are several repositories available including the Unity Asset Store. It is important to ensure you have the requisite permission to use downloaded content in your game.</p><p>If you are working on a commercial project, you'll want to ensure your asset comes with royalty-free commercial use clause. If you are not certain, you should contact the source where you obtained the asset.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"></a>Tip</h3><p>Just because you pay for an asset, it does not mean you have permission to use it for commercial purposes. Always check with the publisher of the asset to be sure you have explicit permission to use the asset for commercial use.</p></div></div></div>
