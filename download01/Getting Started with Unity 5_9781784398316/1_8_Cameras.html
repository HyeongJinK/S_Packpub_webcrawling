Every scene must have at least one camera. In fact, when a new scene is created, Unity creates a camera named <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>. As you'll see later in this book, a scene can have multiple cameras. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, cameras are indicated with a white camera silhouette, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_29.jpg" /></div><p>Cameras are game objects and can be edited using transform tools as well as in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view. We can classify Unity cameras based on their projection. A perspective projection camera renders a scene based on the camera angle, as it exists in the scene.</p><p>The other project is orthographic. An orthographic perspective camera renders a scene uniformly without any perspective. This type of camera is commonly used for top-down games and is the default camera used in 2D and Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>User Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span>) system.</p><p>When a camera is selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, its frustum is visible in <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. A frustum is a geographic shape that looks like a pyramid that has had its top cut off. The top plane is parallel to its base, in other words, the near and far plane.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_30.jpg" /></div><p>We'll use cameras in our <a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a>game later in the book.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>There are additional user interface components to Unity that we did not cover. As we need them in the development of our game, they'll be introduced prior to use.</p></div></div>
