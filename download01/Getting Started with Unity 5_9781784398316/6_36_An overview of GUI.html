<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec37"></a>An overview of GUI</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>A GUI is a <a id="id245" class="indexterm"></a>collection of visual components such as text, buttons, and images that facilitates a user's interaction with software. GUIs are also used to provide feedback to players. In the case of our game, the GUI allows players to interact with our game. Without a GUI, the user would have no visual indication of how to use the game. Imagine software without any on-screen indicators of how to use the software. The following image shows how early user interfaces were anything but intuitive:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_06_01.jpg" /></div><p>We use GUIs all the time and <a id="id246" class="indexterm"></a>might not pay too close attention to them, unless they are poorly designed. If you've ever tried to figure out how to use an app on your Smartphone or could not figure out how to perform a specific action with desktop software, you've most likely encountered a poorly designed GUI.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec43"></a>Functions of a GUI</h3></div></div></div><p>Our goal is to create a <a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a>GUI for our game that both informs the user and allows interaction between the game and the user. To that end, GUIs have two primary purposes: feedback and control. Feedback is generated by the game to the user and control is given to the user and managed by user input. Let's look at each of these more closely.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec21"></a>Feedback</h4></div></div></div><p>Feedback can come in<a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a> many forms. The most common forms of game feedback are visual and audio. Visual feedback can be something as simple as a text on a game screen. An example would be a game player's current score being ever-present on the game screen. Games that include dialog systems where the player interacts with <span class="strong"><strong>non-player characters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>)<a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a> usually have text feedback on the screen that informs the user what the NPC's responses are. Visual feedback can also be non-textual, such as smoke, fire, explosions, or other graphic effects.</p><p>Audio feedback can be as simple as a click sound when the user clicks or taps on a button or as complex as a radar ping when an enemy submarine is detected on long-distance sonar scans. You can probably think of all the audio feedback your favorite game provides. When you run your cart over a coin, an audio sound effect is played, so there is no question that you earned the coin. If you take a moment to consider all of the audio feedback you are exposed to in games, you'll begin to appreciate the significance of it.</p><p>Less typical feedback includes device vibration, which is sometimes used with smartphone applications and console games. Some attractions have taken feedback to another level through seat movement and vibration, dispensing liquid and vapor, and introducing chemicals that provide olfactory input.</p><p>We'll include the following feedback GUI elements<a id="id250" class="indexterm"></a> for our<a id="id251" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span> game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of units of corn Colt currently has</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of units of corn Colt has gathered in total</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of units of water Colt currently has</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of units of water Colt has gathered in total</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of piglets, pigs, and blue ribbon pigs currently on the farm</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of chicks, chickens, and blue ribbon chickens currently on the farm</p></li></ul></div><p>The following mockup <a id="id252" class="indexterm"></a>indicates how we will layout the aforementioned GUI <a id="id253" class="indexterm"></a>elements. You'll note in the mockup that only the top and bottom portions of the screen are represented:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_06_02.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec22"></a>Control</h4></div></div></div><p>Giving players control of the<a id="id254" class="indexterm"></a> game is the second function of GUIs. There is a wide gambit of types of control. The most simple is using buttons or menus in a game. A game might have a graphical icon of a backpack that, when clicked on, gives the user access to the inventory management system of a game.</p><p>Control seems like an <a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a>easy concept, and it is. Interestingly, most popular console games lack good GUI interfaces, especially when it comes to control. If you play console games, think about how many times you have to refer to the printed or in-game manual. Do you intuitively know all of the controller key mappings? How do you jump, switch weapons, crotch, throw a grenade, or go into stealth mode? In the defense of the game studios that publish these games, there is a lot of control and it can be difficult to make them intuitive.</p><p>By extension, control is often physical, in addition to graphical. Physical components of control include keyboards, mouse, trackballs, console controllers, microphones, and other devices.</p><p>We'll include the following control GUI elements for our <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span> game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keyboard arrow keys control Colt</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keyboard space bar jumps Colt</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Keyboard <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> evokes the <code class="literal">take</code> animation and function</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Full-screen game navigation buttons</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec23"></a>Feedback and Control</h4></div></div></div><p>Feedback and control GUI <a id="id256" class="indexterm"></a>elements are often paired. When you click or tap a button, it usually has both visual and audio effects, as well as executing the user's action. When you click on (control) a treasure chest, it opens (visual feedback) and you hear the creak of the old wooden hinges (audio feedback). This example <a id="id257" class="indexterm"></a>shows the power of using adding feedback to control actions.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec44"></a>Game Layers</h3></div></div></div><p>At a primitive level, there are three <a id="id258" class="indexterm"></a>layers to every game. The core or base level is the Game Layer. This is <a id="id259" class="indexterm"></a>your game and, in context of this book, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span> game. The top layer is the User Layer; this is the actual person playing your game. So, it is the layer in betweenâ€”the GUI Layer that serves as an intermediary between a game and its player. The following figure shows the three layers:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_06_03.jpg" /></div><p>It becomes clear that designing and developing intuitive and well-functioning GUIs is important to a game's functionality, the user's experience, and a game's success.</p></div></div>
