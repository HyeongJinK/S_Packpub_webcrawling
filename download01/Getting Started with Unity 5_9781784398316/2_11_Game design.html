<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"></a>Game design</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>A game's design is like a <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>blueprint for a house. You would not consider building a house without a blueprint and it is an equally bad idea to develop a game without designing it first. Our game design will document the look of our game, what the player's objectives are, what the gameplay will be, supported user actions, the required artificial intelligence, and game flow.</p><p>Designing a game is significantly more complex than simply considering these six elements. We do not have time to go through the entire game design process, so you'll see the primary areas of the game designed in this chapter.</p><p>Our game will be called <span class="strong"><strong>Little Farmer Colt</strong></span>. It will feature a young farmer named Colt, who has to manage a farm. Let's look at the elements of game look, player objectives, gameplay, user <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>actions, artificial intelligence, and end state.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"></a>Game look</h3></div></div></div><p>All games have a look to them. For a <a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a>game that takes place in space, the game look might be a futuristic/mechanical. If it is a children's math game, it might have a cartoon style look. The importance of addressing a game's look is to ensure it is consistent throughout the game.</p><p>Our game will take place on a small farm, so the game look will be rural farming. It will consist of farm animals, appropriate buildings, crops, water, grass, and dirt. One trick in maintaining game look consistency is to have the same graphic artist create all the artwork. On large projects, this is not always feasible, but it will work for our small game project. All the art used in our game was created by a single graphic artist.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"></a>Player objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>Users that play <a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a>our game will need to know what their objectives are. These objectives will give them a purpose in the game. Objectives also add fun to games. Our game will include three objectives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Objective 1</strong></span>: Learn how to farm the land. The player will accomplish this objective by talking to the old farmer.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Objective 2</strong></span>: Raise chickens. This will be accomplished by gathering corn and water and feeding the chickens.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Objective 3</strong></span>: Raise pigs. The player will meet this objective in the same manner as with the chickens: by providing food and water.</p></li></ul></div><p>To support these objectives, we'll provide cornfields and a stream. The player will harvest corn from the fields and collect water from the stream. Both corn and water will be used to feed the farm animals.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"></a>Gameplay</h3></div></div></div><p>Gameplay is a reference to <a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>how players interact with a game. For our Little Farmer <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>Colt game, players will use both the keyboard and the mouse. The mouse will be used to rotate Colt; the main game character and the keyboard arrow keys will be used to navigate Colt in our game world.</p><p>The following image is a graphic view of our controls. They are standard and Unity makes it easy to use these <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>controls. We'll take care of this later in the <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>book:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_02_01.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"></a>User actions</h3></div></div></div><p>Another element of <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>game design is defining what actions players will be able to perform. These actions might include sailing a ship, launching a rocket, swimming, climbing, and more. For our game, our player will be able to perform the following actions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Walk throughout the game world</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pick up corn</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Pick up water</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Feed chickens</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Feed pigs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Talk to the old farmer</p></li></ul></div><p>This list of actions can serve as a checklist for things we need to implement in our game. We'll do just that later in the book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>) is achieved when we program game objects based on real objects that exhibit <a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a>intelligence. The player will control Colt, the game character, so that just leaves a couple of game objects that we can implement <a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a>AI for. These objects are the old farmer, chickens, and pigs.</p><p>We'll use the old farmer to demonstrate a dialog system. So, he will not have any AI; rather, he will have a predefined set of responses based on Colt's dialog menu selections.</p><p>Both the chickens and pigs will have similar AI implemented. They will start out as baby chicks and piglets. Given enough water and corn, they'll grow into adulthood. When fully grown, they will automatically produce baby chicks and piglets. We'll also include some criteria for them to die if they are not provided with enough water and food.</p><p>So, our AI list for this game is as illustrated in the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col align="left" /><col align="left" /><col align="left" /></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " align="left" valign="bottom">

There <a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a>are two types of end states: victory and defeat. The victory condition is the end goal. This lets players know what they are working towards. We need to determine how players will beat the game. For Little Farmer Colt, we'll send the victory condition to the game state containing five full-grown chickens and five full-grown pigs. Full grown will be designated as blue ribbon animals. In a larger game, this end state might signify the ending of the first level. This gives you the opportunity to further develop the game when you are finished reading this book.</p><p>The other end state is defeat. We have already identified that the animals can die. So, we'll set the defeat condition to occur if there is not at least one of each type of animal. It will not matter whether the animals are chicks and piglets or chickens and pigs.</p><p>Okay, our game is fully <a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a>designed. Now we can start creating our game environment. We'll start with terrain in the next section.</p></div></div>
