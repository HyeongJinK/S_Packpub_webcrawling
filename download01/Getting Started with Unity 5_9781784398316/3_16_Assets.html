In Unity, assets are useable game objects. There are <a id="id101" class="indexterm"></a>three basic types of assets: Unity, user-created, and third party. As the <a id="id102" class="indexterm"></a>names <a id="id103" class="indexterm"></a>suggest, they are based on how the asset is <a id="id104" class="indexterm"></a>created. Unity comes<a id="id105" class="indexterm"></a> with free <a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a>assets and offers a library of<a id="id107" class="indexterm"></a> premium (not free) assets. User-created assets are those that you create yourself. We will create our own assets later in this chapter. The final asset type is third party, which indicates that someone other than you or Unity created it.</p><p>When we select the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> drop-down menu, we see several functions available to us. The functions<a id="id108" class="indexterm"></a> we'll cover in this chapter are <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Assetâ€¦</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>Navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> reveals several types of assets we can create directly from within Unity. You'll notice<a id="id109" class="indexterm"></a> that assets can be scripts, shaders, prefabs, materials, animations, and more. Assets are essentially any item we use in our game. We'll use some of these in later chapters as we complete our game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_02.jpg" /></div><p>We can also create<a id="id110" class="indexterm"></a> basic 3D assets, such as a cube and a sphere. To create a physical 3D object, you would navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot, and select what object to create. Using these objects may not be what you need for your game, and we certainly do not need them for <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Farmer Colt</em></span>. These assets are great for testing components and scripts in Unity projects. We can delete them that than we can create them, so they make great and expendable test assets. These objects are great for prototyping. We can use them in our games to experiment before we spend any time on final graphics.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_03.jpg" /></div></div>
