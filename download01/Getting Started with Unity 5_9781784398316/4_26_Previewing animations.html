<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec29"></a>Previewing animations</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>When our game is <a id="id188" class="indexterm"></a>being played, the characters will all have idle animations that play when the character is idle. The eat animations will be played when there is food to eat or water to drink. Colt's walk animation will be played in response to keyboard or mouse input. We'll add scripts that handle Colt's "take" animation, as well as the talk animations for the two farmers.</p><p>Unity provides us with the ability to preview animations without having to complete the game first and add our scripts. Our game has 16 animations, so being able to preview them without programming them into our game is a great time saver.</p><p>Let's preview Colt's animations. The steps are the same for all animations. In the following steps, we'll focus on the take animation:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view, navigate and select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Farmer Boy</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>FarmerBoy_Take</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span> tab, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_04_20.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, click and drag the expand section bar upward so that the window with Colt in is large enough to view, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_04_21.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>With the preview window large enough to view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>play</strong></span> button in the top-left corner of the preview window. You will now see the animation play.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_04_22.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now that you know how to <a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a>preview animations in the game project, you should check the remaining 15 animations so you know how they work. In the next section, we will create our own animation by using Unity's built-in animation clip creation functionality.</p></div>
