<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec47"></a>Improving our game</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We can be proud of our game, but there is not much for a game player to get excited about once they've played the game for a while. Here are some suggestions to make our game more robust and more enjoyable for users to play.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec54"></a>Audio</h3></div></div></div><p>Together, we added sound <a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a>effects for pigs crying and a "points" sound when Colt takes corn or water. The following are some opportunities for additional audio in the game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Background music</strong></span>: A <a id="id318" class="indexterm"></a>subtle background clip played on a loop will go a long way to making the game more immersive. We created something that is appropriate for the game environment. Be sure to review the priorities you set for each audio clip.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Animal sound effects</strong></span>: Ideally, each animal could have three sounds, idle, eating, and drinking. The "pigs crying" sound effect we already added to our game would work for the pig and piglet idle clips. Adding the additional sound effects will help make the game seem more real and add an element of fun.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Old farmer</strong></span>: Currently, the old farmer has several animations. One of these animations is talking. Perhaps an audio clip could be added that sounds muffled. This technique shows that the NPC is talking, but the actual words are indiscernible.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span>: Our game has a large body of water that we've set up as a hazard and a resource. So, Colt can fall into the water and he can retrieve water. This gives us the opportunity to add two water-related sound effects; a water splash when Colt falls in the water and another sound when Colt is taking water.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Colt</strong></span>: Adding a couple of sound effects to the game's main character will help engender players to the character. When Colt jumps, a "woo-hoo" sound could be played or a soft thud could be heard when he lands back on the ground. Maybe after the player has been running for more than <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> seconds, his breathing could get heavy.</p></li></ul></div><p>You can use your imagination to help enliven the game by adding audio clips. Not everything needs a sound effect, so you'll want to keep that in mind as you start experimenting.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec55"></a>Visual effects</h3></div></div></div><p>Adding visual effects to <a id="id319" class="indexterm"></a>our game will help make it shine. Other than lighting and shadows, our game does not have any visual effects. Here are some ideas you can consider when improving the visual effects for the game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Water</strong></span>: When Colt <a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a>falls into the water, it would be great if a splash were seen. Also, when Colt is submerged, air bubbles would be a nice visual addition.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Mirror</strong></span>: We've made the game with a first person perspective. This means that the players never actually see the character they are playing, Colt. We went through a lot of trouble to create the 3D model and animations, so players deserve to see it. Instead of making the game a third-person perspective game, we <a id="id321" class="indexterm"></a>can add a mirror to the side of one of the barns. You could accomplish this by adding a reflection probe.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following are the <a id="id322" class="indexterm"></a>steps to create a mirror in Unity:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a cube by <a id="id323" class="indexterm"></a>navigating and selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> menu selection.</p></li><li><p>Using the transform tools, reshape the cube so that it is flat and the size of mirror that is sufficient to fit on the side of Colt's barn.</p></li><li><p>Move the cube to the side of Colt's barn.</p></li><li><p>With the cube selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> button in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, then navigate and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Reflection Probe</strong></span> option.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, select <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Realtime</strong></span> to have the reflection occur during the game dynamically.</p></li><li><p>Still in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, navigate and select <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Refresh Mode</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Every frame</strong></span>. This will ensure your mirror is continually updated during the game.</p></li><li><p>Rename the cube as <code class="literal">MirrorCube</code>.</p></li><li><p>Drag the <span class="strong"><strong>MirrorCube</strong></span> section from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view to make it a prefab.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view, make the following changes to the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> section:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Set <span class="strong"><strong>Reflection Probes</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Probes</strong></span></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Drag the <span class="strong"><strong>MirrorCube</strong></span> prefab from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view to the <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor Override</strong></span> input box:</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_08_01.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>You might need to experiment with the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Reflection Probe</strong></span> settings to get the mirror exactly <a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a>how you want it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec56"></a>Functionality</h3></div></div></div><p>You can add almost any <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>functionality you want to this game. It just takes assets and scripting. The following are some things that would be appropriate for the game based on what we've done so far with it:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Body of water</strong></span>: Currently, not much happens when Colt falls into the water. We've already discussed audio and visual enhancements regarding the water. For functionality, it would be nice if the player could walk on the bottom of the lake and be able to climb back out. Currently, neither of those actions is possible. To make things even more interesting, the player could have a limited amount of oxygen with an on-screen indicator. This would compel the user to work feverishly to get out of the water. If the player does not exit the water fast enough, they (the game character) could die.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Corn</strong></span>: The corn and cornstalks in our game are somewhat arbitrary. You could add a script to the game so that each ear of corn can only be taken once. Each time the player executes the "take" action, the ear of corn the player is colliding with could disappear (destroy game object).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Old farmer option one</strong></span>: The old farmer character is more than just a pretty face. He is capable of so much more than just standing there and being idle. A good option for this character would be to implement a dialog system so the player character can interact with him. To make this viable, the game would need to force the player to interact with the old farmer before going too far in the game. Perhaps, Colt could start the game with no animals. Once he has a conversation with the old farmer, he could receive piglets and baby chicks.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Old farmer option two</strong></span>: If you are feeling extra adventurous, you can edit the game so that a single player controls both the old farmer and Colt. The player would need to have a way to switch between the two characters. Having two sets of farm animals to tend to will make the game more challenging.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Old farmer option three</strong></span>: The next suggestion is not for the faint-hearted, but is worth considering. You can edit the game so two players can play it at the same time via <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>network or web server. One player could control Colt, and other the old farmer. The game could have two modes: cooperative and versus.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec57"></a>Levels</h3></div></div></div><p>Our game has a single <a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a>level that never ends. That is okay, but it would be much more interesting if the game had multiple levels. Each level would need a specific goal <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>and set of requirements before the player can move on. What will the additional levels consist of? That is for you to decide. The following are some rough suggestions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Each new level could add one additional farm animal such as cows, horses, and goats</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Each new level could add another resource to gather such as grain, milk, oats, and more</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The number of each type of animal could increase for subsequent levels, making it more difficult to manage</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The size of the farmland could increase with each level</p></li></ul></div><p>You are only limited by your imagination.</p></div></div>
