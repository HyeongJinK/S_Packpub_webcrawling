You visited the Unity Asset Store and reviewed what information is available on assets located in the Store. You gained experience downloading and importing assets into your game. You also learned a little about how to create 3D objects using Blender, a free and open-source 3D modeling tool.</p><p>In the next chapter, you'll animate the game's characters. The animations will include idle animations for all characters, both human and animal, talk animations for the farmers. Colt, our player-controlled character, will also receive walk and take animations. The take animation will be for the harvesting of corn and water. And, just for fun, we'll give Colt the ability to jump.</p></div>
