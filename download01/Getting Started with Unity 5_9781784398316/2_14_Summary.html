The game design will serve as a reference point for our remaining work on the game throughout this book. The game design also informed the characteristics of our terrain. We created a terrain, added a texture to the terrain, added mountains, trees, and a river. We even created a natural bridge. We concluded our chapter by adding a Skybox.</p><p>Our game's foundation is now created and you have the experience to create your own game environments.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll take a close look at how to import and use assets in Unity. We'll do more than experiment; we'll actually import our game's main character Colt, the old farmer, and the animals.</p></div>
