In this section, we'll do just that.</p><p>There are several tools that can be used to create 3D objects for use in Unity. One of the most commonly used is Blender. Blender is a free and open source 3D modeling program that has an impressive array of capabilities. There are several books and online tutorials that can teach you how to use Blender to create assets. Teaching you how to create them from scratch is beyond the scope of this book.</p><p>What we do have time to discuss is how to take a Blender object and export it into a Unity-supported format. Let's do that together by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>If you do <a id="id144" class="indexterm"></a>not already have a copy of Blender on your computer, download a copy from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Download the <code class="literal">corn_stalk.blend</code> file from this book's web page.</p></li><li><p>Launch Blender.</p></li><li><p>In Blender, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> to open a file dialog window.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to the <code class="literal">corn_stalk.blend</code> file you previously downloaded. Select the file.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Open Blender File</strong></span> button, which is located in the top-right corner of the window. You'll now be able to see the object in Blender.</p></li></ol></div><p>Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_03_18.jpg" /></div><p>The <a id="id145" class="indexterm"></a>preceding screenshot shows how the object looks after<a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a> it has been created in Blender. Now, we simply need to export it so we can use it in Unity. To do so, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Navigate and select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>FBX (.fbx)</strong></span> to export the object to an <code class="literal">.fbx</code> file.</p></li><li><p>Select a file location for the file.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Export FBX</strong></span> button located in the top-right corner of the window.</p></li><li><p>Launch Unity and open your project.</p></li><li><p>Navigate and select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> from the drop-down menu. This brings up the <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> dialog window.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to where you saved the <code class="literal">.fbx</code> file. Select the file and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>Close Blender.</p></li><li><p>Save your Unity project.</p></li></ol></div><p>You'll now see the corn stalk asset listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view.</p></div>
