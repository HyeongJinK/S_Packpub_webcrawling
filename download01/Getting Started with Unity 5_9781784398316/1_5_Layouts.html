<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"></a>Layouts</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>One of the wonderful <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>things about working with Unity is that you can customize the way the user interface is laid out. You can use one of the predefined layouts of <span class="strong"><strong>2 by 3</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>4 Split</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Tall</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Wide</strong></span>, or you can create your own. Layouts refer to how the various views in Unity are arranged on the screen. You'll learn about views in the next section.</p><p>To change a layout, we simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> button that is located in the far top-right corner of the Unity interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_08.jpg" /></div><p>Let's look at each layout to see the differences. The first layout is the 2 by 3 layout. This layout provides a nice arrangement with the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> views on the left, the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> views in the middle and a full <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_09.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>4 Split</strong></span> layout provides four different views of the same scene, as shown in the following screenshot. This is a <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>good way to review how lighting and shading is implemented in your game. We'll talk about lighting and shading later in the book.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_10.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Tall</strong></span> layout provides a <a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a>tall, but not wide view of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view with other views located on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_11.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Wide</strong></span> layout provides a wide view of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, with other views located on the bottom and on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_12.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span> layout is a <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>variation of the <span class="strong"><strong>Wide</strong></span> layout. The difference is that with the <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span> layout, the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view is on the left, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784398316/graphics/3852_01_13.jpg" /></div><p>You can switch between views anytime you want without it impacting your game. Most Unity developers do not work in just one view. Different views provide different benefits and are appropriate for different tasks. You can also modify any view by dragging any of the borders of a view. If you <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>want to save a view, make any changes to the current view, then select the <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> button and select <span class="strong"><strong>Save Layout</strong></span>. You will be prompted for a name.</p></div>
