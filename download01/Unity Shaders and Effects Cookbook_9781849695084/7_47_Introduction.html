It gives us the power to create very complex lighting solutions for the surfaces of those objects, but we can also use Shaders to actually modify the vertices of our objects. This becomes very advantageous as we can process these modifications to our object's vertices faster using a Shader.</p><p>The vertex function is executed once for each vertex that is sent to the <span class="strong"><strong>graphics processing unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPU</strong></span>)<a id="id444" class="indexterm"></a>. Its job is to take the vertex from its 3D local space and transform it in such a way that it renders in the right location on the 2D screen. With the vertex function, we have the ability to modify elements such as the vertex position, its color, and its UV coordinate. Once the vertex function is finished modifying the vertex, it moves to the <code class="literal">surf()</code> function<a id="id445" class="indexterm"></a> where per-pixel effects are applied.</p><p>Using the vertex shader, we can gain a powerful amount of control over our model to create effects such as waves on an ocean, or a waving flag, or shade our model with vertex colors. In this chapter we will be learning how to use the vertex function in a Surface Shader.</p></div>
