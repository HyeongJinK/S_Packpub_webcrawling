So it always makes sense to start the Shader writing process with the diffuse component of the Shader.</p><p>Previously in computer graphics, diffuse shading<a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a> was done with what was called the <a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>fixed function lighting model</strong></span>. It gave graphics programmers just a single lighting model that they could tweak, using a set of parameters and textures. In our current industry, we have access to much more control and flexibility with <a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>Cg, and especially in Unity<a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a> with its Surface Shaders.</p><p>The diffuse component of a Shader basically describes the way light reflects off a surface in all directions. That might sound very similar to the description of how a reflective mirror works, but it is actually different. A reflective surface actually reflects the image of the surrounding environment, while diffuse lighting takes all the light from light sources, such as the sun, and reflects its light back to the viewer's eye. We will be covering reflections in a later chapter, but for our purposes right now, this will help us differentiate between the two.</p><p>To achieve a basic diffuse lighting model, we will have to create a Shader that will include an emissive color, an ambient color, and the total light accumulated from all light sources. The following recipes show you how to build up a complete diffuse lighting model, and also show some various industry tricks that come in handy for creating more complicated diffuse models using only textures.</p><p>By the end of this chapter you will have learned how to build basic Shaders that perform basic operations. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to create just about any Surface Shader.</p></div>
