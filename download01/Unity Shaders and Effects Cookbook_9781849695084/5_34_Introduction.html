In this chapter, we are going to take advantage of our new-found knowledge to create our own complete Shaders for different effects.</p><p>We are going to look at some common types of Shaders that are needed for many games in the industry. This will arm us with the workflows to produce our own Shaders and learn more about trying to tackle new Shaders when a game production calls for a custom Material. We will also discuss some of the ways in which you can create more efficiency when working within a team and how the artists on that team can use your Shaders.</p></div>
