We won't be talking about any one platform specifically, but we are going to begin to break down the elements of the Shaders we can adjust to make them more optimized for mobile, and make them more efficient on any platform in general. These techniques range from understanding what Unity offers you in terms of built-in variables that reduce the overhead of the Shaders' memory to learning about ways in which we can make our own Shader code more efficient. This chapter will cover the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What is a cheap Shader?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Profiling our Shaders</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Modifying your Shaders for mobile</p></li></ul></div></div>
