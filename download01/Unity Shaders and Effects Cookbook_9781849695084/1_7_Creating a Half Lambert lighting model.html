It basically brightens up the diffuse lighting of the Material and wraps the diffuse light around an object's surface.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>"Half Lambert" lighting is a technique first developed in the original Half-Life (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life" target="_blank">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life</a>). It is designed to prevent the rear of an object losing its shape and looking too flat. Half Lambert is a completely nonphysical technique and gives a purely perceived visual enhancement. It is an example of a forgiving lighting model.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>

This basically means that if you have a value of 1 and you cut it in half, you will have 0.5. Then, if you add 0.5 back to it, you will have 1 again. If you did this same operation to a value of 0, you would end up with 0.5. So, we have taken a range of values from 0 to 1 and re-mapped it to be within a range of 0.5 to 1.0.</p><p>The following shows the diffuse value mapped to a function graph, showing the result of the Half Lambert calculation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084_01_09.jpg" /></div></div></div>
