It is the process of using the world around you and letting the Shader reflect that world's information to simulate the environment reflecting on the surface of the Shader. This is in part because we are able to use a new kind of texture called a Cubemap. This type of texture is made up of six textures and uses these six textures to surround the current surface in a cube-like fashion. So imagine a cube and each face of that cube has one of the six textures on the face of it. This allows us to capture our environment and bake it into textures.</p><p>We will see how to generate our own Cubemaps from our own environments, and we are going to look at different ways in which we can use these generated Cubemaps to create reflection effects in our Shaders. This is great for simulating metal, car paint, and even plastics. So in this chapter we are going to learn the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating Cubemaps in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Simple Cubemap reflection in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Masking reflections in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Normal maps and Reflections in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fresnel reflections in Unity3D</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a simple dynamic Cubemap system in Unity3D</p></li></ul></div></div>
