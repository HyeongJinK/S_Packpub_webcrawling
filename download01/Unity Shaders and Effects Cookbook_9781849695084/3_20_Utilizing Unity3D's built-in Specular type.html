It is called the BlinnPhong Specular lighting model. It is one of the more basic and efficient forms of Specular, which you can find used in a lot of games even today. Since it is already built into the Unity Surface Shader language, we thought it is best to start with that first and build on it. You can also find an example in the Unity reference manual, but we will go into a bit more depth with it and explain where the data is coming from and why it is working the way it is. This will help you to get a nice grounding in setting up Specular, so that we can build on that knowledge in the future recipes in this chapter.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec55"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's start by carrying out the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new Shader and give it a name.</p></li><li><p>Create a new Material, give it a name, and assign the new Shader to its shaper property.</p></li><li><p>Then create a sphere object and place it roughly at world center.</p></li><li><p>Finally, let's create a directional light to cast some light onto our object.</p></li></ol></div><p>When your assets have been set up in Unity, you should have a scene that resembles the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_01.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec56"></a>How to do it…</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Begin <a id="id155" class="indexterm"></a>by adding the following <a id="id156" class="indexterm"></a>properties to the Shader's <code class="literal">Properties</code> block:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We then need to make sure we add the variables to the <code class="literal">CGPROGRAM</code> block, so that we can use the data in our new properties inside our Shader's <code class="literal">CGPROGRAM</code> block. Notice that we don't need to declare the <code class="literal">_SpecColor</code> property as a variable. This is because Unity has already created this variable for us in the built-in Specular model. All we need to do is declare it in our Properties block and it will pass the data<a id="id157" class="indexterm"></a> along to the <code class="literal">surf()</code> function.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_04.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Our Shader now needs to be told which lighting model we want to use to light our model with. You have seen the Lambert lighting model and how to make your own <a id="id158" class="indexterm"></a>lighting model, but we haven't seen the <span class="strong"><strong>BlinnPhong lighting model</strong></span> yet. So, let's add <code class="literal">BlinnPhong</code> to our <code class="literal">#pragma</code> statement like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_05.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We then <a id="id159" class="indexterm"></a>need to modify our <code class="literal">surf()</code> function to look like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_06.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec57"></a>How it works…</h3></div></div></div><p>This basic Specular is a great starting point when you are prototyping your Shaders, as you can get a lot accomplished in terms of writing the core functionality of the Shader, while not having to worry about the basic lighting functions.</p><p>Unity has provided us with a lighting model that has already taken the task of creating your Specular lighting for you. If you look into the <code class="literal">UnityCG.cginc</code> file<a id="id160" class="indexterm"></a> found in your Unity's install directory under the <code class="literal">Data</code> folder, you will notice that you have Lambert and BlinnPhong lighting models available for you to use. The moment you compile your Shader with the <code class="literal">#pragma</code> surface surf BlinnPhong, you are telling the Shader to utilize the BlinnPhong lighting function in the <code class="literal">UnityCG.cginc</code> file, so that we don't have to write that code over and over again.</p><p>With your Shader<a id="id161" class="indexterm"></a> compiled and no errors present, you should see a result similar to the <a id="id162" class="indexterm"></a>following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695084/graphics/5084OT_03_02.jpg" /></div></div></div>
