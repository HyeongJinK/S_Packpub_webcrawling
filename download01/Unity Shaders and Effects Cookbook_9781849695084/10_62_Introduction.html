<span class="strong"><strong>post effects</strong></span>. With these screen effects, we can create stunning looking real-time images with Bloom, Motion Blur, HDR effects, and so on. Most modern games out on the market today make heavy use of these screen effects, for their <span class="strong"><strong>depth of field</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DOF</strong></span>)<a id="id535" class="indexterm"></a> effects, their bloom effects, and even their color correction effects.</p><p>Throughout this chapter we will learn how to build up the script system that gives us the control to create these screen effects. We will learn about render textures, what the depth buffer is, and how to create effects that give you Photoshop-like control over the final rendered image of your game. By utilizing screen effects for your games, you not only round out your Shader-writing knowledge, but you will gain the power to create your own incredible real-time renders with Unity.</p></div>
