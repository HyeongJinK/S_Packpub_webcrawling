One of the aspects to real-time games is the effect of immersing a player into a world to make it feel as if they were actually playing in the real world. The more modern games make heavy use of screen effects to achieve this immersion.</p><p>With screen effects, we can turn the mood of a certain environment from calm to scary, just by changing the look of the screen.

Many modern games will turn on different screen effects to change the mood of the current moment. Understanding how to create effects triggered by <a id="id611" class="indexterm"></a>gameplay is next in our journey of Shader writing.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to take a look at some of the more common gameplay screen effects. We are going to learn how to change the look of the game from normal to an old movie effect, and we are going to take a look at how many first-person shooter games apply their night vision effects to the screen. With each of these recipes, we are going to look at how to hook these up to game events, so that they are turned on and off as the game's current presentation needs it.</p></div>
