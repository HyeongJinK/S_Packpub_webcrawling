Unfortunately, you have to be very careful about how many textures you use in your Shader as they can add up really quickly, and that will increasingly hit performance the more textures you add to your Shader. This is especially true for mobile solutions where you need to keep the amount of textures to a minimum, so that your application downloads faster and runs faster.</p><p>Textures themselves are images that are usually created in an image editing application, such as <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>Photoshop, but can also be created inside of Unity itself. Textures themselves are mapped to the surface of an object by using the UVs of the object to create a relationship between the 2D point in the UVs, and the 3D point of a vertex. The pixel values are then interpolated between the vertices of the object to create the illusion of the 2D image being mapped on to the 3D surface.</p><p>We have already set up a texture property in the last chapter, so we won't have to cover that again, but if you would like to know more about the inner workings of how <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>textures are mapped to a 3D surface, you can read the information available at <a class="ulink" href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter03.html" target="_blank">http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter03.html</a>.</p><p>Let's start by taking a look at what we can do with textures and how they can make our real-time 3D visuals even more interesting and compelling. This chapter is going to start with some very basic textures effects, and then take you into the more advanced world of texturing for materials and Shaders.</p></div>
