We will see that there are several animations that can be easily handled by Unity3D's Physics. During development, you will come to know that working with animations and Physics is easy in Unity3D. You will find the combination of Physics and animation very interesting.</p><p>We are going to cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Interpolate and Extrapolate</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Cloth component and its uses in animation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>ConstantForce</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>AddForce</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>AddTorque</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An example of creating a rope animation using different joints</p></li></ul></div></div>
