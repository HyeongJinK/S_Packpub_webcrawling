<span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody dynamics</strong></span>
<a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a> is the most common component used in interactive development. For Physics-based simulation development, we use algorithms of<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> Rigidbody dynamics. Rigidbody dynamics is based on the Newtonian principle of movement and mass.</p><p>Now, the question that arises here is what is a Rigidbody? An idealized solid whose size and shape is fixed and remains unaltered when some external forces are applied and is used in Newtonian mechanics to model real objects is known as a Rigidbody. For example, a box, wall, and so on.</p><p>The use of accurate Physics in interactive development is not feasible as it has its own natural constraints. In interactive development, we cannot use accurate Physics due to the standard frame rate restrictions, but the physical accuracy of a simulation only needs to be believable.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"></a>Use of Physics in simulation and frame rate</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to use Physics for interactive development, there are many things that need to be taken care of. Physics simulations<a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a> are related <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>to the frame rate. The frame rate can be described as the number of frames that are displayed per second. This is relevant to animation, in which many images are displayed quickly to give the impression of movement. The standard frame rate for most PCs and console games is 60 fps.</p><p>The interval of moving objects with their trajectories is called Physics simulation. Almost every Physics simulation equation involves time, and the time required for solving this is determined by interactive development.</p></div></div>
