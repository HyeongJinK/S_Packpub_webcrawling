We have learned how we can apply a fixed joint to fix two Rigidbodies together, a spring joint for spring-like behavior, a hinge joint to create door animation, and a character joint for a Ragdoll effect.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn about animation and Unity3D Physics. It will focus on the different animations, for example, rope animation, use of add force and add torque, and constant force.</p></div>
