Saving and loading from an XML file allows you to get more details on how you save your data. An XML file is made up of tagged lines that allow you to load or save specific data for easier usage. Create a new C# script and name it <code class="literal">XML_Save_System</code>. Before we write the code to save and load to XML, we need to first create our XML files.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec104"></a>Creating our XML files</h3></div></div></div><p>To create<a id="id437" class="indexterm"></a> XML files, we use a program called <a id="id438" class="indexterm"></a>Notepad++, a free-to-use text editor. Notepad++ is a handy tool to have for situations like these; you can download Notepad++ free of cost from <a id="id439" class="indexterm"></a>
<a class="ulink" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>.</p><p>When you open Notepad++, you should first select <span class="strong"><strong>Language</strong></span> at the top of the screen and select <span class="strong"><strong>XML</strong></span>. This will set the current document to use the XML language. </p><p>Next, we start adding our tags. First, we make the <code class="literal">PlayerData</code> XML file. Add these lines so that your XML file looks like mine:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553631/graphics/3631OT_07_01.jpg" /></div><p>The first <a id="id440" class="indexterm"></a>tag or node that we create is the <code class="literal">pData</code> tag, which <a id="id441" class="indexterm"></a>will be our root node. This will be used to anchor our data and other nodes. The rest of the nodes will be what we save to and load our data from. The actual order of these nodes is irrelevant as long as they're within the root node. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button, and name this file <code class="literal">PlayerData</code>. Be sure to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save as type</strong></span> option below the filename and select the <span class="strong"><strong>XML</strong></span> option.</p><p>Next, we will create the <code class="literal">EnemyData</code> XML file. Open a new file in Notepad++, and add these lines to your new XML file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553631/graphics/3631OT_07_02.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, this new XML file has a similar structure to that of the <code class="literal">PlayerData</code> XML file. Our root node is <code class="literal">eData</code>, and after that, we have an enemy node. The enemy node holds the rest of the nodes that we save to and load from almost like a <a id="id442" class="indexterm"></a>class or object. You can consider the <a id="id443" class="indexterm"></a>enemy to be a class and the child nodes within it as the class's properties. The reason we are doing this is to save multiple enemies to our XML file, and they will each have their own data.</p><p>Finally, save this file in the same way you did the <code class="literal">PlayerData</code> XML file, but name this one <code class="literal">EnemyData</code>. I have placed both of these files to the desktop for testing purposes. Normally, you would keep your saved files in the same directory as your game or in some hidden location.</p></div></div>
