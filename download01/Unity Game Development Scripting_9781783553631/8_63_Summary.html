To play background music we created two unique systems, a random based system and a playlist styled system. Our atmospheric sounds are easy to play as we used a key-based system to call and play sounds with ease. We made a simple yet effective event-based system to play sound effects.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will go over the optimization of our game. We will cover how to adjust the graphics, sound, lighting, and many more options to make our games effective and smooth across all platforms.</p></div>
