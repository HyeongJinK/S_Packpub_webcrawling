You also learned how to change preset control schemes, as well as swap the controls. You can now create a game that will support both the keyboard/mouse and Xbox 360 Controller. This is something that is pivotal to games and game design; not everyone likes to use non-customizable controls.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll go over how to utilize the GUI more in depth. You will learn about how to create 3D GUI elements as well as 2D elements. Later on in this book, we will use these new GUI elements to create a more engaging experience.</p></div>
