You may find other ways to create an inventory, but this method should suffice to add an inventory to any game that you create. With this inventory, you can add items, remove items, have multiples of items, set some quick-items, and finally show the inventory as a GUI display.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will create Artificial Intelligence, more commonly known as AI. We'll create a simple behavior system to call different events that the AI can do. The AI will run what we'll call internal events, essentially doing stuff that affects the AI GameObject itself. Next we'll create external events, which are actions that will cause the AI to affect other GameObjects such as attacking or moving around the game world. Finally, we'll create an AI manager and learn how to play character animations.</p></div>
