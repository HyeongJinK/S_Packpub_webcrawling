We explored a couple of techniques to handle AI, such as finite state machines and behavior trees. Then, we dived into AI actions, both internal and external. From there, we figured out how to implement pathfinding with both a waypoint system and Unity's NavMesh system. Finally, we topped the AI package off with animations and put everything together, creating our finalized AI.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to create a stat tracking system. To do this, we will add stats and attributes to the player and enemies. Then, we will track stats for both the player and enemies. We will also add an achievement system for some of the stats.</p></div>
