To track the stats, we created interactive functions to modify them. During the creation of the stat saving script, you learned about what <code class="literal">PlayerPref</code> function are and how to use them. You also learned how to keep track of achievements and show them on a GUI menu as well.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to add the <span class="emphasis"><em>save game</em></span> functionality to your game. To save the game data, we will create two methods, allowing the player to save the game anytime they want and allowing the game to use checkpoint saving.
