First, you started off by learning the traditional way of creating the GUI by making buttons, bars, and text. Then, we switched gears and learned how to make a 3D GUI by making 3D health bars, 3D damage reports, and 3D name tags.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to make a few different classes for in-game items. First, we'll create a class so that items will affect the player, the next class will allow items to affect other objects on touch, and the final class will  be created for projectiles. All of these can be used for the player, enemies, or environment objects.</p></div>
