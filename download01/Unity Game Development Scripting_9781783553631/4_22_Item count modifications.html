This can be done in the following ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Buying, selling, and trading items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Dropping and picking up items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Destroying or using items</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec50"></a>Item bartering</h3></div></div></div><p>If your <a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a>game has a lot of items in its world, you <a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a>might have included shops within that world. In these shops, the player can sell their items or buy more items. This method is very common in role-playing games, as these types of games have many items. Another way to barter items is to trade them. This can be done in offline games, but this is mostly seen in online games where players can use a menu system to trade their items.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec51"></a>Dropping and picking up items</h3></div></div></div><p>When<a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a> the player's inventory is full or almost full, they <a id="id188" class="indexterm"></a>might come across an item<a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a> that<a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a> they want. If the option is made available, the player can drop an item they don't want anymore and pick up the new item to replace it. Dropping an item can insert it back in the game world or simply destroy it. Picking up an item can be done by walking over it or selecting it with a key or button.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec52"></a>Destroying and using items</h3></div></div></div><p>If the player <a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a>has a bow, they will most likely <a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a>have a multitude of arrows to shoot. When<a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a> these arrows are shot, the number of arrows will go down. Once <a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a>all arrows have been shot, the arrows will no longer be in their inventory, since the player has used them all. Using healing items might also modify how many healing items are left, unless the items are designed to stay in the inventory without a limit on usage.</p><p>Destroying an item can be done manually by the player if they no longer want to keep that item. There can also be a condition stat on a weapon or a piece of armor. When the condition gets too low, the item will be destroyed in the inventory, making it unusable. Another way to destroy an item is to assign it a certain number of uses; once it exceeds this number of uses, it can be destroyed automatically.</p></div></div>
