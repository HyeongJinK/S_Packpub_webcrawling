We created various settings for video as well as audio configurations. We then finally created a GUI menu to allow the player to modify the settings and optimize their game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll create a small game that will feature all of the gameplay features that we created throughout this book. By doing this, you will get a great example of how to implement everything you learned so far.</p></div>
