First, we created a class of items that would affect the player upon activation. Then, we delved into a class for melee items that affect other GameObjects. Finally, we created a class for projectile items. All of these classes have similar properties and methods, yet each one is used slightly different each time.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will go over how to create an inventory system. First, we will figure out how to make a storage system that fits our game. Next, we'll create a GUI-based interface system so that the player can interact with their inventory easily. Finally, we'll create a <span class="emphasis"><em>Quick Equip</em></span> system. This will allow the player to equip or use various items by using hot keys either on the screen, on their keyboard, or on their controller without pausing to go to the inventory menu.</p></div>
