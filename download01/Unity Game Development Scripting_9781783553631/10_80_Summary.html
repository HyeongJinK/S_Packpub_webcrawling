This was the final chapter and it utilized all that we created in the previous chapters. In this book, you learned how to make a GUI system, create AI, create items, save and load game data, create a sound system, and much more. Then, using what you learned, you were able to create a short game demonstrating most of what we did throughout the book. Now is the time to move beyond this book and create your own games.</p></div>
