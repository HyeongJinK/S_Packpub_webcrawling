Having others experience your world and enjoy it is very rewarding.</p><p>We will learn how to deploy our games so that we can run them on different platforms and share them with our family, friends, and the public.</p><p>Also, while developing our game, we need to test the game we are creating on its target platform so that we can test its unique platform-specific features.</p><p>To deploy our game, we do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings…</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you are in the first scene by clicking on the scene twice in the Project Browser, and then add the current scene in <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, make<a id="id749" class="indexterm"></a> sure you are in the second scene by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Scene2</strong></span> twice in the Project Browser, and then add the current scene in <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>. Make sure that they are both ticked.</p></li><li><p>Select your target platform (in this case, PC). Select whether or not it is for 32-bit or 64-bit and whether it is a release build or development build.</p></li><li><p>A development build is usually slower than the release build and contains extra features to debug.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings…</strong></span> button has extra settings, whereby we can add our own icon and splash an image for our game.</p></li><li><p>We simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button, save our game to the location of choice, and give our game a name (in this case, <code class="literal">Space Buddy</code>).</p></li><li><p>We now have our very own PC game executable (the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file).</p></li><li><p>When we open it, we can select its settings and even edit the game controls, giving even greater flexibility.</p></li><li><p>Follow the same steps for all other platforms; however, each will have its own extra requirements. For instance, for iOS deployment, you will require a Mac with Xcode, and for Android mobile devices, you will require the Android SDK.</p></li><li><p>Had we chosen Web Player, we would receive an HTML file that we could double-click to play within our browser offline. We can then host it on a website for others to enjoy online.</p></li></ol></div><p>The following screenshot displays the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> screen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_10_16.jpg" /></div></div>
