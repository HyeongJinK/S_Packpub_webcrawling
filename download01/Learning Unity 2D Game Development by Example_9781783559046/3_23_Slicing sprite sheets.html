As we are using multiple images, we need to slice the sprite sheet to separate the clubbed images into their individual images.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"></a>Sprite Editor</h3></div></div></div><p>To slice <a id="id173" class="indexterm"></a>a sprite sheet, we need to open the <a id="id174" class="indexterm"></a>Sprite Editor either by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> within the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> toolbar during Import settings or by first selecting the image in the Project Browser as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_08.jpg" /></div><p>We then navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_09.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"></a>Manual slicing</h3></div></div></div><p>To slice <a id="id175" class="indexterm"></a>each image into its own sprite manually, we first drag and select the image within the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window. A blue selection area box will then be displayed as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_10.jpg" /></div><p>We resize<a id="id176" class="indexterm"></a> the selection area by dragging and moving the handles on the corners of the box to fit around one of the multiple images. We do the same for all the other images within the sprite sheet. We can also name, set the size, and position the box within the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> box as shown in the following screenshot (Unity only supports rectangular sprite cuts):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_11.jpg" /></div><p>We need to name our sprites as we will refer to them when animating them and coding scripts. This also makes it easier and clearer to view and find the sprite within the scene and hierarchy. We<a id="id177" class="indexterm"></a> can enter the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> coordinates as well as the width and height that we would like for the selection area within the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> settings. We can also trim the selection area by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Trim</strong></span> button. This will resize the selection area to surround the image much closer, removing unnecessary space.</p><p>Lastly, we can set the pivot location for the selection area by selecting our choice from the drop-down box and then clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> at the top-right corner of <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>.</p><p>Pivots are used to define the center position of a sprite and also its center of rotation. The <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Pivot</strong></span> choice allows a user to define a pivot location on the sprite that offers more flexibility when needed.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec24"></a>Adding and removing a selection area</h4></div></div></div><p>To create a<a id="id178" class="indexterm"></a> new selection area, we simply<a id="id179" class="indexterm"></a> click and hold anywhere within the sprite sheet and then drag. A green selection area will appear. The more we drag, the larger the size of the selection area. Once we release the mouse and therefore the selection area, it will turn blue to indicate that we have created the selection area. We can then resize and edit if we need to do any tweaks to it. The following screenshot shows a new selection area being created with the green selection area box being dragged to surround the moustache of the character:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_12.jpg" /></div><p>To<a id="id180" class="indexterm"></a> remove a selection area, we simply <a id="id181" class="indexterm"></a>select the one that we would like to remove and then press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> button on our keyboard.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec25"></a>Toolbar controls</h4></div></div></div><p>The top-right<a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a> corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window consists of a colored bar button, which enables us to toggle the view of the image and its alpha channels.
