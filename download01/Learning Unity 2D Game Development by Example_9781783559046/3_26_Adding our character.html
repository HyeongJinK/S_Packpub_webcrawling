A drop-down box will appear with the option to rename the GameObject as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_28.jpg" /></div><p>Currently the Scene View should look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_30.jpg" /></div><p>Now that the <a id="id202" class="indexterm"></a>GameObject appears as a character, we select the remaining body parts that will make up our character from the Project Browser, drag them to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, and drop them over the character so that the character becomes the parent and all the other parts are the children.</p><p>This is to ensure that the body parts are locked to the character and inherit any changes that are <a id="id203" class="indexterm"></a>applied to the character; for instance, when we move the character, all the parts move relative to the character. Otherwise, any position change with the character would have resulted with the need to change all the positions of each and every body part.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab should now look as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_31.jpg" /></div></div>
