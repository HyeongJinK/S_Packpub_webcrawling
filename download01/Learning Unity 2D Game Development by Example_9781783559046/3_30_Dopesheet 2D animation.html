The word Dopesheet is derived from its traditional use in cartoons and film/TV. Similar to a storyboard, it is used in planning animations using frames and sections.</p><p>To <a id="id219" class="indexterm"></a>create a reusable animation clip for our character <a id="id220" class="indexterm"></a>of it breathing, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>We select the character, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Clip</strong></span> drop-down box, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Clip</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We then select <code class="literal">Idle</code> as the name of our animation and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now we select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Curve</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>A drop-down box will appear giving us several options.</p></li><li><p>We <a id="id221" class="indexterm"></a>click on <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> to open all the<a id="id222" class="indexterm"></a> transform properties and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> by clicking on the plus button next to it as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_38.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>We will animate our character breathing by moving its body's position up and down slightly.</p></li><li><p>We need<a id="id223" class="indexterm"></a> to reduce the <span class="strong"><strong>frames per second</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>) from <code class="literal">60</code> down to <code class="literal">10</code> so that the animation is slower and smoother as this property controls how many frames are played per second.</p></li><li><p>The record button should already be pressed down when the button is red because adding a new curve automatically enables recording. If we have accidentally disabled it, we press the record button and move our character up slightly in the Scene View or the Inspector to change its position for the first frame. This will add a key to the frame resulting in a key frame. When moving our character within the Scene View, we can hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key while dragging to ensure that we move it in a straight path and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> key snaps the sprite along a grid defined in <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Snap Settings</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We then type <code class="literal">5</code> within the current key frame to add a new key frame, and move the character down again.</p></li><li><p>Finally we add <code class="literal">10</code> to the current key frame and move the character up once again to add the final key frame.</p></li><li><p>We then <a id="id224" class="indexterm"></a>click on the record button <a id="id225" class="indexterm"></a>to stop recording and press play to view our animation. We must not forget to stop recording! Otherwise, we will inadvertently record things in our animation that we did not mean to.</p></li><li><p>To delete any key frames, click on the key frames to select them, and then press <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now when we play our game from the Game View, we will see our character animatingâ€”our character is alive!</p></li></ol></div></div>
