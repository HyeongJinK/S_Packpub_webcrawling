The game consisted of a background, an animated hero that shoots projectiles, animated enemies that randomly spawn and follow the hero, and permadeath once a collision is detected. In the next chapter, we will learn about game conditions and how to display them on the screen by implementing a HUD with all the UI elements in a classic arcade game.</p></div>
