<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec31"></a>Sprite Renderer</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>When we <a id="id204" class="indexterm"></a>select the character parent or any of its children, the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component will display this selection within the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> toolbar. It contains all the settings that affect how the image will be rendered (in other words, how the image's appearance is displayed). The following screenshot shows us the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component in Unity:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_32.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> field contains the reference to the sprite asset that the GameObject is using. Should we <a id="id205" class="indexterm"></a>want to replace the image that the GameObject is using, we<a id="id206" class="indexterm"></a> simply need to click on the circle (highlighted) as in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_33.jpg" /></div><p>This will open the sprite asset folder allowing us to pick any asset that we have added to our project. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_34.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> field<a id="id207" class="indexterm"></a> is a blend mode that multiplies the color selected <a id="id208" class="indexterm"></a>with the sprite's original color. As we would like to keep the sprite's original color, we leave this setting at the default white. If we wanted to change the color, we simply click on the color box or color picker next to it.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> field<a id="id209" class="indexterm"></a> allows us to select the material we would like to use, which affects the image's rendering properties as well as the assets used. We can leave this as the default material. If we want to change it, we can simply click on the circle beside the setting, which will open the material asset folder.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sorting Layer</strong></span> option<a id="id210" class="indexterm"></a> is where we group a selection of sprites that we want to display on the same layer. We will leave this at its default settings.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Order in Layer</strong></span> option<a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a> specifies which order we want the selected layer to appear. As we want the body of the character to appear in front<a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a> of the bazooka, we leave the bazooka's <span class="strong"><strong>Order in Layer</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> and set the character's <span class="strong"><strong>Order in Layer</strong></span> option to <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span>. Depending on the order, we drag the parts we may need to adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Order in Layer</strong></span> option of a few of the other parts.</p><p>We will now need to move the body parts of the character within the Scene View so that they appear in the correct positions. The result should appear as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_35.jpg" /></div></div>
