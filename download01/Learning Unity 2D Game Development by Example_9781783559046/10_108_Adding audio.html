<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch10lvl1sec105"></a>Adding audio</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>For the<a id="id713" class="indexterm"></a> first time, we will be adding audio to our game. We<a id="id714" class="indexterm"></a> will add sound effects for Space Buddy's jumps that will play each time he jumps on a platform as well as a sound effect when he dies and when he enters the UFO beam successfully, completing the level.</p><p>To add the sound effects, let's execute the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Add a folder to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> within the Project Browser and name it <code class="literal">Audio</code>.</p></li><li><p>Download <a id="id715" class="indexterm"></a>the audio wave file <code class="literal">spin_jump.wav</code> from the following URL:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://soundbible.com/1898-Spin-Jump.html" target="_blank">http://soundbible.com/1898-Spin-Jump.html</a>
</p></li><li><p>Drag the audio file into the <code class="literal">Audio</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>If we <a id="id716" class="indexterm"></a>click on the imported audio asset file, we <a id="id717" class="indexterm"></a>can select whether it is a 3D sound (sound manipulated to appear as if it is originating within a specific point in 3D space) or not, as well as its compression settings and therefore file size. When creating games for mobile platforms for instance, we need to keep files compressed and small in size. This does have a minimal effect on the audio quality. For a few very short sound effects, native (uncompressed) audio files can be used; they will not need to be decoded during runtime, thereby reducing runtime processing.</p></li><li><p>We <a id="id718" class="indexterm"></a>repeat the preceding steps for <code class="literal">jingles_NES00.ogg</code> and <code class="literal">jingles_NES01.ogg</code> from SFX Jingles at the <a id="id719" class="indexterm"></a>following URL:</p><p>
