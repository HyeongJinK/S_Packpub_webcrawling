These various input types can form part of the exciting features that our games have to offer. The following image displays the different input types:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046_05_02.jpg" /></div><p>The <a id="id344" class="indexterm"></a>most widely used input types in games include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Keyboard</strong></span>: Key<a id="id345" class="indexterm"></a> presses from a keyboard are supported<a id="id346" class="indexterm"></a> by Unity and can be used as input controls in PC games as well as games on any other device that supports a keyboard.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mouse</strong></span>: Mouse <a id="id347" class="indexterm"></a>clicks, motion (of the mouse), and <a id="id348" class="indexterm"></a>coordinates are all inputs that are supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game controller</strong></span>: This<a id="id349" class="indexterm"></a> is an input device that <a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a>generally includes buttons (including shoulder and trigger buttons), a directional pad, and analog sticks. The game controller input is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Joystick</strong></span>: A joystick<a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a> has a stick that pivots on a base that provides movement input in the form of direction and angle. It also has a trigger, throttle, and extra buttons. It is commonly used in flight simulation games to simulate the control device in an aircraft's cockpit and other simulation games that simulate controlling machines, such as trucks and<a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a> cranes. Modern game controllers make use of a <a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a>variation of joysticks known as analog sticks and are therefore treated <a id="id354" class="indexterm"></a>as the same class of input device as joysticks by Unity. Joystick input is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Microphone</strong></span>: This<a id="id355" class="indexterm"></a> provides audio input commands <a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a>for a game. Unity supports basic microphone input. For greater fidelity, a third-party audio recognition tool would be required.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span>: This <a id="id357" class="indexterm"></a>provides visual input for a game using<a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a> image recognition. Unity has webcam support to access RGB data, and for more advanced features, third-party tools would be required.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Touchscreen</strong></span>: This <a id="id359" class="indexterm"></a>provides multiple touch inputs <a id="id360" class="indexterm"></a>from the player's finger presses on the device's screen. This is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Accelerometer</strong></span>: This <a id="id361" class="indexterm"></a>provides the proper acceleration <a id="id362" class="indexterm"></a>force at which the device is moved and is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gyroscope</strong></span>: This <a id="id363" class="indexterm"></a>provides the orientation of the <a id="id364" class="indexterm"></a>device as input and is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>GPS</strong></span>: This<a id="id365" class="indexterm"></a> provides the geographical location of the<a id="id366" class="indexterm"></a> device as input and is supported by Unity.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Stylus</strong></span>: Stylus<a id="id367" class="indexterm"></a> input is similar to touchscreen input in<a id="id368" class="indexterm"></a> that you use a stylus to interact with the screen; however, it provides greater precision. The latest version of Unity supports the Android stylus.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Motion controller</strong></span>: This <a id="id369" class="indexterm"></a>provides the player's<a id="id370" class="indexterm"></a> motions as input. Unity does not support this, and therefore, third-party tools would be required.</p></li></ul></div></div>
