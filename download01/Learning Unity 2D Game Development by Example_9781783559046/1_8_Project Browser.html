A child's translation, rotation, and scale will be relative to the parent. So, we only need to edit the parent's relative transform data and the children will inherit them. This is useful for animating multiple separate images by changing their position. For instance, if we have an arm and a hand image, then we make the arm the parent and the hand the child, once we do this, we only need to move the arm and the hand will move in relation to it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04"></a>Creating GameObjects</h4></div></div></div><p>When<a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a> we<a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a> click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>, we are given a list of preconfigured GameObjects that we can create, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_01_17.jpg" /></div><p>Although the list may appear daunting, we will not need to concern ourselves with many of these<a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a> GameObjects as<a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a> most of them are used for 3D games.

For example, the Audio Source component allows a game object to emit a sound, while a Script component allows a game object to behave intelligently or respond to user input.</p><p>When we click on a GameObject within our scene, the Inspector provides detailed information about that object. It displays all the components that have been added to the selected GameObject, such as animations, colliders, scripts, and so on, as well as all the attributes within the components. This allows us to directly modify its fields and their respective values<a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a> from the Inspector.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>We can also change the values during runtime to test the effect in real time while running the game. However, this is only used to temporarily test the effect of the changes. Once we stop the game, the values will revert to their previous settings. Therefore, only the changes we make while not running the game are saved instantly.</p></div><p>We can reset any changes by right-clicking on the component and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>reset</strong></span>.</p><p>By clicking on the red, green, and blue cubes in the top-left corner, we can set an icon to label our GameObject within Scene View, making it easier to find them.</p><p>Whenever we do not want a component active at any time, we can simply deselect the component by deselecting the box. We do this to temporarily turn it off without losing its settings, because had we deleted it, then we would have lost any changes made to the default settings.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_01_18.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec05"></a>Adding components</h4></div></div></div><p>To add a<a id="id50" class="indexterm"></a> component to the selected GameObject, we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> button.
