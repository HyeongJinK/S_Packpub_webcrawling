We have kept it stationary since the games that we created had no need for a moving <a id="id692" class="indexterm"></a>camera. However, most games will require camera movement, which will include panning, rotating, zooming, camera cuts, and so forth.</p><p>As with any GameObject in our scene, we can move a camera in the same manner using <code class="literal">transform.Translate</code>, as in the following script:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">cam.transform.Translate(Vector3.up * camSpeed * Time.deltaTime);</pre></div><p>For camera cuts or switching between cameras, we create multiple cameras by going to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> and using the enabled property of the Camera component <code class="literal">cameraName.enabled</code>, as in the following script:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var cam1 : Camera;
var cam2 : Camera;
