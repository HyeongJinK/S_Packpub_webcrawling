For instance, as their very basis, most games usually have a beginning and an end, which is similar to most other media, such as books, movies, and so on.</p><p>Mostly, this is due to the game following a story, however, even games that have no story still follow <a id="id510" class="indexterm"></a>these rules as they provide a sense of completion and progression for the player.</p><p>There are even games that take this notion further by adding beats to the story with a climax and anticlimax providing the player with a sense of pace and allowing them to experience action-packed, adrenaline-pumping moments followed by slow-paced moments that allow them to rest.</p><p>And even still, there are other games that use foreshadowing moments to build up tension, which is very common in action, adventure, and horror games. However, the endless runner genre removes all that and allows players to play for as long as they would like, provided they survive that.</p><p>Since the game never truly ends, the player can enjoy the game over and over again. In order to create a game that has no beginning and ending, endless runners make use of random repetition to ensure that the game feels unique each time the player plays it.</p><p>The great advantage<a id="id511" class="indexterm"></a> of this genre is that it provides an infinite amount of replay ability. Also, endless runners are far simpler and quicker to create; creating them is much simpler than creating bespoke levels.</p><p>With endless runners, we simply create the basic logic, and then the game will randomly create a unique experience with each play.</p></div>
