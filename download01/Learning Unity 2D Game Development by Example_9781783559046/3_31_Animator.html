For example, when a character is in a jumping state, Unity will automatically enable the jump animation. We define which character states correspond to the animations in the Animator View.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To open the Animator, we go to the main toolbar and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> Window will open and look as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_39.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, we add our character's idle animation to the Animator by simply dragging the idle animation from the Project Browser and dropping it into the Animator View.</p></li><li><p>We then right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Any State</strong></span> option within the Animator, select <span class="strong"><strong>Make Transition</strong></span>, and then click on the idle animation state. We now have the any <a id="id227" class="indexterm"></a>state transitioning into the idle animation. </p></li><li><p>We use <span class="strong"><strong>Any State</strong></span> when we want to jump to a state (an animation to play) no matter what state our character is in.</p></li><li><p>We then right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>idle</strong></span> state and select <span class="strong"><strong>Set As Default</strong></span> to set the idle state to run when we first run the game. By default, this should already be the case, and therefore, <span class="strong"><strong>Set As Default</strong></span> will be grayed out but is worth noting in case we accidentally set a different animation state as default.</p></li></ol></div><p>The Animator View should now look as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046OT_03_40.jpg" /></div><p>Run the<a id="id228" class="indexterm"></a> scene/game by pressing play in the Game View to see our character come alive!</p></div>
