We will look at their functions, importance, and differentiations.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec48"></a>Input in games</h3></div></div></div><p>Input may not seem a very important part of a game at first glance, but in fact it is very important, as input in <a id="id340" class="indexterm"></a>games involves how the player will interact with the game. All the controls in our game, such as moving, special abilities, and so forth, depend on what controls and game mechanics we would like in our game and the way we would like them to function.</p><p>Most games have the standard control setup of moving your character. This is to help usability, because if players are already familiar with the controls, then the game is more accessible to a much wider audience. This is particularly noticeable with games of the same genre and platform.</p><p>For instance, endless runner games usually make use of the <span class="emphasis"><em>tilt mechanic</em></span> which is made possible by the features of the mobile device. However, there are variations and additions to the pre-existing control mechanics; for example, many other endless runners make use of the simple swipe mechanic, and there are those that make use of both.</p><p>When designing our games, we can be creative and unique with our controls, thereby innovating a game, but the controls still need to be intuitive for our target players. When first designing our game, we need to know who our target audience of players includes. If we would like our game to be played by young children, for instance, then we need to ensure that they are able to understand, learn, and remember the controls. Otherwise, instead of enjoying the game, they will get frustrated and stop playing it entirely.</p><p>As an example, a young player may hold a touchscreen device with their fingers over the screen, thereby preventing the input from working correctly depending on whether the game was first designed to take this into account and support this.</p><p>Different audiences of players interact with a game differently. Likewise, if a player is more familiar with the controls on a specific device, then they may struggle with different controls. It is important to create prototypes to test the input controls of a game thoroughly. Developing a well-designed input system that supports usability and accessibility will make our game more immersive.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec49"></a>Output in games</h3></div></div></div><p>Output is the direct opposite of input; it provides the necessary information to the player. However, output<a id="id341" class="indexterm"></a> is just as essential to a game as input. It provides feedback to the player, letting them know how they are doing. Output lets the player know whether they have done an action correctly or they have done something wrong, how they have performed, and their progression in the form of goals/missions/objectives.</p><p>Without<a id="id342" class="indexterm"></a> feedback, a player would feel lost. The player would potentially see the game as being unclear, buggy, or even broken. For certain types of games, output forms the heart of the game.</p><p>The input in a game gets processed by the game to provide some form of output, which then provides feedback to the player, helping them learn from their actions. This is the cycle of the game's input-output system.</p><p>The following diagram represents the cycle of input and output:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559046/graphics/9046_05_01.jpg" /></div></div></div>
