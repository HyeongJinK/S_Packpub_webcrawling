Similar to a collision, should one GameObject enter the trigger's area, then the script can be set up to trigger events on a successful overlap.</p><p>Thus, to create a trigger, we go to <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics 2D</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> and then tick the <span class="strong"><strong>Is Trigger</strong></span> setting.</p><p>The collider is no longer a collision, but now a trigger. In the script, we now replace the <code class="literal">OnCollisionEnter2D</code> function that we have been using with the trigger equivalent, that is, the <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D</code> function.</p></div>
