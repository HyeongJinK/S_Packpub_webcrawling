When game development was still in its early beginnings, the former was more common; however, as the technology behind game creation improved, it became more difficult and expensive for an individual to create even a simple game from scratch. In order to do so, you needed to create a game engineâ€”the core of a game that runs all the different technological components needed to support a game.</p><p>Game engines were built from scratch for a specific game genre, and they took a long amount of time, effort, and resources. It was a complex task that usually required advanced knowledge of math, science, and programming. Although, since the fundamentals of game development come down to the same principles, it is more efficient to build upon the foundations instead of reinventing the wheel.</p><p>Therefore, game <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>engines and game-authoring tools became readily available and more general purpose for the mainstream public who were interested in pursuing game development. Instead of worrying about the functionality, we can now concentrate more on the gameplay.</p></div>
