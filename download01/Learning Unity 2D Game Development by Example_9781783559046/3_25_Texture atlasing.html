However, the image will usually have a lot of empty space surrounding it, and this takes up video memory during runtime (when the game is running), which impacts performance. In order to reduce the wastage and optimize performance, we make use of texture atlasing. A technique called <a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>draw call batching</strong></span> that Unity and other engines use also helps to improve the frame rate. It too requires texture atlasing particularly for PC games, whereby a complex 2D scene would probably become CPU-bound.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"></a>What is a texture atlas?</h3></div></div></div><p>A texture atlas<a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a> packs several separate images (textures) into a single texture.
