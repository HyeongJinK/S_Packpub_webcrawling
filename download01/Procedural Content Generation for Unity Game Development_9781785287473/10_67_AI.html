We can use PCG to enhance certain aspects of AI. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adaptive Difficulty</em></span>, we used PCG to rewrite a section of our AI. This isn't always the most practical approach though.</p><p>AI for games can be<a id="id437" class="indexterm"></a> easily visualized as a state machine or a graph of connected behaviors. Some actions in the AI graph might lead to others or some situations might cause an AI to enact a certain behavior. In the following diagram, we see rectangles represented as states and arrows representing states transitioning into other states. This network of states can be as complex or simple as we like.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>AI state machine</p></div></div><p>An example of a complex AI state machine is Bethesda's Radiant AI. This AI system has the NPCs react to the actions of the player, but also has them generate a daily routine. They can go to work, travel, and some might set out to attempt assassinations. These behaviors are programmed separately, but then the routine is generated at runtime.</p><p>Thinking of AI behaviors<a id="id438" class="indexterm"></a> as content that can be manipulated allows us to use the principles of PCG to generate and manipulate our AI in-game. However, there are many more ways to implement artificial intelligence other than using a state machine. With that in mind, it would be a good start to study artificial intelligence in general to find the best ways to apply PCG to it.</p></div>
