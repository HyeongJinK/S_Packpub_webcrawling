You made a 2D <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game that can continually generate game content for as long as the player can survive. However, with our 2D game complete, it's time to add another dimension to our PCG learning and move into 3D.</p><p>In this chapter, we will be procedurally generating a 3D planet. You can see an example of a procedurally generated shape in the following figure. Then, just for fun, we'll add the scripts necessary to take a first person view walk on that planet. However, 3D does pose some new considerations when applying PCG. Here's what you can expect to learn in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>2D versus 3D rendering</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Space and time complexity of 3D object generation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>3D geometry considerations with PCG</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_09_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A procedurally generated sphere</p></div></div></li></ul></div><p>Generating 3D objects is<a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a> basically graphics programming. Math can be used to describe everything around us in a geometric sense. Then, we take that math and make it an algorithm for drawing points and lines on a graph and rendering it to our screen. Graphics programming is a very interesting and spectacular subfield of computer science, but be prepared to study lots of advanced mathematics to get good at it.</p><p>We will be dealing with more math in this chapter than the previous ones. Since graphics programming is a vast subject that has many books already written about it, the explanations of the mathematics will be brief. These are just equations that can be looked up and researched at your leisure. So without further delay, let's start learning some PCG in 3D.</p></div>
