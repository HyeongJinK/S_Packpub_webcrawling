Usually, these state machines are much less complicated though. There are certain things that can't be generated well quite yet like voiceovers in terms of tone and conveying emotion.</p><p>Players have come to expect a certain level of storytelling so when certain things are difficult to produce, it narrows the availability of additions like multiple storylines. What keeps procedural storytelling to a minimum is the fact that what makes a good story is very subjective. Physics and graphics are all based on hard math but story is based on opinion. And we don't want to deliver a subpar story to our player.</p><p>With that in mind, we could map out elements to a story or several stories combined. Then, we could either randomly choose the arrangement of story path states that we want the player to follow, or we could react to the player's behavior in certain events. This is the typical approach as of right now, but usually on a very subtle scale.</p><p>You can think of Bethesda's <span class="emphasis"><em>The Elder Scrolls</em></span> series or BioWare's <span class="emphasis"><em>Mass Effect</em></span> series as examples of how a player-driven story would look and feel. The outcome of the story is generally the same or, at most, has a few variants. In general, we see more success in generating micro-stories like quests, which is something we see in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</em></span> as part of the Radiant Quests system.</p><p>In theory, though, you can generate whole stories given the right formula and variables. This is much like generating music. There is a structure to a story with certain areas that can be interchangeable like the sounds of a song. To fully understand the formula and extent of a story, you would need to research creative storytelling, just like you would research music theory to better generate music.</p></div>
