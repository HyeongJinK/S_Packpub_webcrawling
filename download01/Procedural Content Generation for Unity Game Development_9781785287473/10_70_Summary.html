You should be willing to explore the more involved route of fleshing out the modules or states to provide the player the best possible experience. In some cases, you should look to constrain your PCG to some parameters and tight bounds, while other times, you might want to turn over control to the payer entirely and let them choose their own fate.</p><p>In this chapter, we discussed the many ways we can apply PCG. However, the discussion of PCG goes far beyond this book and Unity. You did learn the different areas to begin your research of PCG in and the various fields in which it can be applied.</p><p>PCG is a great idea. We can generate whole universes at runtime, making our file size incredibly small while making our game incredibly huge. We can use it to spend less time designing art for our game by reusing art modules in inventive ways. We can make every playthrough of a game unique.</p><p>PCG is not a new concept, but as computers become more capable so does PCG. Fewer people can do more by making game development PCG heavy and using it wisely. PCG has a bright and uniquely random future ahead of it.</p></div>
