In the <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>second half of the chapter, we will be setting up our <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> project, which will be used for the rest of the book. Here is an overview of what to expect in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discovering <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learning why <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> is a perfect fit for our PCG project</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up our project</p></li></ul></div><p>This chapter will begin our intermediate level work in Unity. From this point onward, it is best that you have a fundamental knowledge of the Unity Editor and C# scripting. As a reminder, this project was built using the current version of Unity (5.2.2), so there will be some incompatibilities with previous versions. The files used to set up the project will be included in the accompanying files under <code class="literal">Chapter 2</code>. However, all of the code files will be covered in the chapter for those of you who prefer to write them out yourselves.</p><p>We will be working from an existing project including both art and code assets. The art files that are included have some dependencies that need to be set. There is a Unity package included, which can be imported, that will contain all the prebuilt art dependencies. All of the art files will be explained that will aid your overall understanding of the project structure. If you are comfortable with 2D sprite animations, you are welcome to use your own art.</p><p>Now, let's discuss PCG in <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games.</p></div>
