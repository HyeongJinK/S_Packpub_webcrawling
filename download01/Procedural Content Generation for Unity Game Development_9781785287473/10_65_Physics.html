In <span class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span>, a modular structure is presented but it then has physics applied to it as a means to restructure it. The effects of the physics create new structures that then impact how the game is played.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_09.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The Angry Birds' gameplay is based on physics</p></div></div><p>The trade-off is that physics requires a lot of processing power.

There are a lot of physics engines available such as the Open Dynamic Engine, so it might be more beneficial to research new ways to apply current physics systems to PCG. An idea would be to add destructible structures to your game that then leave ruins when they are destroyed.</p></div>
