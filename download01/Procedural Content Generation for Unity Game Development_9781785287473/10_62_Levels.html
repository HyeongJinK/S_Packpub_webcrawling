We can create patterns with our props to lead the player to places of interest. An example of this would be to generate the interior of a building with items we might expect to see in that building. We need to think like a level designer in this sense.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>An old time tavern or bar prop set</p></div></div><p>The challenge would be to place the props in such a way that is believable. One way would be to tag the prop with a general descriptor such as a table or a chair. Then, tag an area in a modular room where a table might show up with the table tag. Any table variant prop will now only generate on table areas.</p><p>Levels push the boundaries of PCG simply because they can be as small as a room of a house or as big as a planet. We can be very minute with our modulation if we choose. Either we can create an environment by connecting modules, or we can simply set up a space and allow modules to populate the area.</p><p>Currently, technology<a id="id427" class="indexterm"></a> has reached a point, giving us, as game developers, a choice to make. We can make contained levels within a linear or semi expansive game or we can make a universe full of procedurally generated levels. Either choice has pros and cons. Besides the requirement difference in processing power and memory, there is a question of game design. I need to be certain that the experience we wish to deliver to the player requires PCG or we will be wasting development time and resources.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Modular dungeon versus a procedurally generated world (left: Daggerfall, right: No Man's Sky)</p></div></div></div>
