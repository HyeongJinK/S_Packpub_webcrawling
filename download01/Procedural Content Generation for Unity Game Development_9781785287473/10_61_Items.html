If a character is built of armor pieces and uses weapons that are procedurally generated, then each one of those pieces has properties that can be manipulated or modularized. Just like our sword from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Generating Modular Weapons</em></span>, the item will be made of a certain amount of pieces. However, imagine if each of the pieces was then made of another set of pieces and so on.</p><p>Compounding model generation through item generation can create a truly unique experience. However, having to generate that many objects would be costly to our performance due to the amount of time and space it would require. It would also be hard on the player if every single object in the game looked different. People look for patterns.</p><p>One option would be to generate an item and then store a reference to that model for later use. By reusing some things, we give the player some patterns to work with. An example of this would be to generate all swords that do fire damage to be rendered with a red glow.</p><p>We still need to<a id="id425" class="indexterm"></a> consider things like overloading our system, machine, or even the player. We need to strike a balance when it comes to model generation. You can potentially create a system that can generate trillions of unique objects, but without the proper processing power and memory management, it might not be a practical solution. It could be too overwhelming for the player to have that many options.</p><p>Item generation is another form of model generation or sprite generation. For further study, you will need a foundation in 2D and 3D space mathematics. However, items usually impact how the player interacts with their environment. So in addition to programming and mathematics, it would be beneficial to spend some time studying game design and user experience. Being able to fully conceptualize the balance that needs to be applied to item generation makes you a well-rounded developer.</p></div>
