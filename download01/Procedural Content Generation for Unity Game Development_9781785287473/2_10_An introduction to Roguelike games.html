Its name originates from a game called<a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="emphasis"><em>Rogue</em></span> released in 1980 by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman. Rogue is known for its use of PCG, particularly in level creation. The game used a tile-based level generation system, in particular ASCII characters were used to represent tiles.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/4808_02_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image of <span class="emphasis"><em>Rogue</em></span> (1980) by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman</p></div></div><p>A tile is a small <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>piece of art, typically depicting land or ground that can be laid out like a game board. Imagine a Chess or Checkers board, but each square can be replaced with a small rectangular picture. In tile-based games, it is typical that the player character only occupies a single tile space at a time. Our <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game will use a tile-based level generator, as well.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/4808_02_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Tile sprite sheet from the popular game, <span class="emphasis"><em>Pokemon</em></span>, developed by Game Freak</p></div></div><p>Other typical traits <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>and gameplay mechanics of <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games include 2D graphics, random player items, turn-based gameplay, and permanent player character death. Games that mimic the 1980's <span class="emphasis"><em>Rogue</em></span> have been popular among the indie game market. <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games' use of PCG makes them ideal for easier art asset production and potentially cheaper to develop.</p></div>
