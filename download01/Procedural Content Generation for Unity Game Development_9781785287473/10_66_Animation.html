Have you ever played a game where an NPC turned to look in your direction? This is a procedurally generated animation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_11.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Mr. I in Mario 64, changing the direction it looks in toward Mario</p></div></div><p>These types of <a id="id435" class="indexterm"></a>animations are more intuitively created procedurally. A similar example is an NPC moving towards you as you fled. The NPC would have to procedurally generate the path and animate its position through it. This is only a partial animation, though, as we would still have to animate the walk or run animation as well. The walk/run animation would be much harder to generate procedurally so we usually use key frame animation here.</p><p>Animation is something that has been studied in the academic realm for a while. Animating physical reactions is a big part of this study, but natural movement comes up a lot too. We use key frame animation for things like movement because we need the animations to look believable or it breaks immersion. However, it might be the case that procedurally generated animations are preferred eventually.</p><p>An example of procedurally generating an animation that relied on believability might be if you were to take a randomly generated creature that we knew would walk on some number of feet, we generated the movement animation. We would place an alternating back and forth motion on the feet and an alternating swing or sway on the body. Perhaps even add alternating animations on any other limbs as well.</p><p>Animation is another field that can be studied all on its own. If you were looking for ways to generate animation with PCG, it would be worth your time to study key frame animation. Usually, when generating animations, there is a certain amount of physics involved as well. If you imagine walking, it is a very physics-intensive action where your body is constantly fighting<a id="id436" class="indexterm"></a> against gravity.</p></div>
