With the addition of our PCG dungeon generator, we are ready to do some dungeon crawling. There was quite a bit that we went over in this chapter, so let's summarize what we covered.</p><p>You designed a PCG dungeon generator that doesn't rely on player input like the world board. You learned how to effectively utilize a queue to process our Dungeon Board data. You developed a dungeon generator capable of utilizing both random paths and larger level asset placement. Finally, you got to see firsthand how to recreate a previously generated dungeon by seeding the PRN generator.</p><p>This concludes our level generation portion of the game. You have all you need to expand and adapt the code for a truly expansive and uniquely interesting game world. Take some time to experiment with the world board and Dungeon Board to see what you come up with. Now, our player needs some items and weapons to prepare himself for the coming enemies.</p><p>We are going to look at placing items in our world. Of course, these items will be random in nature, but they will play a role in how difficult the game becomes later on. We have a lot going on in our game world as well, so we need to be a little more precise in how we deliver items to the player; all of this and more in the next chapter.</p></div>
