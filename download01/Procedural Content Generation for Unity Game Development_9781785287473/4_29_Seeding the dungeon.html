There is a simple way to test this as well. In the <code class="literal">DungeonManager.cs</code> file, add the line <code class="literal">Random.seed = 1;</code> to the top of the definition of the <code class="literal">StartDungeon</code> function.</p><p>Now return to the Unity Editor and play the game. Enter a dungeon and take a screenshot of the overview. Then, end the game and play again. Enter a dungeon and compare its overview to that of the screenshot. You will see that they have the exact same shape.</p><p>This is how we can destroy an entire randomly generated dungeon, yet return to it at a later time. You can adapt this line of code for situations such as having a player return to a dungeon to complete a task. For now, you can comment this line out because we won't be using it for our game, but feel free to experiment.</p></div>
