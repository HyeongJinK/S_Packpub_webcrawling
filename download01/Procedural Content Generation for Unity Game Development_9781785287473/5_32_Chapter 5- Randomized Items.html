We can use PCG to help us vary our content so that we don't have to create an overly large library of art assets. It is common in games that have a lot of content to use the same 3D model or sprite for two different items and just change the color or texture.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to add items that our player can use to give them an advantage in the game. We will be adding both health items and items that can be stored in the player's inventory that will give the player bonus effects, such as damage and defense. We will randomize the values and use different colors to represent the strength of the item. This way, we can use the same sprite to represent several different item types. Here is a quick overview of what you will learn in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing a method to deliver items to the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing a method to randomly place items within the world and Dungeon Boards</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using guided PRNs to determine the item's strength</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learning to manipulate the color of a sprite so that it can be reused as several different items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a simple inventory</p></li></ul></div><p>Content like items do need some sort of basis. This is usually a 3D model without a texture or a sprite drawn in gray-scale. We can then add the texture or color programmatically. It is possible to create sprites and 3D models programmatically as well, but this is very difficult if the model or sprite is complex or needs to be animated. Also, the 3D model or sprite might never quite match your game theme in the way a human designed art asset could.</p><p>With this caveat in mind, we will be doing a little art asset creation in this chapter. Another sprite sheet will be provided in the exercise files in the <code class="literal">Chapter 5</code> folder. However, feel free to create your own art base for color manipulation. We will go over the import method needed to get our new art assets in our game.</p></div>
