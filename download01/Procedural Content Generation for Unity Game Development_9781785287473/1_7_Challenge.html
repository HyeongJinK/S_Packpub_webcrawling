Try on your own to have the script display a random number from 1-6. You can, instead of displaying text, display an image of a die face. Also, see if you can display the image and store the random number corresponding to the die face for reference.</p><p>You can also try changing the seed to a number of your choice. If you play the scene with a constant number, you will get the same result every time. Try different numbers for different results. This is the benefit of the seed value; even though we are introducing a bit of randomness to our game, we have a way to control it. We will explore the seed value further in a later chapter.</p></div>
