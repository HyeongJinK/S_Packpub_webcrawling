You received an intro to PRNs and PCG by making a quick <code class="literal">Hello World</code> program. However, it is time to develop a fully functional PCG algorithm that can be directly applied to our <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game.</p><p>Our game has the base functionality of a player character capable of movement by player input. In this chapter, we will create the tile-based Game Board that the player will explore. This Game Board will expand itself as the player moves, and as there are no bounds, the board is potentially infinite. In this chapter, you can expect:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To learn about dynamic data structures</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To design our first PCG algorithm</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To set up a scene that allows for an ever expanding game world</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To develop our PCG Game Board</p></li></ul></div><p>By the end of the chapter, you will have developed a PCG game world that is unique with every play. Plus, you will have achieved this with a relatively small amount of assets. We have to do some learning and planning first. So let's get started on the endless PCG Game Board.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808-03-01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>This is what our Roguelike endless PCG Game Board will look like</p></div></div></div>
