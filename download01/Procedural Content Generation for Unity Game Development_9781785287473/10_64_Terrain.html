With either, we can use a fractal or noise patterns as a basis. We can create a height map that can be wrapped around objects. An alternative for our planet in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Generating a 3D Planet</em></span>, would have been to<a id="id430" class="indexterm"></a> use a Perlin noise distortion height map.</p><p>A height map is a texture<a id="id431" class="indexterm"></a> that has 3D qualities. You would then apply the height map texture to the 3D model to give the model a 3D texture. As you can see in the following figure, this is an easy way to create a terrain.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_10_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Noise image used to create height map</p></div></div><p>Besides the actual texture of the ground, tons of work has gone into making tree and foliage generators. Terrain is one of the better defined constructs in PCG. This is a good starting point for anyone learning 3D PCG.</p></div>
