However, it is unrealistic to think that we won't need any art assets at all. We can still use our art intelligently, and with the aid of PCG, a little art can go a long way.</p><p>In this chapter, we see how we can create small pieces of art that are combined in different ways to generate bigger and randomly unique assets. We will be creating a modular weapon system. Each piece of art is a module that will attach to another module to create a whole weapon. We can then let the pieces combine randomly to give us surprisingly unique assets.</p><p>Here is what you will learn in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understanding modular art assets</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learning about the statistics behind modular generation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Procedurally generating game objects that are composed from smaller pieces</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Animating via a script</p></li></ul></div><p>The weapons that will be generated from this modular weapon system will be used by our player character. Since we are generating an entirely unique asset from some existing assets, we will forfeit our use of sprite animation, which is derived from a sprite sheet. It isn't very interesting to just see the image of the weapon, though. We will also have to script some animation for the character in order for it to swing the weapon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_06_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The final result of the modular weapon implementation</p></div></div><p>Once our weapon generation system is implemented, we will be able to easily add to it. The weapons will allow our player to attack and defend themselves. We are approaching the end of the development of our game, so let's jump in and keep the momentum going.</p></div>
