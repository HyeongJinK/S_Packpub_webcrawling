You went over an introduction to PCG and why and how to use it. You were also introduced to PRNs and to how they are generated. We discussed what makes PRNs different from your average random number and the benefit a seed provides. You also learned why and how to use PRNs and then completed an example expanding on the classic <code class="literal">Hello World</code> program.</p><p>So what's left? Well, we are gearing up to build a fully functional game throughout this book. We are going to look at some of the more popular applications of PCG in video games. In the next chapter, we are going to briefly get acquainted with <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games, which is a popular game subgenre. Roguelike games are known for their procedurally generated content, so it is a perfect fit for our learning adventure.</p></div>
