This project will use a predefined art asset group and code base. We will be getting these assets from the Unity Technologies tutorial <span class="emphasis"><em>2D Roguelike</em></span>. This tutorial was actually the inspiration for this book, so it's only fitting that we showcase some of it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/4808_02_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Unity Technologies' 2D Roguelikeâ€”courtesy of Unity Technologies</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>The full Unity 2D <a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>Roguelike tutorial can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial</a>.</p><p>All the assets used<a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a> in the tutorial are available via the Unity Asset Store at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/29825" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/29825</a>.</p></div><p>Even though we are using the assets from Unity's 2D <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span>, this won't be a recreation of the tutorial. We <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>want to explore more of what PCG has to offer, so we will only be using a portion of Unity's original tutorial. Also, having the art assets predefined in this way will be helpful in allowing us to dive right into the PCG development.</p></div>
