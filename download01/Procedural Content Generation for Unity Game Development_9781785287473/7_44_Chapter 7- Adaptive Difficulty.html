So far, our character has been wandering around an empty world collecting food and items. But that is all about to change because in this chapter, we are going to add brain hungry zombies that scale in difficulty and test the player's strength.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_07_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Player among enemies!</p></div></div><p>Adaptive difficulty<a id="id274" class="indexterm"></a> can be solely a PCG solution or it can, in part, rely on an <span class="strong"><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>) solution. Our <a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a>main goal with PCG is to expand the playtime and game content. Normally, when we think of PCG, we think of content such as art assets being programmatically created or new game objects being added to the game at runtime. We can also think of PCG as a <a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a>means to expand the game's complexity internally as well.</p><p>We will be adding enemies to both the world board and Dungeon Board. At first, the enemies won't be very dangerous as they are slow and not good at navigating obstacles. However, as the player gains weapons and items and becomes more dangerous, the enemies will get smarter, faster, and more numerous.</p><p>In this chapter, you <a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a>will be learning how to use the idea of PCG to change the gameplay and make it more challenging. You will develop some simple AI and path-finding routines. Then, lastly, you will adjust the AI during gameplay to keep the player challenged. We will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding enemies to the world board</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding enemies to the Dungeon Board</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Fighting the enemy</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adaptive difficulty</p></li></ul></div><p>So, we will be generating enemies for the player to battle against, but we will also be generating the enemy's behavior. The goal is to increase the challenge the player faces as the player gets stronger. Making the enemies stronger as well does really change how the game is played, but making the enemies smarter will shift game play and challenge the player mentally, which should make for a more entertaining game.</p><p>The distinction between AI and PCG is, PCG is used to manipulate or generate content and AI is a programmed behavior set. We then use PCG to manipulate the AI as if it were content. In the example later in the chapter, you will see that we add new AI behaviors as our player progresses.</p></div>
