You have also had the chance to experience PCG, first hand, by designing and implementing PCG algorithms. You built the core game play of a 2D <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game that can generate content forever. You also implemented a 3D planet generator that not only looked good from afar, but we were also able to explore it in first person.</p><p>PCG doesn't end there though. There are still a lot of topics that we didn't cover such as generating textures and story lines or allowing the player to generate content. There is a lot that can be done and has yet to be done in the world of PCG for games.</p><p>In this chapter, we will go over the main categories of game content and discuss how these, sometimes very different, areas can be procedurally generated. This chapter will give you a basic idea of how to approach your further PCG learning. It's likely that following is a category of content that you didn't even think about procedurally generating. And, hopefully, this chapter will help inspire you to try new PCG techniques in game development.</p><p>Here are the categories that we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Models</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Levels</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Textures</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Terrain</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Physics</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Animations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>AI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Story</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Player sandbox</p></li></ul></div><p>PCG has been around since the beginning of game development. This is because video games were created by <a id="id420" class="indexterm"></a>programmers. Everything had to be procedurally generated in the very beginning. In the early days of computing, the same modern resources were not available. Early computers lacked the memory to store game models for characters and levels, and performance was too limited to display complex graphics. PCG has been around since the beginning, but it has a brighter future now than ever before due to our advances in technology.</p></div>
