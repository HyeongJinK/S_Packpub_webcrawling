Doing this will allow us to focus less on developing common gaming mechanics and more on PCG development. We also took a look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games and how they uses PCG in tile based level generation.</p><p>During this chapter, you learned about the RPG subgenre <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span>, which is an ode to the 1980's game, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rogue</em></span>. We talked about the <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game's inherent use of PCG, which is the reason we are developing one. And we set up our base project from which we will be developing our game. Now, we are ready to start learning how to build some PCG logic.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will put what you've learned about <code class="literal">Random</code> numbers and <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> games to work. We will be using our floor and wall tiles to build an endless game world.</p></div>
