Remember that for our weapon prefab, all you need to do is add another set of three modules (blade, hilt, and handle) to drastically increase the number of combinations that the Weapon prefab can take. We did more than just create a useless modular weapon, though; we actually implemented its full functionality. This gave us some insight on a few different development techniques, such as scripted animation.</p><p>In this chapter, you learned about what a modular weapon is and the concept of breaking a structure down to small reusable parts. You learned that a few additional modules can create exponentially more combinations. We also developed one technique in procedurally generating and combining sprites to make a whole GameObject. Lastly, you developed a system to animate the weapon action via a script alone.</p><p>There are some optimizations that can be made with this system that I will leave up to you. Remember, every GameObject we add to the screen will slow down the entire game and is very hard to enable on mobile platforms. I recommend that you look into how you might combine modules into one sprite, and then add a single GameObject instead of four per weapon.</p><p>Next, we are going to put those weapons and items to use as we introduce enemies with adaptive difficulty. We can procedurally change and adapt our AI and enemy strength to the player as they get stronger in the game.</p></div>
