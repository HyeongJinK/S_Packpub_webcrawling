In the previous chapter, we produced a game board that expanded as the player explored the game. We are going to continue with the game board idea with a new type of board, the Dungeon Board. We will thus refer to our initial game board as the world board. The world board will be persistent and lead the player to instances of <a id="id133" class="indexterm"></a>Dungeon Boards. Though we could add many different game mechanics to the world board alone, we want to learn more of what PCG has to offer. In this chapter, we want to explore another type of PCG level creation. We are going to make a random dungeon generator.</p><p>Our world board is a type of player-driven PCG. The world board reveals the pieces of board that the player dictates. Our dungeon generator will be system driven. We will develop an algorithm to completely create a whole dungeon. Using PRNs, we will allow randomness to dictate the shape and size of our dungeon.</p><p>By not controlling too much of our dungeon generator, we should get some surprisingly unique and interesting dungeon designs. However, we will have to provide some guidelines. Random events can add fun and spontaneity, but that same spontaneity can be unwieldy and either overwhelm the player or cause problems within the system such as building paths off the defined area bounds.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785287473/graphics/B04808_04_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Image of final result of dungeon generator</p></div></div><p>Here's what you can expect from this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learn a system-driven PCG algorithm</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Explore the uses of queues</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Manipulate PRNs to create random events</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Develop a random dungeon generator</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Return to the idea of seeding PRNs to recreate patterns</p></li></ul></div><p>Now, let's jump into how to develop a dungeon generator.</p></div>
