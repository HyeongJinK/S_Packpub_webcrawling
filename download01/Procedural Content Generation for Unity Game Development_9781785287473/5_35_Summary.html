We figured out a good way to randomly place Items by implementing some health Items. Then, we expanded on that by spawning Chests that contain random armor Items. We only used two sprites for our armor Items but turned them into essentially eight different items.</p><p>You learned how to take some elements in our game environment and use them to our advantage, such as the wall tile yielding food items. You learned how to take a more subtle approach to randomly spawning assets into the game. We used highly guided PRNs to determine types of Items. You learned how to use something such as color to change the look of an item enough to make it a new item. And finally, we created a simple inventory base that can be expanded upon.</p><p>We are going to continue with the item theme in the next chapter. We have health items to heal us from enemy attacks and we have armor items to protect us from bad guys. All we need now is weapons to do some damage. The next chapter will introduce random modular weapons.</p></div>
