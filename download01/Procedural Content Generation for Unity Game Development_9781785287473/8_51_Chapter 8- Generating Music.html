There is still plenty <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>of polishing we can do to the game, such as adding stories or quests, other game sounds, and opening/closing screens. However, the extras can be left to you to finish with your newly acquired knowledge of PCG.</p><p>Music is one of the more theoretical subjects we can attempt to procedurally generate. We need general knowledge of how to procedurally generate content and we also need knowledge of music theory so that we can construct a coherent melody. Don't worry, though; we will go through the steps that will give us the information that we need to tackle this task. Here's what you will learn in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Simple music theory</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create an algorithm from a new theory</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Modularizing code when working with a new subject</p></li></ul></div><p>Those of you who have a background in music might already have the knowledge needed to complete this chapter. However, for those who do not, we will be covering a basic theory of music. We will only be covering enough music theory to complete the chapter, so feel free to do your own research and go more in depth. Now, let's get started with our final <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game chapter!</p></div>
