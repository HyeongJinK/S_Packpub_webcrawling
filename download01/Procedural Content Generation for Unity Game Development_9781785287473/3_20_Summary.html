You completed your first PCG feature from design to development. However, there is still plenty left to do.</p><p>In this chapter, you learned about and analyzed a few different data structures. You designed an algorithm that will expand the Game Board as the player explores. You set up the scene so we could implement our PCG algorithm by adding layers and a player tracking camera feature. And finally, you implemented our algorithm design and created a procedurally generated game world.</p><p>There's still more game world to procedurally generate. In the next chapter, we are going to develop a different kind of level building. We will be creating a random dungeon generator. This will present a new set of PCG algorithm challenges.</p></div>
