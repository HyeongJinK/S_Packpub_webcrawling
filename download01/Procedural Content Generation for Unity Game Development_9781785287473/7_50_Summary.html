In this chapter, we added the component of enemy opposition and made the difficulty scale with the player.</p><p>In this chapter, you added enemies to the game that inherited the same base class as the <code class="literal">Player</code> class. In PCG fashion, you spawned the enemies at random and had to handle destroying the enemies at the appropriate times. You set up monitoring of the player to scale the difficulty. Instead of just upping the hit points or strength of the enemies to scale the difficulty, you made them faster and smarter by developing a more efficient AI.</p><p>We did quite a bit in this chapter, but there is a lot more that we can still do to improve the system. You should continue experimenting with adaptive difficulty. See how much you can improve the AI to make smart enemies with better pathfinding and possibly wall breaking like the player. You can also use randomness to determine how smart an enemy is. Then, you can differentiate between the types of enemies by changing the sprite or the color. Also, don't forget that the player has a <code class="literal">Defense</code> modifier that can be utilized.</p><p>The gameplay of our game is relatively complete. It is time to give it some personality with sound. We are going to step into the more conceptual realms of PCG by making music based on randomness and the player's actions. The next chapter will be the completion of our 2D <span class="emphasis"><em>Roguelike</em></span> game.</p></div>
