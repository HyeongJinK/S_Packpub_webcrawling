There is a lot more to do and explore here but most of it requires a strong foundation in graphics programming and mathematics. Try experimenting with the techniques that you have learned in this book to generate 3D objects and possibly randomizing them in some way.</p><p>A good start to your self-learning would be to procedurally change the colors of your planet. See if you can write a script that will randomize the colors on the materials of the planet as we did in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Randomized Items</em></span>. You can also refine the land creation process and make modular continents as well.</p><p>In this chapter, we discussed the changes from 2D versus 3D rendering. You learned about the importance of space and time complexity. You learned that there is usually more than one way to make a 3D object. Lastly, you learned that PCG with 3D requires quite a bit of highly specific mathematics.</p><p>You learned all about PCG both in 2D and 3D. We have completed all of the programming that this book has to offer. The next chapter isn't so much about coding PCG as it is discussing the future of PCG and where it plans to take us.</p></div>
