The default Ouya icon is at (your game project folder)<code class="literal">\Assets\Plugins\Android\res\drawable-xhdpi\ouya_icon.png</code> and it's a 732 x 412 pixels PNG file. Replace it with the icon of your choice and then go to the build settings by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settingsâ€¦</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> and type a name for the file in the text field, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><p>Now that's saved we need to go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>My Games</strong></span> page on the Ouya website and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span>. Add some screenshots; they need to be 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high and you need a minimum of three; can submit up to nine. Scroll down to the bottom and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Upload APK</strong></span>, then follow the on-screen instructions, once the upload is complete click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. This will take you back to the <span class="strong"><strong>My Games</strong></span> page where you'll most likely see that Ouya are still verifying your APK. Give it a few minutes and then refresh the page, the warnings should have disappeared.</p><p>Finally, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit for review</strong></span>. The status should change to <span class="strong"><strong>Submitted</strong></span> and you're done! The review process normally takes a few days but that can go up or down depending how busy they are.</p></div>
