The large publishers have invaded the app stores and are doing what<a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a> they do best, making money by releasing already established IP and buying anyone who does well, but the smaller teams are competing<a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a> and in some cases outdoing the larger companies. <span class="strong"><strong>Minecraft</strong></span>, a game initially created by one man, has pulled in over $80,000,000, and <span class="strong"><strong>Angry Birds</strong></span>, created <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>by Rovio with a team of twelve developers, has made over $100,000,000.</p><p>If you are lucky enough to create a successful app you'll earn very good money, but the pool to be selected from has grown massively since 2008. There are now an estimated 900,000 apps on the app store for iOS alone with a similar amount for Android.</p></div>
