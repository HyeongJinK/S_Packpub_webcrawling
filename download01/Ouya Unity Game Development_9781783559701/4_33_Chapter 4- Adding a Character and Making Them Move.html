We're going to add movement to our basic character and get the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> game object in Unity following them around the level as they move. We'll also add in the ability for them to push crates around the level. Finally, we'll swap out our existing character for something that is a bit fancier and trigger their built in animations as they move around the level.</p></div>
