With its support for four controllers and output to the TV, it was to try and capture the glory days of console gaming; you and your friends sitting on a sofa together, having fun playing games. It used a crowd-funding <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>website named <span class="strong"><strong>Kickstarter</strong></span> to announce itself and generate funds. The <span class="strong"><strong>Ouya</strong></span> development<a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a> team was asking for $950,000. Backers would receive access to the device when it was released. The Kickstarter fund-raising goal was raised within 8 hours. Ouya holds the record for the best first day performance of any project on Kickstarter to date. Ouya became the most quickly funded project on Kickstarter to reach one million dollars, and went on to become the eighth project in Kickstarter history to raise more than a million dollars. At the end of the funding, the development team had received $8,596,474. The cost of the device was $99 and it ran Android. This meant there was a large library of games available to easily port across to Ouya. Developers heavily backed the Ouya as the consistent hardware specification is a boon to Android developers who normally have to contend <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>with device specification fragmentation.</p></div>
