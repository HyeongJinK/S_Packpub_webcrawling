Organization of your code and project is paramount; otherwise things will get very messy very quickly. Why don't you try making this game work on some other platforms? The best way to learn is through experimenting and performing, so what are you waiting for? If you do get stuck, the forums at <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.unity3d.com" target="_blank">http://forum.unity3d.com</a> are really helpful. Hopefully you feel comfortable with the basics of programming on Unity for Ouya now and I look forward to see all the cool new things you come up with. This demo alone could be expanded to have hundreds of levels, more sounds, and some better graphical effects.</p><p>My Twitter username is <code class="literal">@Gary_BBGames</code> and I'm happy to answer any questions or help out in any way possible if you get stuck.
