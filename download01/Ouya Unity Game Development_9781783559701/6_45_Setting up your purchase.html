Log in to the <span class="strong"><strong>Ouya Developer Portal</strong></span> at <a class="ulink" href="https://devs.ouya.tv/developers" target="_blank">https://devs.ouya.tv/developers</a> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Products</strong></span> option <a id="id254" class="indexterm"></a>from the top menu. It will take you to a <a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a>screen where you need to complete the following fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Identifier</strong></span>: Call it <code class="literal">SokobanUnlock</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span>: This is the name that the player will see. Call it <code class="literal">Sokoban â€“ Full Unlock</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Price</strong></span>: It can be difficult choosing the price for your game. It's better to start a little higher, that way you can always offer sales at a later date. Set it to <code class="literal">1.99</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span>: This is going to be a one off purchase so set it to <span class="strong"><strong>Entitlement</strong></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you've entered all that information, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create Product</strong></span> and you'll be taken back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Products</strong></span> screen.</p><p>The Ouya store <a id="id256" class="indexterm"></a>will pay you when your game earns over $150, and the payments will come 30 days after the month in which the money was earned. The Ouya store takes 30% of the sale price, which is standard for the industry now.</p></div>
