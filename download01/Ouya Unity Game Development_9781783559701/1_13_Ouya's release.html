Events are unfolding very similar to the iPhone release and developers want to get in to the Ouya development while it's still fresh and new.</p><p>While it runs Android, it's a complete visual change. Special consideration needs to be taken to implement the controller support and in-app purchase. All games on the Ouya need to offer a demo version or be free.
