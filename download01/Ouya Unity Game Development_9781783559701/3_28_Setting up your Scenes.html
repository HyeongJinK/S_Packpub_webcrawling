<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec32"></a>Setting up your Scenes</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>You should <a id="id119" class="indexterm"></a>now have a project panel with seven folders and a scene with <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>OuyaGameObject</strong></span> that you have entered your developer ID into. We <a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a>are going to use this scene as a setup scene that isn't displayed for long but instead adds all the required game objects. Normally in Unity, when loading a new scene, all objects are destroyed, and then the objects in the new scene are loaded. If it is needed to have an object persist between scenes then there is a method, <code class="literal">DontDestroyOnLoad</code> that you can pass an object to. If the object is a component or GameObject then its entire transform hierarchy will not be destroyed either. A side effect of this is that if the scene has the GameObject added to it in Unity and you load it multiple times (on a level select screen for example) then the GameObject will be<a id="id121" class="indexterm"></a> cloned multiple times and, with a GameObject that handles controller input for example, this can result in multiple controller presses being <a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a>triggered. We can avoid this by having all our GameObjects that require <code class="literal">DontDestroyOnLoad</code> being instantiated on a scene that we will only ever load the one time.</p><p>As we won't be displaying anything on this scene, you should delete <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>. We'll also need a mechanism to leave this scene and load the next one, by performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Save the current scene as <code class="literal">SetUp</code> by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Scene</strong></span>, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span> folder you created earlier.</p></li><li><p>While we're dealing with scenes, let's create another one we're going to be using shortly. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Scene</strong></span>, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span> folder you created earlier. Give it a name of <code class="literal">TitleScreen</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Repeat these steps to create a scene named <span class="strong"><strong>GameScreen</strong></span> too. This will have left us in the wrong scene, so double-click on our <span class="strong"><strong>SetUp</strong></span> scene again to load that one.</p></li><li><p>Your final setup should look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783559701/graphics/9701OS_03_02.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div>
