We've gone from some colored cubes to something that is actually playable as a game on Ouya. We've now also got camera animation and character animation. As a developer, most of the time you'll work with an artist or buy your assets, so they will come with pre-built animations in them already, the method employed here to animate your character will likely be the most common set of circumstances. Next up we're going to add some finishing touches to our game.</p></div>
