If you're patient enough, you have even worked out how to finish the level, but don't worry if not, we'll explain the solution shortly. In this chapter, we'll be adding some polish to our game, texturing the cubes, so they fit in more with the design of the main character you added in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding a Character and Making Them Move</em></span>. We'll also be adding a new level or two, and also indicate when the player has finished the level by playing a fanfare sound.</p></div>
