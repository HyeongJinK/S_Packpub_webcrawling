Splines are curves defined by a set of control points.</p><p>Generally, these objects are difficult to export to other game engines. <a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a>The COLLADA file <a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a>exporter can save roads as 3D models, saving the triangulated mesh as model sections. The GROME plugin SDK exposes all necessary functions to get at them. Because we can't easily export spline objects as roads or models to other game engines, all we can do is quickly cover how to use them in GROME but we won't be using them later except as a guide for painting.</p><p>To find the Road tool we need to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span> tab on the toolbar panel. Currently there's only one set of tools (<span class="strong"><strong>Roads</strong></span>), the options are shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_09.jpg" /></div><p>World Editor projects are self-contained and can be used without a terrain surface. But when working with terrain surfaces GROME provides special layers for <a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a>linking roads to the ground.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec42"></a>Create tool</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we can create a road there's one important thing we must do; select the <span class="strong"><strong>New Shape</strong></span> option in the tool box so a new road network object is started.</p><p>The tool panel rollup presents two methods of creating roads: <a id="id338" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Points</strong></span> or <a id="id339" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Freeform</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>Points</strong></span> is a simple, click a point on the ground to add a new road spline, control point, when you have two or more points GROME will connect them. Keep clicking to add more points.</p><p>The second method <span class="strong"><strong>Freeform</strong></span> is handy if you change the View mode to "top down" (by pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> key) and then use the mouse to trace an approximate path around the terrain. GROME will smooth out our inputs and connect them as best as it can.</p><p>Let's create a road from the base of our river to the top of the peninsular.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_10.jpg" /></div><p>Once we've completed this we might find the generated road surface sticking through the terrain at various points. This is where we use the special and incredibly cool "glue" layer. I say cool because when I first discovered this feature I spent hours recreating tracks from the classic Amiga game â€“ Stunt Car Racer. But, more of this later.</p><p>In the layer stack, if we now right-click our road layer and select <span class="strong"><strong>Assign to selection</strong></span> we should see our newly created <a id="id340" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Road Entity</strong></span>. By default all roads are named the same. Get into the habit of giving them unique names so when it comes time to assigning the layer we have some idea which one we're selecting.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_11.jpg" /></div><p>As soon as we click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, GROME will form-fit any terrain under the road, and this is where we can have some fun. Now the road entity has been "glued" to the road layer, we can adjust the control points to fine tune the path.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec37"></a>Adding more roads to create a network</h4></div></div></div><p>To add roads coming off an existing road we set the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>. Then click on the original road so that it's selected, continue drawing points in <a id="id341" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id342" class="indexterm"></a>Freeform or by adding single points. Each new section of road will need to have its texture properties set so don't worry about new sections appearing in the default flat grey color. </p><p>If the new sections of road are not connected we can use the Weld tool to join them. One issue you might come across is that of gaps appearing in the road surface when adding new sections. This seems to be an artifact of how the engine is updated. Saving and re-loading the project will force a complete update which will fill in any apparent gaps.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec43"></a>Adjust tool</h3></div></div></div><p>This tool allows us to freely move points of the road around the map. There are two methods of movement (see <span class="strong"><strong>Move method</strong></span> at the <a id="id343" class="indexterm"></a>bottom of this tool).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_12.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Surface</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span> are the two methods, <a id="id344" class="indexterm"></a>described as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Surface</strong></span> will keep the point aligned to the surface of the terrain</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span> gives us a 3D transformation gizmo <a id="id345" class="indexterm"></a>which lets us pull the terrain up into the air or sink it into the ground</p></li></ul></div><p>In the following screenshot, you can see a road point being dragged out to sea and GROME builds a "viaduct" to keep the terrain surface in contact.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_13.jpg" /></div><p>We can do more with this feature by applying a bevel to the road which will smooth out embankments and cuttings.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec44"></a>Configure tool</h3></div></div></div><p>This tool allows us to choose road surface textures and adjust the width of the <a id="id346" class="indexterm"></a>road entity. The level of control we have over a section of road depends on the active <span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span> mode shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_14.jpg" /></div><p>From left to right the modes are: <span class="strong"><strong>Points</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Edges</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Sections</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span>.</p><p>For our simple example we'll use the Network <a id="id347" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span> mode and click near the middle of the road (it should turn red). The road gizmo will be crossed at intervals by handles we can grab with the mouse.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_15.jpg" /></div><p>Click and drag one out to the side, the embankment will stretch and smoothen out as you increase its distance from the center. If we click and drag the perpendicular line, we adjust the width of the road.</p><p>This is known as the "Influence"<a id="id348" class="indexterm"></a>, this is the amount of blending <a id="id349" class="indexterm"></a>between the road layer and the terrain layer.</p><p>If we select the Point mode (the first <a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span> mode button) we can select individual points and make fine adjustments for the influence and add "bank" to the road surface by dragging the circular gizmo that appears in the image as shown in the next screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_16.jpg" /></div><p>We can individually drag the influence control points which give this tool enormous flexibility for creating spline-based riverbeds. (Remember; the exported heightmap will retain the height information but not the road detail.)</p><p>One final parameter we haven't covered but should mention; <span class="strong"><strong>Step size</strong></span> determines the resolution of the road. The larger the step size, the fewer polygons are used to construct the road geometry. When exporting the map in COLLADA format, the <a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a>detail of the road geometry is based on this value.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec38"></a>Texturing the road</h4></div></div></div><p>To apply a texture to the entire road network we should select the Network mode. The tool panel section called <span class="strong"><strong>Road Texturing</strong></span> has three boxes for selecting <a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a>textures (<span class="strong"><strong>Cross Out</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Road</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Cross In</strong></span>). With the road network highlighted, click on the middle <span class="strong"><strong>Road</strong></span> image box ("<span class="strong"><strong>Channel source</strong></span>: Road" ) which will force the package browser window to appear. A number of road textures are provided and filled in <code class="literal">textures/roads</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_17.jpg" /></div><p>We can apply different textures to different parts of the road.
