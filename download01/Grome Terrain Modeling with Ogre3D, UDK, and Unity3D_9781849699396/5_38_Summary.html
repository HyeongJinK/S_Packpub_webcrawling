We went through each tool available to Detail layers; brushes, importing, and procedural mapping using distribution masks. Finally, we had a quick look at blending and the issue of baking shadows from trees onto terrain using object layers. </p><p>In the next chapter, we look at adding water features such as rivers, water planes, and a look at road building.</p></div>
