<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"></a>Zones</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Zones are containers for terrains, objects, masks, <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>and roads, but importantly they define size and terrain resolution. Each one can have its own properties. This allows us to create landscapes with variable amounts of detail according to the needs of a game. You can create zones <span class="emphasis"><em>anywhere</em></span> in the scene; they don't need to be contiguous. Creating very long narrow terrains that follow the length of a river are possible; an "on-rails" game that follows a long winding path does not have a huge regular terrain grid. However, for simple exporting to game engines it is best if we stick to a square arrangement, as game editors don't natively support asymmetric layouts.</p><p>The Zone toolbox tab is <a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a>shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_09.jpg" /></div><p>We can create zones in several ways; the easiest is entering size parameters and using the mouse to define an area called the <a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Active Creation Grid</strong></span> in the scene.</p><p>Click on the <a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Zone</strong></span> button to activate the creation process. You'll see the scene divided by a grid (the scale depends on the value of the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> parameter when the Zone tool is activated). The parameters in the Terrain Zone panel are important for all the zone creation methods so we'll go over what they mean:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span>: The width and height in world <a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a>units of the zone when you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tiles no</strong></span>: The number of tiles (across and down) that will be generated for the zone. A tile is the smallest editable unit in <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a>GROME. The number of vertices across the terrain mesh will be this value plus one.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tile size</strong></span>: This is an alternative way of <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>specifying the resolution of the grid. When you update this value, the number of tiles is automatically updated to be <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>Tile size</strong></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>To illustrate the relationship between Size, Tile no, and Tile size, refer to following figure which shows three zones created with different parameters. </p><p>Most projects will require higher resolution unless you are creating tiles for a flight-simulator where areas of ground detail are mostly flat with satellite images layered on top. Publicly available satellite topography often has a very low resolution, about 30 meters to 200 meters between data points. The following image shows three zones created with different parameters:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_10.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"></a>Know the dimensions</h3></div></div></div><p>If you know the dimensions of the region you need to <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>create, you can enter the corner coordinates in the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Area</strong></span> <a id="id71" class="indexterm"></a>panel (1 world unit = 1 meter). A 5 km area centered on the world origin can be created with the following values:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_11.jpg" /></div><p>After you have entered the coordinates, clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Select on grid</strong></span> button will mark the area in the viewport. To complete the action click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>. GROME will generate the appropriate number of zones to cover the area you specified (width divided by size). If the total width is 5,000 units and the size is set to 500 then 100 zones will be created (10 rows and 10 columns). Each zone will contain the number of tiles <a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a>specified so ensure the Tile no. is set to <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>something reasonable or you might have memory problems.</p><p>Creating zones this way is ideal for game engines as you typically know how big the area you need is in advance.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"></a>Zone splitter</h3></div></div></div><p>This handy function allows <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>us to split selected zones into a specified number of smaller ones. <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Split factor</strong></span> is the number of rows and columns the zone will be split into. The number of splits must match the number of tiles in the zone.</p></div></div>
