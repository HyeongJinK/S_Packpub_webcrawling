Terrain grids are constructed from zones and we are going to start with the first button on the toolbar <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>. To <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>create terrain for our game we must start with zones.</p><p>Our volcano project will need a high level of detail, we're going to make an island of approximately 10 square kilometers. Since we want it to be reasonably detailed, we'll create it with the following values for a 5 square kilometer zone: </p><p>Size=5120, Tile no.=512, Tile size=10</p><p>Note that our map is not exactly 5 km since we like to use nice computing numbers which are a power of 2. The map measures exactly 5.12 km.</p><p>Next we'll mark out a quad of four zones (2 x 2) which will be the base of our map. When we're done with the values and the region we've marked, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button. A layer is automatically created and armed in the Workspace panel on the right-hand side.</p><p>We can check zones with <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> (select all). If we want to edit names after creation we need to bring up the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab on the Workspace panel and then navigate the tree view, right-click on an object to rename it. Objects must be <a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a>selected first.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_12.jpg" /></div><p>At this point, we have four zones containing a heightmap with a resolution of 512 x 512. As we're going to have the player mostly walking around the interior of the island, we want to increase the ground detail just around the central region which is where we will place our island. There is a really nice shortcut for increasing the mesh resolution in heightmap modifiers (it's called <a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a>Resample). However, we first need to add more zones in the middle. We could have created more zones initially but we'll assume for the purposes of this exercise that it never hurts to practice adding and removing zones. </p><p>To fix our map we're going to split existing zones to make new zones in the center. Then we'll delete the interior ones and rebuild them with twice as many tiles (1024). <a id="id79" class="indexterm"></a>It's a very simple process.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec18"></a>Splitting zones</h3></div></div></div><p>With all of the zones selected click on the <a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Splitter</strong></span> button. Set the <span class="strong"><strong>Split factor</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> (this will deselect everything, so reselect with <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> to see what happened to our zones). We should see something similar to the <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>following screenshot. Zones are now in a 4 x 4 arrangement.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_13.jpg" /></div><p>After splitting the zones we will be left with four new zones in the middle.

Set the value of <span class="strong"><strong>Tiles no</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>1024</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>The following screenshot shows what it should look like once we have selected the four interior zones:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_14.jpg" /></div><p>The newly created zones should have twice the ground resolution, <a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a>being a factor of two larger than surrounding zones.</p><p>Hot keys won't work if an edit box has focus. A Viewport must be active for hot keys to function.</p><p>If we move the camera closer to the border of zones of differing resolutions it might look like the next screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_15.jpg" /></div><p>If you have problems seeing the wireframe details you can adjust the LOD range by pressing the comma (<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span>) and period (<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span>) keys to reduce and increase the terrain LOD level respectively.</p><p>Now we're ready to start building some detail. Before we launch into the mind boggling possibilities of what GROME can do, let us save our project (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> to <a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a>save, or use the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu) and quickly try out some procedural terrain functions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"></a>Creating a simple procedural heightmap</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the Tool panel, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Modifiers</strong></span> icon (second icon, second row).</p></li><li><p>Change the drop-down box from <span class="strong"><strong>Heightmap</strong></span> to <a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a>

Not bad for one modifier but as they say in the music business, it needs more cowbell (in reference to a famous Saturday Night Live TV sketch). To get the best results, we're going to use a combination of several filters and a mask to create our volcanic island paradise. You can walk around it using "Walkcam" (press O or use the Viewport mode to switch). <a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a>When using a unit size of 1 unit per meter be sure to set the Walking Height to 2.0 meters in the <a id="id86" class="indexterm"></a>
