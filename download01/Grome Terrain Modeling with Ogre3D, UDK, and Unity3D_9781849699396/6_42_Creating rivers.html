Using the brush we paint the path of the river, lowering the terrain below the water plane. This is simple and very much hands on. </p><p>An alternative is to use a selection, this is great if we have some real-world <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>reference or diagram to use. Mark out the area of the river using a selection mask. Then use selection filters such as blur, extend, and smooth to give the area a more organic feel. Then, with the mask active, we apply the elevation tool to lower the terrain below the water line.</p><p>There are different ways you can work in river features and I strongly encourage experimentation.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec41"></a>Creating a small stepped river feature</h3></div></div></div><p>One approach is to have a stepped river and use multiple water layers.

Often games use particle systems to add foam and <a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a>splashing effects and complex shapes for specific bodies of water.</p></div></div>
