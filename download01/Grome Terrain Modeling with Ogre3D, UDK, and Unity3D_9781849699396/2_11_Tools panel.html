Hosting all the content-editing functions, the tools <a id="id61" class="indexterm"></a>panel is headed by three tabs to select from three kinds of editing. They are given as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Terrain</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>World (Roads)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Objects (instanced entities)</p></li></ul></div><p>Most of our work will be done with the Terrain tools. Working from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, the second row of icons are: Create (zone), Modifiers, Selection, Texturing, Details, and Water. This roughly follows the workflow in a GROME project. The Tool panel icons are shown as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_07.jpg" /></div></div>
