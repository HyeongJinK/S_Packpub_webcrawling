If you had to define a flow through the creation process it would look like the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_08.jpg" /></div><p>Starting with the creation of zones, we edit our heightmaps, paint and texture the landscape before adding landscape features such as roads, rivers, and vegetation. Finally, we export everything. Depending on our destination platform we might skip one or more of these stages and use native 3D game engine features for them. If the scope of the game is small you might use GROME for heightmap creation and painting everything else in the Unity 3D editor.</p><p>It is possible at any time to go back and change the density of a terrain grid if you need more (or less) detail.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Document the export process</strong></span>
</p><p>Make notes of all the export settings taking screenshots if necessary. You will forget which settings are needed for a particular build. Someone else might need to export the project and will thank you for it. Artists should have a book near them covering technical details of the art content pipeline; this is a good place to keep such information. If you don't have such a book, make one. Coffee ring stains are optional but make it look well used and professional.</p></div></div>
