<a id="id165" class="indexterm"></a>applications. In the Workspace panel find the layer stack mode's drop-down list; from here choose <span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong> Masks</strong></span>. Clicking on the "plus page" button adds a new mask layer.</p><p>As always we <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> assign a zone to the layer before we can do anything with it, so make a zone active (press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> and click on the viewport) and right-click on the layer and <span class="strong"><strong>Assign to selection</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_03_19.jpg" /></div><p>The mask layers needs to be <span class="emphasis"><em>armed</em></span> for use. Any masked areas will show by default as a red tinted area.</p><p>Once we have a layer for a mask we usually want to put something in it. The <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> panel has a <span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span> <a id="id166" class="indexterm"></a>tab containing all the tools for creating a mask. A <a id="id167" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id168" class="indexterm"></a>drop-down control under the tab helps choose between Brush and Procedural tools. The interface is nice and consistent in this manner.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_03_20.jpg" /></div><p>The brush-based selection tools provide methods for painting masks directly onto terrain. As with other brush tools the square bracket keys are handy shortcuts for changing brush diameter.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_03_21.jpg" /></div><p>The preceding screenshot shows an "X" painted on a mask layer using the <span class="strong"><strong>SelBrush</strong></span> tool. The image to the right-hand side shows the result of setting the level of the entire heightmap to 1,000 units. Only the terrain under the mask is altered. <a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id170" class="indexterm"></a>For an island we could draw or trace the outline onto a mask.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Lasso</strong></span> <a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a>method is selection by polygon; you draw a shape which completes when you release the mouse button. By default no hot keys are assigned to Select and Deselect modes, you can customize the keyboard command for this.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>SelectionFilters</strong></span> are a collection of operations that adjust the internal mask image, these include blur, invert, expand, and shrink. There's <a id="id172" class="indexterm"></a>some control over contrast and brightness of the mask. Use the Blur operation to create smooth outlines for the mask; we can use this method to create a gentle slope for a beach.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_03_22.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>ShapeSelect</strong></span> tool <a id="id173" class="indexterm"></a>requires a correctly formatted "ESRI" Shapefile which are typically geo-referenced files of roads, waterways, or other real-world map data. If you are modeling real-world areas and need to accurately import geographical features, this tool provides the facility for creating masks for them.</p><p>You can obtain ESRI (.SHP) data from a number of sources. The <a id="id174" class="indexterm"></a>OpenStreetMap is a good starting point as you can download the whole earth in a variety of projections from  <a class="ulink" href="http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/land-polygons" target="_blank">http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/land-polygons</a>.</p><p>A white paper describing the <a id="id175" class="indexterm"></a>file format can be located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf</a>.</p><p>The final toolset for selection masks are procedural â€“ <span class="strong"><strong>SelectionGen</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>FlowmapSelect</strong></span>. SelectionGen is <a id="id176" class="indexterm"></a>another one of the really handy GROME tools. It performs selection based on an altitude range, slope, and direction.</p><p>The final function is <a id="id177" class="indexterm"></a>FlowmapSelect which will generate a mask that fits the water channel network for your active zones. The Scale parameter adjusts the width of the selection.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>View Switching</strong></span>
</p><p>Sometimes it's better to get a pilot's-eye view when creating or tracing features. Switch the viewport mode to the "Top-down" mode by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> and zoom the camera out to fit your selection by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>.</p><p>Return to Freecam mode with the <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> key. </p></div></div>
