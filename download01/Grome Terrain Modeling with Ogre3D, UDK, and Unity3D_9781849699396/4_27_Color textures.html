This give the artist full control over feathering and shading effects.</p><p>Color textures really come into their own when combined with other layers to create tonal variations across a landscape on a zone-by-zone basis.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_03.jpg" /></div><p>In the preceding screenshot, the image on the left-hand side is our example island terrain with multiple texture layers added. The image on the right-hand side has an additional simple color layer assigned. This is a simple texture added for tonal variation. By setting the material blend mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Color Add</strong></span> (blend modes in GROME are referred to as "Shader configuration") the color from the texture is blended.</p><p>Each zone in the layer can have its own texture and blend <a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a>mode by activating the layer stack <a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Selected</strong></span> button and expanding the tree. Clicking on the texture assigned to each zone allows you to individually select the image file you want.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec27"></a>Ground holes</h3></div></div></div><p>Color layers are useful for creating a special mask that <a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a>hides selective areas of the terrain. When a layer uses the "<a id="id195" class="indexterm"></a>Ground Holes" Shader configuration, black pixels in the color texture will appear invisible (although the geometry is still present).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_04.jpg" /></div><p>This image shows a chequered board color texture using the Ground Hole shader. To work correctly the layer should be at the bottom of the stack (first rendered). This can be useful for embedding caves and basements which are 3D <a id="id196" class="indexterm"></a>objects that are often embedded into terrain.</p><p>By masking the terrain this way, it won't visually intersect with internal building spaces. Players might feel disturbed when entering a building only to pass through the ground on their way to the cellar.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec28"></a>Masked textures</h3></div></div></div><p>We mentioned masked textures earlier, most of the texture tools deal with modifying masks. Simply put, a masked texture type gives us the <a id="id197" class="indexterm"></a>means to selectively paint textures inside a zone.</p><p>By mixing different layers we create textures that match the topography of the landscape, one layer for grass, one for rock, one for cliff faces, one for snow, and so on. It's important to grasp that when you have a masked texture layer and you use a tool to paint it, what you're actually doing is painting the mask which controls visibility of the texture.</p><p>Black values in the mask equals no texture; <a id="id198" class="indexterm"></a>white areas of the mask represent full intensity. Like heightmaps, pixel intensity determines the end value.</p><p>When we use brushes or procedural functions to apply textures these operations are simply writing intensity values into the mask. This is similar to the technique known as "Splatting" used in some game engines.</p><p>To create a mask, first we can click on the empty image box in the mask selector (when empty, this has a large "X" through it). We can then select an image to use as a mask. Moreover, we can create a new mask by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>NEW</strong></span> button. This brings up a <span class="strong"><strong>New Image</strong></span> dialog (shown next).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_05.jpg" /></div><p>This dialog sets the resolution and initial color value written into the generated mask. If you need to set the mask so the texture is fully visible after creation, <a id="id199" class="indexterm"></a>change the color to solid <a id="id200" class="indexterm"></a>white (clicking on the color box brings up a standard color picker).</p></div></div>
