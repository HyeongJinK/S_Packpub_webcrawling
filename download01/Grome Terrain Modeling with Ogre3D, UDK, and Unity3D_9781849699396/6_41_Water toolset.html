The <a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a>waterBrush tool is useful for touching up small areas as required. The Brush tool paints directly to the coverage mask on the water plane. But generally we will make good use of the "water generator" <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>tool.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_05.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec39"></a>Generator tool</h3></div></div></div><p>First button in the <span class="strong"><strong>Procedural</strong></span> toolset is <span class="strong"><strong>Generator</strong></span> which creates the water mask based on terrain height. Very simple to use, the only parameter we might want to adjust is <span class="strong"><strong>Depth attenuation</strong></span>. This is how far in world <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>units we want to <a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a>see under the water plane. This is used to feather shoreline transparency. </p><p>The following is an image of a mask for a single zone, the dark areas are hidden. On the right-hand side is a 3D view of a zone where terrain has been flattened so that we can see the mask resolution along the shoreline.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_06.jpg" /></div><p>If the resolution of the mask is too low (or high), hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Resampler</strong></span> button <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>and set the resolution you want (remember to <a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a>use a valid power of 2 texture size).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec40"></a>Shoreline tool</h3></div></div></div><p>The final procedural tool is <span class="strong"><strong>Shoreline</strong></span> which is a <a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a>GROME/Graphite engine feature. This generates a <a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a>lot of polygons around the detected shoreline and applies an animated "foam" texture. This doesn't export to other engines, some have their own system for achieving this effect and some are entirely done at the shader level and require no extra geometry. But it's nice to add that finishing touch to a water scene.</p><p>With our zone selected and the layer "armed", we can use the default values or even better, one of the presets, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>. After a short while we see the generated shoreline object as a red and green outline. The green lines are calculated normals of the shoreline.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_06_07.jpg" /></div></div></div>
