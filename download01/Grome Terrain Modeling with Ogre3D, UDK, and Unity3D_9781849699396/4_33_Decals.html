<span class="strong"><strong>Decals</strong></span> are individual objects that project images down onto a surface. While individual game engines might support some kind of decal system, they will not translate. It's not possible to bake decal objects into a texture prior to export but as objects they can be exported. However; the onus is on the end user and the host engine to load and handle them. We'll have a quick look at the Decal tool.</p><p>Before creating any decals you must (as with all other tools) create a Decal layer on the layer stack then assign at least one terrain zone to the new layer. When you click on <span class="strong"><strong>Assign to selection</strong></span> the <span class="strong"><strong>New Decal Layer</strong></span> dialog appears. <a id="id245" class="indexterm"></a>This is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_15.jpg" /></div><p>Decals are treated as individual objects you can position with the mouse. They lay flat with the terrain but they are made from triangular meshes that are updated with terrain height information when you edit them. They share the same resolution as the containing zone, consequently having lots of large decals on a high resolution mesh will really eat into you polygon budget. However, they are useful for placing spot effects or serving as markers for spawn points.</p><p>Each decal has its own size, rotation, and scale parameters. You edit these by selecting the decal with the Decal tool active and applying the desired values in the tool rollup.</p><p>The layer stack <a id="id246" class="indexterm"></a>panel in Decal mode allows you to set a fade-in and fade-out distance for the decal set.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_16.jpg" /></div><p>By setting the <a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> drop-down box to <span class="strong"><strong>Diffuse and shadow</strong></span>, you can combine the decal texture with the contents of a shadowmap by selecting the layer in the <span class="strong"><strong>Source</strong></span> drop-down box.</p><p>Decals can also use what's called a texture atlas. A texture atlas is simply a single texture file that contains a collection of images, such as sprites or a bitmap font. Somewhere an atlas description file will contain an index and coordinates on the texture for any image contained in the atlas. The most basic form of texture atlas is an evenly spaced grid where each cell contains one image. This is supported by GROME Decals by specifying the <span class="strong"><strong>Atlas width</strong></span> and <a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Atlas height</strong></span> properties for an image.</p><p>To move decals around, click and drag the large green dot on the selected instance (instances have a red border when selected). To manipulate decals two conditions must be satisfied. First, the decal layer must be armed; secondly a decal tool must be active. All the decals in the layer will have a yellow border when both conditions are met.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_04_17.jpg" /></div><p>This screenshot shows a decal of an oversized helipad, note the mesh near perfectly matches the uneven water channels of the terrain mesh. Additionally, the <span class="strong"><strong>Diffuse and shadow</strong></span> material is using the shadowmap layer, which is then blended over the top of the decals diffuse texture. How smart is that?</p></div>
