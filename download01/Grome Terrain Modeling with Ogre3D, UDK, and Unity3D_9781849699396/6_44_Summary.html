We also touched upon using several water planes to create multilevel water effects like the previous one. Then we explored the road tools, creating spline objects and using them as a terrain modifier.</p><p>In the final chapter, we export the terrain into three different 3D engines: Unity, Unreal Development Kit, and Ogre3D. Prepare for the final chapter, this is game development where some assembly is required and batteries are never included.</p></div>
