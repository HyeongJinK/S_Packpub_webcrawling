Both of these panels <a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a>are headed by two rows of tabs which we make good use of, so get familiar with them.</p><p>The first row is like a master mode and the second row of tabs gives access to the submode. The Workspace panel is located to the left-hand side of the viewports in the default interface layout.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"></a>Workspace tab</h3></div></div></div><p>Workspace is an overview of what our current scene <a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a>contains, scene settings, layers, and any objects we're using. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"></a>Scene tab</h3></div></div></div><p>The scene tab allows access to how a scene is rendered and contains <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>settings for the camera <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>field of view (FOV), camera range, lighting, and fog. This is illustrated in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_03.jpg" /></div><p>We can adjust how a fog <a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a>is rendered by changing the color and range through the scene.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on the Workspace master mode (first tab icon).</p></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab to bring up the scene tree.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Fog</strong></span> node and select <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.</p></li></ol></div><p>You can add a little blue to the fog color to make the scene a little more realistic and depending on how big our scene is, we might need to change the fog distances.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_03_1.jpg" /></div><p>You can adjust the camera <a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a>FOV (field of view) and the first-person camera mode walk-height. The walk-height is specified in world units. If you're working in meters you might want to set this value to 2. By default this is set to 180 which is <a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>perfect if you're working in centimeters (1.8 meters is about human height).</p><p>The other nodes are not going to see much use. <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Georeference</strong></span> is an advanced option used to embed information about real-world positions in your scenery. The unit's node will only affect how data is exported to some formats; it won't scale your scene in any way.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_04.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"></a>Layer stack</h3></div></div></div><p>The predominant tab on the Workspace panel is the <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> layer stack pane. <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>Layers in GROME work in a similar fashion to other image editing software. Layer content is applied in a bottom-up fashion. An example layer stack would <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>ideally have an imported heightmap in the bottom-most layer; on top of which we add special features such as hills followed by a noise layer. If instead of adding landscaping features such as rivers and roads (which may need to be adjusted later), we add layers for each of them, it would give us the freedom to edit without modifying the base terrain.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_05.jpg" /></div><p>The two folded-page icons are used for adding and deleting layers. Clicking on the "+", add layer, button creates an empty layer on top of the stack. Each layer is displayed with two icons and its default name (for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Heightmap Layer 0</strong></span>). The first icon is the "ARM" button; when this is active (red) it indicates that edits can be applied to this layer. The following image shows a layer with the armed and visible icons active.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849699396/graphics/9182_02_06.jpg" /></div><p>When the "ARM" <a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a>button is gray then tools have no effect on this layer, this is often necessary as we usually only want to apply tools to a few of <a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a>them. The second icon is the layer visibility button. Toggle this to show and hide the effects of this layer.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"></a>Layer type selector</h3></div></div></div><p>The drop-down box next to the layer buttons selects the type of <a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a>layer to display. The full list of available layer types are given as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Heightmaps</strong></span> <a id="id50" class="indexterm"></a>represent terrain topography and can be merged together as layers.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Meshes</strong></span> are 3D models <a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a>generated from the terrain grid, this is useful for iPhone and Android platforms or engines that don't have any native terrain support.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Selection Masks</strong></span> are used to <a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a>protect areas of your terrain when performing operations.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> are the texture and <a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a>color layers. Creative use of texturing, shaders, and blending of layers can yield impressive results.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Decals</strong></span> are special <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>polygons that are projected flat onto the terrain surface.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Details</strong></span> are high-performance <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>3D models. For example, many copies of the same tree model are used to make forests. Detail layers are used to place rocks, grass, trees, and so on.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Objects</strong></span> are individual <a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a>3D models, buildings, signs, rubble, and so on. You can make good use of object layers for cross-platform requirements.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Water layers</strong></span> are simple planes at a <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>set height. Coverage masks for each zone are exported as a grayscale texture.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Roads</strong></span> are <a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a>spline-based objects that can modify underlying terrain to fit.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"></a>Selection filter</h3></div></div></div><p>The usefulness of the selection filter will become apparent when you start to build complex scenes requiring careful navigation. If you have hundreds of similar objects in a scene such as a lamppost and you need to find a particular one you can type the name or number into the filter control here. </p><p>If you are going to use GROME to place 3D objects into <a id="id59" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id60" class="indexterm"></a>scenes you should think about naming conventions when crafting your scene. Object names can be exported to the host engine, if your game has code that needs to send values to all objects of a certain type then it will help to embed some ID into the object name. You might want to get the team together to plan a suitable object naming scheme if they are to be used in code or game logic. If you have to edit names in the host engine after exporting (such as the Unity3D or UDK editor) all changes will be lost whenever you reexport the project. You might as well fix it at the source early on and get it right.</p></div></div>
