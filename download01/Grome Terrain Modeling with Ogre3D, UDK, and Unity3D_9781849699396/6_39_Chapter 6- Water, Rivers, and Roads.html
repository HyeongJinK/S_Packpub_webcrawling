From a player's perspective, rivers and roads are easy to follow, they guide us between places of interest. They provide barriers to different zones and give us something pretty to look at.</p><p>Water is one of <a id="id292" class="indexterm"></a>those elements highly dependent on the quality of textures and shaders used. In older game engines, water was a simple 3D plane (or quad) with a reflective surface and maybe an animated normal map to simulate surface movement. Game engines such as Unity use this simple water plane technique. UDK features an actor that's capable of sophisticated physics-based water interaction; drop an object into UDK water and it sends dynamic ripples across the surface. UDK even does water refraction but these effects do come at a price. <a id="id293" class="indexterm"></a>GROME is more like Unity, it uses a simple plane on which an animated material is applied. The basic water material has some nice options to adjust the color, opacity, and reflectivity of the water surface.</p><p>For our game we will rely on the game engine's native water effects (where possible), only the OgreGrome library (we will discuss in the final chapter) directly supports GROMEs water objects. But even as a placeholder we can use the water in GROME so we can model our scene.</p><p>At the end of this chapter we'll look at roads which are not part of the terrain modeling toolset but are part of what are called <a id="id294" class="indexterm"></a>spline objects. A <a id="id295" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>spline</strong></span> is a way of describing a complex curve using two or more points (what are known as <a id="id296" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>control points</em></span>). We can attach any texture to a spline object, plus they have the ability to deform heightmaps (with parameters for adjusting camber and width). Because of this we can use splines not only to model roads but also as a rudimentary terrain modeling tool for streams if we wanted. Let's put on our waders and jump right in.</p></div>
