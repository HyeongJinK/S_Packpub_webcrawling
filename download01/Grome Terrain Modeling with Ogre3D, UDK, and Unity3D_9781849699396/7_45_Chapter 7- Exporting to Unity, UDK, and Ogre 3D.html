While Unity and UDK are game engines (although they certainly have uses beyond games), Ogre3D is a 3D rendering engine which doesn't have functions for audio or user input, but it's open source and quite flexible. We'll be taking a look at a the OgreGrome SDK which implements GROME's Graphite engine for Ogre3D. </p></div>
