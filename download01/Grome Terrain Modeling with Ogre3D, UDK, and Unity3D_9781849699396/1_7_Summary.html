We touched upon world sizes and limitations commonly found in 3D engines. We then examined a brief for a hypothetical game, sketched out a map in preparation before finally creating a new GROME project file. In the next chapter, we'll look at how the interface is arranged and work through the toolset as we get to grips with the interface. </p><p>In the next chapter, we're going to look at the workspace and the all-important layer stack.</p></div>
