This may be in how much <a id="id865" class="indexterm"></a>gold they collect from the fallen enemies to buy swanky new gear and that Level 20 battle sword with flame powers they have had their eye on for weeks.

In fact, in some titles, this is the whole focus of the game; you spend more time planning what skills to have or upgrade as you progress on to explore/fight.</p><p>One piece of advice I would give is to ensure that you have some sort of whole-world experience system, not just focus on the battles. This will make you stand out from the crowd. You can have skills and strengths the player can use to affect the whole game; it should be about the game experience and not just the fight.
