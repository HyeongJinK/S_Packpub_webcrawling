Hopefully, you have learned a lot.</p><p>From here on, you should look at planning for some sort of skill tree and putting a simple UI in place that the user can access to either spend the experience he or she has gained or level up certain skills.</p><p>The sample has more features implemented if you want to see the end result, but I'll recommend reusing what you have learned and build it yourself. The best way to learn is through re-enforcement and testing yourself.</p><p>We covered the factors that make a battle, a more advanced GUI with 2D, mixing 2D and 3D and what to look out for, working with particle effects and animation, and more animation know-how.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at packaging your game and making it a bit more than just a couple of game screens.</p></div>
