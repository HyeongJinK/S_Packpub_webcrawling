With these tools in hand, we can make building our games a lot easier and customize Unity to fit our game (rather than the other way a round). The editor is there to help us build our game, so why not improve it.</p><p>Several developers graciously share their editor scripts and work in open source libraries, so be sure to look around; you don't need to start from scratch.</p><p>We also looked into what is involved in finishing and packaging the game itself with menus and important touch points if you want to stand out.</p><p>We covered editor customization, property drawers, custom editors, editor windows, and Gizmos. We also covered architecting the game package with screens and menus and working with saving and loading data.</p><p>In the next chapter, we look at packaging the game on to several platforms and extending our game out on to the platform itself and providing platform-specific features either in the game or beyond.</p></div>
