We also dug deeper into how Unity can interact with the platforms you deploy to, above all when involving the platform, and have a plan on how you will implement that same feature on all the platforms you want to deploy to, or else users will notice that some versions (yes, quite a few have multiple) lack more than others.</p><p>So, we covered extending your Unity project onto the platform, plugins and their extensions, building your very own reusable assets, and tips and tricks for marketing your title.</p><p>Something you can try when you engage with a platform is to look at engaging across platforms, building titles that work cooperatively, enabling either a true multiplatform, multiplayer experience, or even building cooperative apps/games (where the phone version of a game can act as a second screen for your tablet/console version), as this is where dreams truly become alive!</p></div>
