Keep the player engaged and try to make each battle different in some way, as receptiveness is a tricky problem to solve and you don't want to bore the player.</p><p>Think about expanding the shops and the items they stock.

Possibly, look to have different types of inventory items, potions, shields, and so on.</p><p>We covered the following in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What makes a battle</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Planning to expand your game and how it should look</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with state machines in the code</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with better 2D GUI elements, such as the command bar</p></li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will continue the battle and set out to teach those pesky goblins a lesson or two.</p></div>
