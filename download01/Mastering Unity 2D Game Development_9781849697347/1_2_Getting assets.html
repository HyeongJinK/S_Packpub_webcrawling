There are plenty of resources available to the game developers these days either as placement assets for the developer's use, whether they are full assets, or just a framework that you can tweak to get your desired result. There are a multitude of options.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>In the code bundle of this book, you'll get all the assets that you need to follow on during the creation of the game, and the site where it is available online will be listed with the instructions.</p></div><p>Some of the best sites to gather assets are described as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Art</strong></span>: Art, especially 2D art, is generally easy to find on a budget; particularly for the<a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a> placeholder art until you buy or create your own<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> for the finished product (although I've seen many games created with some of these assets).

Free sites are okay, but they generally don't have the right sound you will want or you will<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> end up digging through hundreds or more sounds to get a close match. A good website to start is at <a class="ulink" href="http://soundbible.com/" target="_blank">http://soundbible.com/</a>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>We won't actually be covering audio as part of this title, as not much has changed since the introduction of Unity 4.0.
