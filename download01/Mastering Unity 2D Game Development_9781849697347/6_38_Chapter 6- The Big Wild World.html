It's important to keep the player engaged and make them feel that they are entering a vast arena with lots of places to explore, especially when you initially release your game and you only have a few towns to visit.</p><p>Another thing to consider is whether you want fixed maps in your game or you want to venture down the rabbit hole of procedural generation. Both are valid routes and there's nothing to say that you only have to use one. In this chapter, we'll cover all the options and then implement a nice and simple system to walk through the basics.</p><p>The following is a list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Resources to build a map</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Structuring and adding points of interest</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with prefabs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Transitioning between views</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Marshaling input</p></li></ul></div></div>
