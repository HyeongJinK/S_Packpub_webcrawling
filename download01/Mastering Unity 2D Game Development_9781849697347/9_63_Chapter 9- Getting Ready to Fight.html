This brings to light one of the hardest parts of any game development: engagement. This centers on how you can keep the players playing the game in effect, how the game balances out to keep them challenged, and how to deliver enough varied content so they feel they are always experiencing something new.</p><p>So we'll start with a few finishing touches to the game's battle system itself and then look at deepening the background of the game.</p><p>Unlike previous chapters, the focus here will be on the implementation, showing you quite a few tips and tricks and helping you avoid some of the pitfalls of the sometimes strange Unity way of doing things. Also, as we have much to cover, this chapter will flow on to the next to give you time to pause, reflect, and then carry on.</p><p>The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Preparing battle statistics and creating the game's UI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing the turn-based battle system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with Mecanim in the code</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building more advanced sprite 2D GUI systems</p></li></ul></div></div>
