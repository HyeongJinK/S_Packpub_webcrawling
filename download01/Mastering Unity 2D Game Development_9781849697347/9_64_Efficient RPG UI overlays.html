If the information is too obscure, the player won't understand when they are close to death (and should run far away) or struggle to understand why their favorite magic trick just isn't going as well as it should. Similarly, if you make the UI too obtrusive, draw players' attention away too much, and obscure the real estate on the screen too much, then the result will be the same.</p><p>This balance is hard to maintain in any game, especially in RPG games, because we want to give as many capabilities as possible to our budding adventurer. It gets even harder once you start adding companions and hundreds of available skills and instant use items.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec113"></a>The adventurer's overlay</h3></div></div></div><p>Games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Baldur's Gate</em></span> (developed by Black Isle Studios) and many of the difficult and true RPG games <a id="id781" class="indexterm"></a>from the 80s took the style of surrounding the <a id="id782" class="indexterm"></a>player with everything at hand.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_09_01.jpg" /></div><p>In the preceding screenshot, we see all the party members to the right, all the menu options to the left, and quick use items/skills laid at the bottom of the screen. Although functional, this style of design leaves only a small portion of the screen for the actual gameplay. As these were mostly PC titles and large screens were available, this wasn't too much of an issue.</p><p>Today, with smartphones<a id="id783" class="indexterm"></a> and 10-inch tablets being the norm, this <a id="id784" class="indexterm"></a>would create a large issue.

In this game, it was possible to change the overlay based on what was selected, allowing the selection of a character of the player's party to be displayed on the screen; this helped to change the details shown to that character.</p><p>Buttons were added to provide pop-up sections for skills, character attributes, and the map.</p><p>It also <a id="id787" class="indexterm"></a>provided two modes: one for traveling and one <a id="id788" class="indexterm"></a>for battle, each distinctly different based on what the player would need at the time.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec115"></a>Modern floating UI approach</h3></div></div></div><p>A popular <a id="id789" class="indexterm"></a>pattern that fits more modern titles is to use floating elements<a id="id790" class="indexterm"></a> on the player's screen, taking advantages of the improvements that <span class="emphasis"><em>Fallout</em></span> implemented and extending them much further.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_09_03.jpg" /></div><p>Mobile games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Pylon</em></span> (developed by QuantumSquid Interactive) follow the standard of breaking up the important UI for the player and scaling/placing them on top of the main gameplay's screen.
