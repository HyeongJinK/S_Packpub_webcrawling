To ensure that you have all the bases covered, you need to start a new project. For 2D, however, you<a id="id109" class="indexterm"></a> need to ensure that you start the project using the<a id="id110" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="emphasis"><em>2D game template</em></span> in the Unity <a id="id111" class="indexterm"></a>New Project wizard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>If you accidentally leave the 3D option set (which is the default) as is, don't worry! You can change this at any<a id="id112" class="indexterm"></a> time for your project through <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Settings</strong></span>. To open <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Settings</strong></span>, simply navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_02_08.jpg" /></div><p>Lastly, let's create<a id="id113" class="indexterm"></a> the folder structure for the project, as shown in the following screenshot, using the guidance provided earlier:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_02_09.jpg" /></div><p>At this point, it's important to note that we will most likely not use all of these folders during the course of <a id="id114" class="indexterm"></a>the book.
