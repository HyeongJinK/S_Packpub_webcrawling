So, from the asset pack you downloaded earlier, grab the following assets from the <code class="literal">Environments</code> pack, place them in <code class="literal">Assets\Sprites\Environment</code>, and name them as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Name the <code class="literal">ENVIRONMENTS\ STEAMPUNK\background01.png</code> file <code class="literal">Assets\ Sprites\Environment\background01</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Name the <code class="literal">ENVIRONMENTS\STEAMPUNK\environmentalAssets.png</code> file <code class="literal">Assets\Sprites\Environment\environmentalAssets</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Name<a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a> the <code class="literal">ENVIRONMENTS\FANTASY\environmentalAssets.png</code> file <code class="literal">Assets\ Sprites\Environment\environmentalAssets2</code></p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec36"></a>To slice or not to slice</h3></div></div></div><p>As we progress through this book, you will notice that some assets are single textures, whereas others contain multiple images and you may wonder which method is best to create your<a id="id318" class="indexterm"></a> assets and why it is best.</p><p>The answer (as it is in a lot of these situations) depends on the needs of your title.</p><p>It is always better to pack many of the same images on to a single asset/atlas and then use the Sprite Editor to define the regions on that texture for each sprite, as long as all the sprites on that sheet are going to get used in the same scene. The reason for this is when Unity tries to draw to the screen, it needs to send the images to draw to the graphics card; if there are many images to send, this can take some time. If, however, it is just one image, it is a lot simpler and more performant with only one file to send.</p><p>There needs to be a balance; too large an image and the upload to the graphics card can take up too many resources, too many individual images and you have the same problem.</p><p>The basic <a id="id319" class="indexterm"></a>rule of thumb is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If the background is a full screen background or large image, then keep it separate.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you have many images and all are for the same scene, then put them into a single spritesheet/atlas.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you have many images but all are for different scenes, then group them as best you canâ€”common items on one sheet and scene-specific items on different sheets. You'll have several spritesheets to use.</p></li></ul></div><p>You basically want to keep as much stuff together as makes sense and not send unnecessary images that won't get used to the graphics card. Find your balance.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec37"></a>The town background</h3></div></div></div><p>First, let's<a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a> add <a id="id321" class="indexterm"></a>a background for the town using the <code class="literal">Assets\Sprites\Environment\background01</code> texture. It is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_01.jpg" /></div><p>With the<a id="id322" class="indexterm"></a> background asset, we don't need to do anything else <a id="id323" class="indexterm"></a>other than ensure that it has been imported as a sprite (in case your project is still in 3D mode), as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_02.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"></a>The town buildings</h3></div></div></div><p>For the<a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a> steampunk environmental assets (<code class="literal">Assets\Sprites\Environment\environmentalAssets</code>) that are shown in the following <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>screenshot, we need a bit more work; once these assets are imported, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Multiple</code> and load up the Sprite Editor using the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_03.jpg" /></div><p>Next, click<a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button, leave the settings at their default <a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a>options, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button in the new window as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_04.jpg" /></div><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> and close the Sprite Editor.

If we look at the <code class="literal">Fantasy</code> environment pack (<code class="literal">Assets\Sprites\Environment\environmentalAssets2</code>), we will see the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_06.jpg" /></div><p>After you<a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a> have imported it and run the <span class="strong"><strong>Split</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>, you will<a id="id331" class="indexterm"></a> notice that one of the sprites does not get detected very well; altering the automatic split settings in this case doesn't help, so we need to do some manual manipulation as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_07.jpg" /></div><p>In the <a id="id332" class="indexterm"></a>previous screenshot, you can see that just two of the rocks in the <a id="id333" class="indexterm"></a>top-right sprite have been identified by the splicing routine. To fix this, just delete one of the selections and then expand the other manually using the selection points in the corner of the selection box (after clicking on the sprite box). Here's how it will look before the correction:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_08.jpg" /></div><p>After <a id="id334" class="indexterm"></a>correction, you should see something like the following<a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a> screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_09.jpg" /></div><p>This gives us<a id="id336" class="indexterm"></a> some nice additional assets to scatter around our <a id="id337" class="indexterm"></a>towns and give it a more homely feel, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849697347/graphics/7347OT_04_10.jpg" /></div></div></div>
