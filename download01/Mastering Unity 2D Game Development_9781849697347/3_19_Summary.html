I've not covered everything as that would deserve another book entirely, so feel free to experiment further. The Mecanim system isn't just for animation either, and we will return to this later on.</p><p>We covered an overview of all the main Sprite animation components (<span class="strong"><strong>Animator,</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Clips</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Keyframes</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Curves</strong></span>), importing new sprites, animating sprites and controlling states, improving animations, and structuring renderers.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will build an environment for our character to walk around in, with environments, sprite layers, and scene navigation.</p></div>
