It's an important first step as most of your game's core logic and framework generally centers on the main protagonist and highlights exactly how the player will interact with the game.</p><p>Here, we are aiming to create a 2.5D style in-game world where the player can explore each town and have random encounter scenes to fight off those pesky bad guys. So, first we need to get our character in and moving.</p><p>The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing a good class structure</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Planning and designing behaviors</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Importing sprites</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up user control effectively</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>For this game, we will use the excellent, free<a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Unity games starter kit</strong></span> resources, which can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://wootstudio.ca/win8platstarter" target="_blank">http://wootstudio.ca/win8platstarter</a> (towards the bottom of the page).</p><p>There are several different themed sets of assets for use in any game (commercial or otherwise).
