Each appeals to a different audience and dramatically alters how your game is perceived. In many cases, the battles (apart from the story) will make up the heart and soul of your game; if you get this wrong, it's a quick one way - try to uninstall purgatory.</p><p>No matter which path you choose, the enemies that the player will face have to be challenging at all times.
