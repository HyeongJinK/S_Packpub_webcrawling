Depending on the style or background of your design, it may be even more important than the story or battle system. The reason I say this is because the way in which you'd design and implement your shopping and inventory system will alter how your game is played and how quickly the player will progress through your creation.</p><p>Another factor that we will cover in this chapter is <span class="strong"><strong>monetization</strong></span>. Every title needs to have a <a id="id667" class="indexterm"></a>monetization story so that the player will eventually be able to make money through his or her hard work. There always has to be some kickback in the end to help you pay the bills or keep tabs on your sanity. It doesn't have to be money; it could just be recognition or an aid to your portfolio. However, in most cases, it's about money.</p><p>The list of topics that will be covered in this chapter is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Looking at the inventory and items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building a shop and an inventory UI layer</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Looking at monetization options</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Handling back navigation</p></li></ul></div></div>
