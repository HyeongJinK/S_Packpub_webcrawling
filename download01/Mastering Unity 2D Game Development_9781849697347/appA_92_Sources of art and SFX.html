However, there are many great resources to get assets for your title, even if they are only placeholders until you find a designer who is worthy of your vision. The following are some of the best places to start your journey from:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>One of the latest marketplaces to spring up plenty of assets is the new GameDev Market. It is chock-full of 2D, 3D, textures, and even sample GUI art of which <a id="id1355" class="indexterm"></a>some are paid and some free. If you wish, you can also sell your own assets. The store is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gamedevmarket.net/" target="_blank">https://www.gamedevmarket.net/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If free art helps you begin your title (sometimes even finish it), then one of the biggest<a id="id1356" class="indexterm"></a> sites is the OpenGameArt site. It has hordes of free-to-use assets, from spritesheets to textures and even audio, and it is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">http://opengameart.org/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The VG resource is a forum-based art system where you can download or even <a id="id1357" class="indexterm"></a>request art and SFX. It is well worth a look (so long as you wear shades) and is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vg-resource.com/" target="_blank">http://www.vg-resource.com/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Another <a id="id1358" class="indexterm"></a>source of freely available assets under a creative commons license is the aptly named search site, <a class="ulink" href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">http://search.creativecommons.org/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As we had an entire chapter in this title where we worked with maps, it only seems fair<a id="id1359" class="indexterm"></a> to point out this free resource for maps at <a class="ulink" href="http://freefantasymaps.org/" target="_blank">http://freefantasymaps.org/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A good review of some of the other most common map solutions out there for titles can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nevermetpress.com/six-rpg-map-making-solutions-for-your-game#.U6V1LvldURq" target="_blank">http://nevermetpress.com/six-rpg-map-making-solutions-for-your-game#.U6V1LvldURq</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Inspiration is hard to come by at times, so the following sites are well worth browsing for the next big idea (some assets can be used, just check the license):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">https://www.tumblr.com/</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">https://www.pinterest.com/</a></p></li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you <a id="id1360" class="indexterm"></a>are looking for some cool effects, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://dm4331-sidm-s1-2012-06.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/updates-for-healing-and-fire-effects.html" target="_blank">http://dm4331-sidm-s1-2012-06.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/updates-for-healing-and-fire-effects.html</a>.
