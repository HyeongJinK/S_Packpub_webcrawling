Fixed systems are easy to implement but limit replayability (game becomes dull in the second or subsequent runs), whereas random systems can be trickier to get the balance right but it also mean the player will likely keep playing longer or get irritated very quickly.</p><p>Finding the<a id="id585" class="indexterm"></a> balance between implementing events is a tricky process, which you will have to find the right sweet spot for in your particular game, and inevitably all games implement this differently.</p><p>Also, remember that there is no silver bullet and no reason not to use both systems together, using fixed systems to tell a story and random events to keep it interesting.</p></div>
