Select <span class="strong"><strong>Single</strong></span> from the drop-down menu.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel to Units</strong></span> property defines how many pixels in the sprite are there in one unit (1 unit is 1 meter in Unity) in the game world. We don't need to edit this property; you can leave it at its default value of <span class="strong"><strong>100</strong></span>. Remember, however, that this gets important if you plan to use physics in your game. We <a id="id465" class="indexterm"></a>recommend the guide at <a class="ulink" href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/736142/what-is-good-practice-to-set-pixels-to-units-to-an.html" target="_blank">http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/736142/what-is-good-practice-to-set-pixels-to-units-to-an.html</a> for this matter. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to save these settings. You can refer to the following screenshot to understand the last steps:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>The base sprite for our <a id="id466" class="indexterm"></a>2D character is ready. Create new <span class="strong"><strong>Empty</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and name it <span class="strong"><strong>2DCharacter</strong></span>, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_04.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now you can drag the<a id="id467" class="indexterm"></a> sprite named <span class="strong"><strong>2D_pose</strong></span> onto <span class="strong"><strong>2DCharacter</strong></span> in the scene. Once you do so, a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component is automatically attached to <span class="strong"><strong>2DCharacter</strong></span>, and a <span class="strong"><strong>Default-Sprite</strong></span> material is created, with the <span class="strong"><strong>2D_pose </strong></span>sprite as the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> entry of the component, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_05.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec190"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>A sprite is a<a id="id468" class="indexterm"></a> 2D image applied to a flat object on a screen. We set our sprite as <span class="strong"><strong>Single</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Mode</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, as this sprite contains only one image, representing the static pose of our 2D character. Then we applied the sprite through a material to an empty game object on screen, as we already did with 3D assets.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec191"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id469" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component, which Unity automatically applied to the game object we dragged the image on, is a default component of Unity, and its task is to display images on the screen. It requires a sprite texture to render and refers to a default sprite material that can be instantiated at will in the game scene, displaying different textures for different game objects. This way you don't have to worry about creating several materials when you have many sprites on screen. They will all use the same material with different textures!</p><p>The Sprite Renderer also allows us to define the depth order in which sprites must be rendered on the screen. Though 2D games don't operate in the third dimension (<span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>), it may still come in handy to put different sprites in a specific order if the flat images overlap at some points and you want one specific chunk of the sprite to be rendered above the others. We will discuss these features in the following recipes, but those of you who want to delve more into the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>right now can check out the manual at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html</a>.</p></div></div>
