Mecanim<a id="id184" class="indexterm"></a> is a proprietary tool of Unity in which the animation clips belonging to a character are represented as boxes connected by directional arrows. Boxes represent states, which you can simply think of as idle, walk, run...you get the idea.</p><p>Arrows, on<a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a> the other hand, represent the transitions between the states, which are responsible for actually blending between one animation clip and the next. Thanks to transitions, we can make characters that pass smoothly, for example, from a walking animation into a running one.</p><p>The control of transitions is achieved<a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a> through parameters: variables belonging to different types that are stored in the character animator and are used to define and check the conditions that trigger an animation clip. The types available are common in programming and scripting languages: <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">float</code>, and <code class="literal">bool</code>. A distinctive type implemented in<a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a> Mecanim is the trigger, which is useful when you want a transition to be triggered as an all-or-nothing event. By the way, an animator is a built-in component of Unity, strictly connected with the Mecanim system, which is represented as a panel in the Unity interface. Inside this panel, the so-called animation tree of a character is actually built-up and the control parameters for the transitions are set and linked to the clips.</p><p>Time for an image to help you better understand what we are talking about! The following picture shows an example of an animator of a <a id="id188" class="indexterm"></a>standard game character:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>As you can see, there are four states connected by transitions that configure the logic of the flow between one state and another. Inside these arrows, the parameters and their reference values to actually trigger the animations are stored.</p><p>With Mecanim, it's quite easy to build the animation tree of a character and create the logic that determines the conditions for the animations to be played. One example is to use a <code class="literal">float</code> variable to blend between a walking and a running cycle, having the speed of the character as the control parameter. Using a <code class="literal">trigger</code> or a <code class="literal">boolean</code> variable to add a jumping animation to the character is another fairly common example. These are the subjects of our following two recipes, starting with trigger-based blending.</p><p>We follow on from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Importing 3D Models and Animations</em></span>, where you learned how to import the animation clips for a game character.
