In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>2D Assets for Unity</em></span>, we described how simple materials are imported and created in Unity. Now that we have a true character for the prototype, we can discuss materials in more detail. In the following recipe, we create a material that requires two textures.</p><p>The material for the character we are working with requires two textures: one to provide the basic color of the mesh and another for the details of bumps and lights falling onto the mesh. The first texture or map is technically called the diffuse map of the character and, simply put, contains the information on how colors are distributed on the mesh surface without any lighting. The second is usually addressed as the normal map and it is the result of a computation to determine how light would strike the surface of the model, based on a very detailed version of that model commonly named high poly (meaning the model is made out of a large number of polygons). When creating video games, it is crucial to save as much memory as possible. Simulating the effect of lights on a mesh by using a map that applies the information obtained from a very detailed model to a low poly version of it is a commonly used technique to achieve such a result. This technique is called normal mapping.</p><p>Normal maps and texture mapping, in general, are two wide topics. For those of you who want to delve more into the matter, we suggest starting with these<a id="id238" class="indexterm"></a> Wikipedia <a id="id239" class="indexterm"></a>links: <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping</a>.</p><p>Sorry for the parenthesis; it was necessary to at least introduce the subject before the recipe. Let's see how to create detailed materials to be applied to a game character.</p></div>
