In traditional sprite animation, animation clips are obtained by displaying several images in a sequence, each representing a stage (or keyframe) of the complete animation. These groups of images in sequence are referred to as spritesheets and they are the building blocks of sprite animation.</p><p>In the following recipe, we show you how to set a <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>Multiple Mode Sprite Texture to create a cycle that shows our 2D sprite walking.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec192"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>You should have already imported both the sprites we provided during the previous lesson, so do it now if you haven't.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec193"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Move to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and <a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a>access the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span> folder. Now select <span class="strong"><strong>2D_walk</strong></span> to access the image properties in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>Set <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> as we did before, but this time, set <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple</strong></span>, as this sprite contains several steps of the walking cycle. You can refer to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_10.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>To open<a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> panel, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> button that just appeared.</p></li><li><p>Here, we can make arrangements so that Unity splits the image the way we need it to work for the animation cycle. Right now, the image is displayed as whole containing many instances of Mario. What we want is that each instance in the image gets nicely separated from the others by a selection box. To do this, hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> button in the top-left corner of the panel, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_11.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Set the<a id="id474" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Center</strong></span>, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Method</strong></span> property to <span class="strong"><strong>Delete Existing</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Don't bother about the <span class="strong"><strong>Minimum Size </strong></span>property, for now. Instead, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Slice</strong></span> to apply the slicing process. As a result, each Mario instance in the image should now be surrounded by a thin white line, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_12.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now hit<a id="id475" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> in the top-right corner of the panel to apply the edits to our multiple sprites, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_13.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>The sprite <a id="id476" class="indexterm"></a>has been now split into 17 chunks, each representing a step, or frame, of the cycle of the animation of walking. You can verify this by expanding the hierarchy of <span class="strong"><strong>2D_walk</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_08_14.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec194"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>As we discussed <a id="id477" class="indexterm"></a>in a previous chapter, combining several small images into a larger image is an efficient technique to save memory when making video games. It also allows us to have several sprites on the same image rendered with a single draw call (a technique usually referred to as batching). See <a class="ulink" href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/32910/what-is-the-technical-definition-of-sprite-batching" target="_blank">http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/32910/what-is-the-technical-definition-of-sprite-batching</a> for <a id="id478" class="indexterm"></a>more information.</p><p>Sprites can be animated by putting several frames, each representing a stage of the complete animation, in sequence on a single image, which is called spritesheet<a id="id479" class="indexterm"></a> or<a id="id480" class="indexterm"></a> texture atlas. After importing such an image, it can be set in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window as a multiple sprite, and then we can use that sequence to animate the sprite. This is the topic of our next recipe.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec195"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>If the automatic slicing process doesn't work perfectly when splitting a multiple sprite, it is possible to slice a multiple sprite based on based on a grid defined by the user. This technique works fine when all frames in the multiple sprite are of the same width and height, which was not our case with the walking animation for Mario.
