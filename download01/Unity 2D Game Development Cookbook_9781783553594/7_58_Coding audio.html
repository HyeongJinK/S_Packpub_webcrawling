  Destroy(c.gameObject);
  collected += 1;
  Debug.Log(collected);
}</pre></div><p>If we want the audio clip to be played when the character collides with a collectible, we can apparently put the following line inside the <code class="literal">if()</code> statement:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">c.gameObject.audio.Play();</pre></div><p>Unfortunately, we can't do that! If we did, the collectible game object would be destroyed the very moment it begins playing the sound, and the player would hear nothing.</p><p>This is a common problem, but there are many solutions to overcome it. The solution we provide is a creative way to achieve the result we want, and it involves using another important Unity asset we didn't mention yet.</p></div>
