As a starter, our next recipe shows how to import a package into an already existing project.</p><p>A large number of <a id="id251" class="indexterm"></a>packages, such as the Character Controller package, are provided with Unity and more can be bought from the Asset Store. It's always worth taking a look to see what is available there whenever you need extra stuff for your projects. If you are lucky, you may find what you need for free. Otherwise, you can consider paying for quality stuff and save the time it would take to make it yourself.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec100"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>Have your existing project opened in Unity and be ready to follow our instructions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec101"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Access the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and right-click anywhere.

By flagging any of these components, you can decide what to actually import from a package and what not to import.
