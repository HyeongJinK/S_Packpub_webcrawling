Prefabs are game object templates that can be configured however you like with regard to shape, material, behavior, and anything else you may need. These templates can then be saved in your project. Whenever you need that prefab in the game scene at runtime, you can use a function called <code class="literal">Instantiate()</code> that<a id="id291" class="indexterm"></a> takes a prefab as a parameter and puts it in the game. The following recipe shows how to create Prefabs in Unity.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec119"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>Start a new scene in your project and follow the instructions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec120"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><p>To make a prefab you first need to create a <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. Once you put everything you need into the GameObject, you can save it as a prefab.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Create a new <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in the scene, <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>. You should know by now how to do it.</p></li><li><p>Add the material called checker to <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> by dragging the material from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel onto the object in the scene or into the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> slot in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> (with the cube selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>). You can refer to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_05_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> <a id="id292" class="indexterm"></a>folder of your project, create a new folder and name it <code class="literal">Prefabs</code>. Creating a folder is like creating any other type of asset: right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder and from the menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span> under <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> folder and right-click on it to create a new Prefab, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_05_50.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Name the <a id="id293" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> <code class="literal">back_prefab.</code></p></li><li><p>Check whether the cube in the scene is at the 0,0,0 position and with 0,0,0 rotation; then, drag it from <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> into <code class="literal">back_prefab</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, as shown in the following screenshot. If you did things right, the small square icon of <code class="literal">back_prefab</code> should turn from gray to light blue.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_05_51.jpg" /></div></li><li><p><code class="literal">back_prefab</code> is now <a id="id294" class="indexterm"></a>ready to be instantiated at will in our game level. You can delete the cube from the scene, as we don't need it anymore and in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, check whether <code class="literal">back_prefab</code> is actually a cube with a checkered material, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_05_52.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec121"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>The procedure to <a id="id295" class="indexterm"></a>make prefabs is always the same, regardless of the actual characteristics of the game asset itself: create a game object in the scene, add anything you want/need/like to it to define its graphic aspect and behavior, then drag the game object onto a prefab and delete the game object from the scene. Voil√†!</p><p>The prefab to be used for the background is ready, so we now need to script its behavior to use it for the prototype. This is what we will do in the next recipe.</p></div></div>
