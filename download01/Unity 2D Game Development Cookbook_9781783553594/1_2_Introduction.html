Before importing the models, you should take care of bringing in the textures. Feel free to switch between <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a> and <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>2D Assets for Unity</em></span>, which focuses on textures and materials. A cookbook is specifically designed to leave the readers free to access the contents in whichever order they prefer.</p><p>We assume that you have the assets to test the operations explained throughout this book; in case you don't, you can download the contents available on Packt Publishing website.</p><p>When importing models from a 3D software into Unity, there are several settings to be defined: scales, source materials and textures, rigging and animations, and many others. We will discuss the most important setting soon.</p><p>For the importing process to be fully successful, it is also important that the scene in the 3D editor is properly set. When modeling stuff with a 3D editor for a 3D engine, it is important that scales, lights (if available), and cameras match between the scenes, or your models won't fit the game levels properly.</p><p>For the recipes of this chapter, we decided to pick Maya as our reference 3D editor. We do not mean that Maya<a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a> is the best software, but there are plenty of reasons for this choice. Native Maya files are supported by Unity, and the LT version of Maya allows you to perform "one-click-exporting" of<a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a> Maya scenes directly into Unity (<a class="ulink" href="http://videos.autodesk.com/zencoder/content/dam/autodesk/www/products/autodesk-maya-lt/video/send-to-unity-fbx-export-video-1280x720.mp4" target="_blank">http://videos.autodesk.com/zencoder/content/dam/autodesk/www/products/autodesk-maya-lt/video/send-to-unity-fbx-export-video-1280x720.mp4</a>).</p><p>Maya is also an industry standard for 3D artists, and it is supported by both Windows and OS X (while 3D Studio Max, for example, isn't). You can check out 3D forums to delve into the differences between 3D software.
