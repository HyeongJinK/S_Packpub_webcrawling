Since<a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a> we are not importing animations with an FBX file, unflag the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> option entirely. This action will disengage all the following properties (see that they are barred in the following screenshot).</p></li><li><p>Unflag <span class="strong"><strong>Cameras</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Lights</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Embed Media</strong></span>; we don't need any of them either.</p></li><li><p>Flag <span class="strong"><strong>Input Connections</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Connections</strong></span> tab.

What we offered here was a basic outline that will do for most cases. It is very likely that, depending on the specific need that would rise with your own project, you may need to use different settings on specific tabs. In such cases, we suggest you to refer to the official Unity documentation, where an entire section dedicated to exporting from Maya is available.</p><p>Anyway, at some point, you will have determined the optimal settings configuration for your project and won't need to reset them every time. Once you get your optimal configuration, the only change will be with regard to the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> tab. Don't worry about it now; we'll get to importing animations soon.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec31"></a>There's more...</h3></div></div></div><p>If you check <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>Unity's reference manuals (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-ImportObjectMaya.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-ImportObjectMaya.html</a>), you may learn that Unity actually imports native Maya files, which means you can directly open Maya scenes (<code class="literal">*.mb</code> and <code class="literal">*.ma</code> files) in Unity. You can therefore ask, Why export FBX files into Unity at all?</p><p>There is more than one reason actually; one that is worth $4,000 is that FBX files are far more shareable than native Maya files. For example, to open a Maya scene in Unity, you must have Maya installed or the file won't open. If you expect to exchange files between people on their own PCs, you cannot assume that each one of them will have a Maya license. It will thus be safer to use formats that don't require additional costly software, as is the case with Maya (almost $4,000 per license).</p><p>That said, it is still quite useful to open Maya scenes in Unity. For example, in Unity you can immediately check the result of modifications made on a file in Maya without the need to export an FBX file with each new edit. Also, as already stated, Maya LT is going to export FBX file directly into Unity.</p></div></div>
