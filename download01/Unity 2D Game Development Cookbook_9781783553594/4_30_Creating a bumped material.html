The shader we used for this recipe, for example, takes two textures, the so called diffuse and normal maps. It then interpolates them according to an algorithm and finally produces the result we see on screen: a character model with a suit representing both the basic colors and the effect of light bouncing on its surface.</p><p>If you scroll through the shader options available in the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> panel of Unity Inspector, you can yourself check how many possibilities are available to create different types of materials for your game assets.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec99"></a>See also</h3></div></div></div><p>Materials could cover an entire book of their own as it is a rich topic that deals with image crafting and programming at the same time.</p><p>Moreover, besides the built-in shaders available with Unity, new shaders can be added, bought, or programmed; the best hint we can give is to checkout the manual and forums if you want to delve deeper into materials.

But this is where their similarities endâ€”the two differ under all other aspects, especially with regard to movement, precision, and fluidity.</p><p>Character Controllers<a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a> are excellent for shooters because they provide very responsive controls that don't take physics forces into much consideration, so to say. This is exactly what players require in games that mostly rely on reflexes! Think of any first-person shooter you have played; do you believe a real person could run all the time, strafe in the blink of an eye, or turn around so quickly?</p><p>On the other hand, Rigidbodies work fine, for example, for racing games that usually implement detailed physics models to simulate the actual behavior of vehicles in realistic environments. When you drive in a simulation game, you feel (or at least you should!) that the vehicle behavior is affected by acceleration, direction, vehicle setup, and maybe even the weather conditions, for the most advanced games.</p><p>Character Controllers and Rigidbodies are both valid choices with advantage points and drawbacks, so let's look at a couple of recipes to highlight the actual differences between them.</p><p>The important thing to stress upon is that one is designed for cases while the other is usually not. In other words, using a Rigidbody means you don't want to use a Character Controller, and vice versa!</p></div></div></div>
