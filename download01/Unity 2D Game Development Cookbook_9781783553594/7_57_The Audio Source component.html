This camera is responsible, by default, for displaying the actual game scene when we press the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button in the Unity Editor. Among the components the camera comes attached with by default, there is a component named <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> (you can check it out in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel). This component allows sounds to be heard by the player through the built-in speakers of their device or through a headset.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span><a id="id418" class="indexterm"></a> constitutes the receiving half of the audio system implemented in Unity, the other half (the source half) being another Unity component called <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span>. While the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> is generally attached to the main camera in the scene, <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> is attached to game objects in the scene that emit sounds, be they short sound effects or long, looped background music. In other words, to hear game sounds in Unity, you need to have at least one <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> in the scene and (likely) several Audio Sources with an audio clip linked to them. Let's now see how the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> component is attached to a game object.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec168"></a>Getting ready</h3></div></div></div><p>Open the game scene in Unity.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec169"></a>How to do it...</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Move to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and access the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> <a id="id419" class="indexterm"></a>folder, then drag <span class="strong"><strong>coll_prefab</strong></span> into the game scene.</p></li><li><p>With <span class="strong"><strong>coll_prefab</strong></span> selected in <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span>, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_07_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Ensure that <span class="strong"><strong>coll_prefab</strong></span> is still selected in the scene.

With this option flagged, the clip would be played whenever a collectible is created in the game scene, which is not what we want for now. Instead, our plan is to play the sound effect when the character gets the collectible.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec170"></a>How it works...</h3></div></div></div><p>The audio clip<a id="id421" class="indexterm"></a> dragged into the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> component is now ready to be played on our command.

One of them is <a id="id422" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Audio Filters</strong></span>. This is a feature available only with Unity Pro, and it consists of additional audio components that can be attached to <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span><a id="id423" class="indexterm"></a> to apply special effects to sounds, such as reverberation, chorus, echo, and so on. More details about these<a id="id424" class="indexterm"></a> effects are available at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioEffect.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioEffect.html</a>.</p><p>The other component is the reverb zone. This can be attached to an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span> to define a faraway area where that sound can't be heard, a closer area where the sound is heard according to a gradient based on distance, and a proximity area where the sound is fully audible. To know more about <a id="id425" class="indexterm"></a>Reverb Zones, you can refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioReverbZone.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioReverbZone.html</a>.</p></div></div>
