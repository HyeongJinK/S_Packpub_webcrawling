This chapter is thus dedicated to creating an actual game level for our prototype and the logic to make it work as a side scrolling game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec117"></a>Level design</h3></div></div></div><p>Though we didn't <a id="id287" class="indexterm"></a>discuss a design document for the prototype we are working on, with every new chapter we provided hints about the kind of game we plan to prototype. For those who didn't notice that, we will offer a recap here.</p><p>Our plan is to create a side scrolling running game. The character runs both left and right. There are platforms to jump on and collectible objects to gather. Gathering all collectibles means you beat the level, whereas falling from platforms more than a given number of times gets the player to the Game Over screen.</p><p>The camera displays the character from a side perspective and follows the character as it runs. Controls are standard and quite simple: left and right arrow buttons to move and the spacebar to jump.</p><p>The game has a background that procedurally recreates itself so the character can endlessly run in any direction: the background will always be there! Platforms are also created procedurally with criteria, so the character always has another platform close enough to jump on. The hard part with platforms is to create them so they are reachable by the character, based on its relative position.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec118"></a>Making the background for the prototype</h3></div></div></div><p>We want the <a id="id288" class="indexterm"></a>background elements for the game to be endlessly<a id="id289" class="indexterm"></a> repeatable: for as far as the character can run in a direction, there will always be a piece of background behind it. To achieve that, we designed a background made of three panels: one stays in the middle and is centered on the player; the other two stay on the left and right of the central element. As the player runs, the farther element is replaced ahead of the character and this routine repeats as long as the game session goes on. The following screenshot shows what we mean:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553594/graphics/3594OT_05_60.jpg" /></div><p>The first thing we need is the actual panels; let's see how to make them.</p></div></div>
