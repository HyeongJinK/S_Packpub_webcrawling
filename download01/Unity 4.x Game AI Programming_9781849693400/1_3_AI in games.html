For that we need to understand the fundamental requirement that every <a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a>game must have. The answer should be easy. It is the fun factor. So, what makes a game fun to play? This is the subject of game design, and a good reference is <span class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Game Design</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Jesse Schell</em></span>. Let's attempt to tackle this question without going deep into game design topics. We'll find that a challenging game is indeed fun to play. Let me repeat: it's about making a game challenging. This means the game should not be so difficult that it's impossible for the player to beat the opponent, or too easy to win. Finding the right challenge level is the key to make a game fun to play.</p><p>And that's where the AI kicks in. The role of AI in games is to make it fun by providing challenging opponents to compete, and interesting <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>non-player characters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPCs</strong></span>) that behave realistically inside the game world. So, the objective here is not to replicate the whole thought process of humans or animals, but to make the NPCs seem intelligent by reacting to the changing situations inside the game world in a way that makes sense to the player.</p><p>The reason that we don't want to make the AI system in games so computationally expensive is that the processing power required for AI calculations needs to be shared between other operations such as graphic rendering and physics simulation. Also, don't forget that they are all happening in real time, and it's also really important to achieve a steady framerate throughout the game. There were even attempts to create dedicated processor for AI calculations (AI Seek's Intia Processor). With the ever-increasing processing power, we now have more and more room for AI calculations. However, like all the other disciplines in game development, optimizing AI calculations remains a huge challenge for the AI developers.</p></div>
