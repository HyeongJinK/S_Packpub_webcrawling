We've seen that using a 2D grid (array) for A* path finding on a 2D map. AI agents need to know where the obstacles are, especially the static obstacles. Dealing with collision avoidance between dynamically moving objects is another subject, primarily known as steering behaviors. Unity has a built-in navigation feature to generate a <a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>navigation mesh</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>navmesh</strong></span>) that represents the scene in a context that makes sense for our AI agents to find the optimum path to the target. This chapter comes with a Unity project that has four scenes in it. You should open it in Unity and see how it works to get a feeling of what we are going to build. Using this sample project, we'll study how to create a navmesh, and use it with AI agents inside our own scenes.</p></div>
