<span class="strong"><strong>AICars</strong></span> entity and one player-controlled car entity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>The realistic car model, car movement behaviors and camera scripts were based on the Unity3D Car Tutorial project. You can download and learn more about it at <a class="ulink" href="http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/car-tutorial/" target="_blank">http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/car-tutorial/</a>.</p></div><p>We have also set up waypoints for AI cars to patrol and a flock controller group with the objects as child entities under it. If you want to build a more realistic environment you could add other types of light, and build a <a id="id447" class="indexterm"></a>light map to generate shadows for an offline mode. But in this demo, we'll just use a directional light to simply light up the scene. The <code class="literal">recticle</code> player game <a id="id448" class="indexterm"></a>object is used to reference the target position pointed by the mouse. In addition to static block obstacles we also have dynamic obstacles that are affected by physics and can be destroyed by our weapons. So this is what our little scene looks like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400_10_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>How the scene looks from above</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec55"></a>Tags and layers</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we start scripting there's one important step to set up, which is to configure tags used in our game. Tags and layers <a id="id449" class="indexterm"></a>can be set up through <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tags</strong></span>. We can use either object names or tags when referencing and identifying game objects in the scene from a script using methods like <code class="literal">GameObject.FindWithTag()</code>. <a id="id450" class="indexterm"></a>Layers are <a id="id451" class="indexterm"></a>mostly used while setting a culling mask for cameras to render only the selected parts of the scene, and by lights to illuminate only parts of the scene. In this project, we're using layers to only detect collision between specific layers. We'll see more on that later, when we use them in scripting. For now, just take note that tags and layers are set up as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400_10_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Tags and layers used in our game</p></div></div></div></div>
