Academic AI researches try to solve real-world problems, and prove a theory without much limited resources. Game AI focuses on building NPCs within limited resources that seems to be intelligent to the player. Objective of AI in games is to provide a challenging opponent that makes the game more fun to play with. We also learned briefly about the different AI techniques that are widely used in games such as finite state machines (FSMs), random and probability, sensor and input system, flocking and group behaviors, path following and steering behaviors, AI path finding, navigation mesh generation, and behavior trees. We'll see how to implement these techniques inside the Unity engine in the following chapters.</p></div>
