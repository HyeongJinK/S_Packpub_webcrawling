As we have discussed earlier, a character AI system needs to have awareness of its environment, awareness such as where the obstacles are, where the enemy it's looking for is, if the enemy is visible in the player's sight, and others. The quality of artificial intelligence of our NPCs completely depends on the information it can <a id="id168" class="indexterm"></a>get from the environment. Based on that information, the AI characters will decide which logic to execute. If there's not enough information for the AI, our AI characters can show strange behaviors, such as choosing the wrong places to take cover, idling, and looping strange actions, and not knowing what decision to make. Search for "AI glitches" on YouTube, and you'll find some funny behaviors of AI characters even in AAA games.</p><p>We can detect all the environment parameters and check against our predetermined values if we want. But using a proper design pattern will help us maintain code and thus will be easy to extend. This chapter will introduce such a design pattern that we can use to implement sensory systems. We will be going over what a sensory system is, and how to make such a system in Unity. We will then build a demo where we can see our sensory system in action.</p></div>
