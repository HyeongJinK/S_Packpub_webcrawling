This is the final chapter in our book and we'll apply some of those techniques in a better game example. The techniques we'll be using in this chapter include pathfinding, <a id="id444" class="indexterm"></a>finite-state machines (FSMs) and flocking behavior together with some other generic game features, such as building classes for weapons and ammos. So unlike the other chapters this one should be a bit more fun. First we will create the car. Then we will give it some AI. After that we will outfit our cars with weapons for battle. Let's get started.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll be building a simple vehicular combat game inspired by the popular <span class="emphasis"><em>Twisted Metal</em></span> series on the PlayStation platform. So, of course, there'll be cars and gunfights and explosions, but it will be much simpler in our version. This project after all is still a demo, and we will not be building a complete game with scoring systems, power ups, menu screens, and customization stuff. So in a scaled down version of our vehicular combat game, we'll implement a player-controlled car and an AI class for opponent cars. The player car will be equipped with two different weapons; a normal gun with bullets and a missile launcher that will track down if targeted at an enemy car.</p></div>
