This can in turn affect the <a id="id140" class="indexterm"></a>overall difficulty level of the game, and keep it challenging and interesting enough to players. As described in the book, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Game Design</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Jesse Schell</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Morgan Kaufmann publications</em></span>, players will only continue to play our game if we keep them in their flow channel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400_03_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The Flow Channel</p></div></div><p>The players will feel anxious and get disappointed if we present tough challenges for them to solve before they have the necessary skills. On the other hand, once they've mastered the skills, and if we continue to keep the game at the same pace, then they will get bored. The grey area that can keep the players engaged for a long time is between these two extremes of hard and easy, which the original author referred to as the flow channel. To keep the players in the flow channel, the game designers need to feed the challenges and missions that match with the progressive skills that the players have acquired over time. However, it is not an easy task to find a value that works for all players, since the pace of learning and the <a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a>expectations can be different individually.</p><p>One way to tackle this problem is to collect the player attempts and results during the game-play sessions, and to adjust the probability of the opponent's AI accordingly. Though this approach is supposed to help the games to be more engaging, there are many other players who don't like this approach, since this method takes away the pride and satisfaction of finishing a hard game. After all, beating a very hard boss AI character despite all the challenges can be much more rewarding and satisfying than winning the game because the AI is dumb. They would feel much worse if they find out that the AI becomes dumb because they don't have enough skills to match. So we must be careful about when we want to apply this technique in our games.</p></div>
