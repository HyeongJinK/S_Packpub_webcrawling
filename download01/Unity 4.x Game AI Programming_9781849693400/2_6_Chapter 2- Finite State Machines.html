We'll be dissecting the code and the components in this project.</p><p>In our game, the player will be able to <a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a>control a tank. The enemy tanks will be moving around in the scene with reference to four waypoints. Once the player tank enters their visible range, they will start chasing us; and once they are close enough to attack, they'll start shooting at our player tank. Is this simple enough? We'll implement FSMs to control the AI of our enemy tank. First we'll use simple <code class="literal">switch</code> statements to implement our tank AI states, and then we'll use a FSM framework, which is based on and adapted from the <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>C# FSM framework, and can be found at the following link:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Finite_State_Machine" target="_blank">http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Finite_State_Machine</a></p></div>
