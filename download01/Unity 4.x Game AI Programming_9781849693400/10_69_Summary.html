We would be able to apply some more techniques in a larger game scope, but in this short chapter, we reused the advanced FSM framework that we built in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finite State Machines</em></span>, as well as waypoint and path following techniques. We could also use our sensor system, while detecting the environment for the AI cars. But to make the chapter simpler we just accessed the player's position and checked the distance between the two directly. The AI cars will follow and attack once the player car is near them, even if it's not in their line of sight. So this is one area you can apply in order to make the game better. This is the final chapter of this book, and we hope that you learnt something new in areas related to artificial intelligence in games as well as in Unity3D.</p></div>
