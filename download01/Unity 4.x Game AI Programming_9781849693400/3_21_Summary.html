We experimented with some of the techniques by implementing them in Unity3D. As a bonus, we also learnt about the basics of how a slot machine works, and implemented a simple slot machine game using Unity3D. Probability in game AI is about making the game and characters seem more realistic by adding some uncertainty, so that the players cannot predict something for sure. One of the common usages and definitions of probability is to measure the possibility of a desired event to occur out of all the other possible events. A good reference to further study the advanced techniques on probability in game AI, such as decision making under uncertainty using Bayesian techniques, would be the <span class="emphasis"><em>AI for Game Developers</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>David M.

In the next chapter, we will take a look at implementing sensors, and how they can be used to make our AI aware of its surroundings.</p></div>
