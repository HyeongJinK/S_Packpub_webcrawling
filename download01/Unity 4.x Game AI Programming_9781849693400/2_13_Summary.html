We first looked at how to implement FSM in the simplest way, using the <code class="literal">switch</code> statements. Then we studied how to use a framework to make the AI implementation easier to manage and extend.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at randomness and probability and how we can use it to make the outcome of our games more unpredictable.</p></div>
