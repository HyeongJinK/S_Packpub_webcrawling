The A* pathfinding algorithm is widely used in games and interactive applications even though there are other algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, because of its simplicity and effectiveness. We've briefly covered this algorithm previously in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to AI</em></span>. But let's review the algorithm again from an implementation perspective.</p></div>
