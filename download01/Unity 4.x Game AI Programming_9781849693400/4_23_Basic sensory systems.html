In game AI sensory systems, the agents will have to examine the environment and check for such senses periodically based on their particular interest.</p><p>The concept of a basic sensory system is that there will be two components: <code class="literal">Aspect</code> and <code class="literal">Sense</code>. Our AI characters will have senses, such as perception, smell, and touch. These senses will look out for specific aspects such as enemy and bandit. For example, you could have a patrol guard AI with a perception sense that's looking for other game objects with an enemy aspect. Or it could be a zombie entity with a smell sense looking for other entities with an aspect defined as brain.</p><p>For our demo, this is basically what we are going to implement: a base interface called <code class="literal">Sense</code> that will be implemented by other custom senses. In this chapter, we'll implement perspective and touch senses. Perspective is what animals use to see the world around them. If our AI character sees an enemy, we want to be notified so that we can take some action. Likewise, with Touch, when an enemy gets too close, we want to be able to sense that; almost as if our AI character <a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a>can hear that the enemy is nearby. Then we'll write a minimal <code class="literal">Aspect</code> class that our senses will be looking for.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>RAIN{ONE} is an AI plugin for Unity3D that supports such a sensory system with not much coding required.</p></div><p>The following quote on <a id="id172" class="indexterm"></a>RAIN has been taken from <a class="ulink" href="http://rivaltheory.com/product" target="_blank">http://rivaltheory.com/product</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>RAIN raises the bar for AI in Unity by giving in-game characters the ability to sense the world, pathfind, execute sophisticated behavior trees, and modify actions based on personality traits.
