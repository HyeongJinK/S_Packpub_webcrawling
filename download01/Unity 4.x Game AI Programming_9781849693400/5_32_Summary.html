First we examined, dissected, and learned how to implement a flocking algorithm based on Unity3D's Tropical Island Demo project. Next, we implemented using rigid body to control the boid's movement and sphere collider to avoid collision with other boids. We applied our flocking behavior to the flying objects, but you can apply the techniques in those examples to implement other character behaviors such as fish shoaling, insects swarming, or land animals herding. You'll only have to implement different leader movement behaviors such as limiting movement along the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis for characters that can't move up and down. For a 2D game, we would just freeze the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> position. For 2D movement along uneven terrain, we would have to modify our script to not put any forces in the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> direction.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will go beyond random movement and take a look at path following. We will also be going over how to avoid obstacles that are in your way.</p></div>
