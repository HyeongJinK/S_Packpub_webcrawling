This chapter will be more about generic game AI development techniques in random and probability topics, and less about Unity3D in particular. Moreover, they can be applied to any game development middleware or technology framework. We'll be using mono C# in Unity3D for the demos mainly using the console to output data, and won't address much about the specific features of the Unity3D engine and the editor itself.</p><p>Game developers use probability or the confidence factor to add a little uncertainty to the behaviors of AI characters, as well as to the game world. This makes the artificial intelligence system a bit unpredictable of a certain outcome, and can provide the players with a more exciting and challenging experience.</p><p>Let us take an example of a typical soccer <a id="id111" class="indexterm"></a>game. One of the rules of a soccer game is to award a direct free kick if one player is fouled while trying to possess the ball from the opposing team. Now, instead of giving a foul and a free kick all the time whenever that foul happens, the game developer can apply a probability so that only 98 percent of all the fouls will be rewarded with a direct free kick. As a result, most of the time, the player will get a direct free kick. But when that remaining two percent happens, like you have hit the other player and you know it's going to be a free kick but the referee passes it, it can provide a certain emotional feedback to the players from both the teams (assuming that you are playing against another human). The other player would feel angry and disappointed, while you'd feel lucky and satisfied. In the end, the referees are human, and like all other humans, they might not be 100 percent correct all the time.</p><p>So we use probability in a game AI to make the game and characters livelier and seem more realistic, by not making the same decision or taking the same action again and again. There are many topics to discuss and debate in the probability domain. So this small single chapter will only be able to address the basic concepts, and how we can implement some of them in Unity3D.</p><p>In this chapter, we will be going over random and probability. We will be creating a simple dice game. We will also give some application examples of probability and dynamic AI. Finally, we will finish the chapter with a simple slot machine, and then add on more probability features.</p></div>
