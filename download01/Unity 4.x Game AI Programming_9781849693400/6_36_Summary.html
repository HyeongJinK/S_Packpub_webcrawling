We learned about the Unity3D layer feature and how to selectively raycast against a particular layer. Although the samples were simple, we can apply those simple techniques in various scenarios. For instance, we can set up a path along a road, and by using some vehicle models combined with obstacle avoidance behavior, we can easily set up a decent traffic simulation. Or you can just replace them with biped characters and build crowd simulation. You can also combine them with some finite states to add some more behaviors to make them more intelligent. This simple obstacle avoidance behavior that was implemented in this chapter doesn't consider the optimal path to reach the target position. Instead, it just goes straight to that target, and only if an obstacle is seen within a particular distance does it try to avoid it. It's supposed to be used among moving or dynamic objects and obstacles.</p><p>In the following chapter, we'll study how to implement a pathfinding algorithm called A* to determine the optimal path before moving, while avoiding static obstacles.</p></div>
