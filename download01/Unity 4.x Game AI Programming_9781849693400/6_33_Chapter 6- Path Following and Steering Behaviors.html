In the first example, we'll set up a scene with a path and will write some script to make an entity follow this path. In the second example, we'll set up a scene with a couple of obstacles and program an entity to achieve a target while avoiding the obstacles. Obstacle avoidance is a simple behavior for the AI entities to reach a target point. It's important to note that the specific behavior implemented in this chapter is meant to use for behaviors, such as crowd simulation, where the main objective of each agent entity is just to avoid the other agents and reach the target. There's no consideration on what would be the most efficient and shortest path. We'll learn about the A* pathfinding algorithm in the next chapter.</p></div>
