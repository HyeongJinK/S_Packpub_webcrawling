We studied how to set up different navigation layers with different costs for path finding. We used the <span class="strong"><strong>Nav Mesh Agent</strong></span> component to easily find the path and move toward the target using the <code class="literal">destination</code> property. We set up Off Mesh Links to connect the gaps between the navigation meshes using both the autogeneration feature and manual set up with the Off Mesh Link component. With all this information, we can now easily create simple games with fairly complicated AI. For example, you can try to set the destination property of AI tanks to the player's tank's position and make them follow it. And, using simple FSMs, they can start attacking the player once they reach a certain distance. Our FSM has taken us far, but it has its limits. In the next chapter, we will learn about Behavior Trees, and how they can be used to make AI decisions in even the most complex of games.</p></div>
