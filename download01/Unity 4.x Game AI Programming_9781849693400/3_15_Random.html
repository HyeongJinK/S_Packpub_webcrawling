So speaking of probability, one can't neglect the importance of <a id="id113" class="indexterm"></a>randomness. <span class="strong"><strong>Random number generation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>RNG</strong></span>) is very <a id="id114" class="indexterm"></a>important when we need to produce unpredictable results. The simplest and probably the oldest technique would be throwing a dice to generate a random value between one and six. The random numbers are produced computationally by a <span class="strong"><strong>pseudorandom number generator</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PRNG</strong></span>), and they determine the same sequence of random numbers <a id="id115" class="indexterm"></a>based on the initial seed value. So, if we theoretically know the seed value, we can regenerate the same sequence of random numbers again, and thus they are not considered as truly random. The seed value is usually generated from the state of the computer system, such as the elapsed time in milliseconds since the computer starts running. Some RNGs are more random than others. If we were creating an encryption program, we would want to look into a more random RNG. For the games we will be making, the <a id="id116" class="indexterm"></a>RNG that comes with Unity will suffice. Now let's see how we can generate random numbers in Unity3D.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec28"></a>Random class</h3></div></div></div><p>The Unity3D script has a <code class="literal">Random</code> <a id="id117" class="indexterm"></a>class to generate random data. Two of the most widely used properties would be <code class="literal">seed</code> and <code class="literal">value</code>:</p><p><code class="literal">static var seed : int</code></p><p>You can set this <code class="literal">seed</code> property <a id="id118" class="indexterm"></a>of the <code class="literal">Random</code> class to seed the random number generator. Usually, we will not want to seed the same value again and again, as this will result in the same predictable sequence of random numbers being generated. One of the reasons for keeping the same seed value is for testing purposes:</p><p><code class="literal">static var value : float</code></p><p>You can read the <code class="literal">Random.value</code> <a id="id119" class="indexterm"></a>property to get a random number between <code class="literal">0.0</code> (inclusive) and <code class="literal">1.0</code> (inclusive). Both <code class="literal">0.0</code> and <code class="literal">1.0</code> may be returned by this property. Another class method that could be quite handy is the <code class="literal">Range</code> method.</p><p><code class="literal">static function Range (min : float, max : float) : float</code></p><p>The <code class="literal">Range</code> method can be <a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a>used to generate a random number from a range. When given an <code class="literal">integer value</code>, it returns a random <code class="literal">integer</code> number between <code class="literal">min</code> (inclusive) and <code class="literal">max</code> (exclusive). This means that a zero may be returned, but never a one. If you pass in float values for the range, it'll return a random <code class="literal">float</code> number between <code class="literal">min</code> (inclusive) and <code class="literal">max</code> (inclusive). Take note of the exclusive and inclusive parts. Since the <code class="literal">integer</code> random value is exclusive of <code class="literal">max</code> in range, we'll need to pass in <code class="literal">n+1</code> as the <code class="literal">max</code> range, where <code class="literal">n</code> is our desired maximum random integer. However, for the <code class="literal">float</code> random value, the max value in range is inclusive.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec07"></a>Simple random dice game</h4></div></div></div><p>Let's set up a very simple dice game in a <a id="id121" class="indexterm"></a>new scene, where a random number is being generated between one and six, and checked against the input value.
