We could sit down and tell every object how it should move, <a id="id220" class="indexterm"></a>but that would take a lot of work. Instead, we want to be able to create a flock leader to do that for us. After that, all we need is a few rules and the boids will be flocking all on their own. In this chapter, we'll learn how to do that and implement flocking behavior in Unity3D.</p><p>We'll implement two variations of flocking in this chapter. The first one will be based on a sample flocking behavior found in a demo project called Tropical Paradise Island. This demo came with Unity in Version 2.0, but has been removed since Unity 3.0. The second variation will be based on Craig Reynold's flocking algorithm. There are basically three rules that can be applied to each boid:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Separation</strong></span>: To maintain a distance with other neighbors in the flock to avoid collision</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Alignment</strong></span>: To move in the same direction as the flock, and with the same velocity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Cohesion</strong></span>: To maintain a minimum distance with the flock's center</p></li></ul></div></div>
