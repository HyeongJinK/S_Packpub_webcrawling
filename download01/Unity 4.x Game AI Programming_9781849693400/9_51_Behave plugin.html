It was designed and developed by <span class="emphasis"><em>Emil Johansen</em></span> ("AngryAnt") who's currently working at Unity Technologies. The Behave system comes with a simple and easy to use drag-and-drop logic designer. Game designers can use this interface to set up the behavior logic while the developers implement the real actions. Since it's the easiest toolset to implement behavior trees in Unity3D, we'll be using this system to implement the agents' behaviors in this chapter.</p><p>The following are the steps to be performed for downloading and installing Behave:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>First, let's go and download Behave from Unity Asset Store. Inside Unity3D, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>, and then search for <code class="literal">behave</code>.</p></li><li><p>Once you find <span class="strong"><strong>Behave</strong></span>, click on the arrow beside the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Download and Import</strong></span>. <a id="id391" class="indexterm"></a>This will download the <a id="id392" class="indexterm"></a>Behave system and import it into your currently opened Unity3D project. The latest version of Behave is Version 1.4, and is free. So, we'll be using this version. If you're using an earlier version, there could be minor or major changes and the code may not work out of the box.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400OT_09_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Behave on the Asset Store</p></div></div></li><li><p>Once you've imported Behave into your project you will see a folder called <span class="strong"><strong>Behave</strong></span> in your project directory.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400OT_09_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Behave library imported</p></div></div></li></ol></div><p>You don't really need to worry <a id="id393" class="indexterm"></a>about <a id="id394" class="indexterm"></a>any of the contents of this folder.
