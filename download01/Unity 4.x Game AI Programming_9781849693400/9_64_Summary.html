There are six basic components you can use in Behave behavior tree; action, decorator, parallel, selector, priority selector, and sequence. Each has its own purpose and we briefly covered each of them with respective samples. Lastly here are a few things to remember while using Behave. You have to rebuild your library whenever you make changes to the trees so that the changes are also reflected in compiled code library. If your tree is not getting any ticks, you should check the frequency of your tree and make sure it's not set to zero. You need to make sure that you're instantiating the correct tree type that you want to use in your <code class="literal">InstantiateTree</code> statement. This chapter should be sufficient for you to get started using behavior trees in your game. In the next chapter, we will pull from what we have learned into building one final project.</p></div>
