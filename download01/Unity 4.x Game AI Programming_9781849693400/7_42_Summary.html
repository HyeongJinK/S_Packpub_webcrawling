We implemented our own A* pathfinding class as well as our own grid class, queue class, and node class. We learnt about the <code class="literal">IComparable</code> interface and overriding the <code class="literal">CompareTo</code> method. We used debug draw functionalities to visualize the grid and path formation. With Unity3D's navmesh and navagent features it may not be necessary for you to implement this pathfinding algorithm on your own. Nonetheless, it helps you to understand the underlying algorithm behind the implementation.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at how to extend the idea behind A* and look at navigation meshes. With navigation meshes, it will be much easier for us to find a path over uneven terrain.</p></div>
