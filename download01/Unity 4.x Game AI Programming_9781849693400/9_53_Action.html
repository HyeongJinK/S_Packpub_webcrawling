Let's create a new action by dragging the action node into the Behave editor. Then link it up with the root node by clicking and dragging the root node until the link hooks into the top box of the action node. With the action node selected, rename the action from the Inspector to <span class="strong"><strong>MyAction</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot. This setup basically tells the Behave system that this behavior tree will execute this action a fixed number of times in a second (as provided in the <span class="strong"><strong>Frequency</strong></span> variable of the node property). Make sure you set the frequency value to something besides zero, so that the functions we create later will actually be called. You can also find additional class reference information inside the property inspector panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400OT_09_15.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Action node properties</p></div></div><p>If you set up the action node properties <a id="id399" class="indexterm"></a>accordingly, your tree diagram should look something, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849693400/graphics/3400OT_09_14.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>An action node</p></div></div></div>
