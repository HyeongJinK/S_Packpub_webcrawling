<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec27"></a>Overview of standard Unity classes</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>While I am not going to copy the<a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a> whole Unity Script Reference into this chapter of the book, I would like to list a few important classes and functions that you are going to use quite often.</p><p>The most obvious and frequently used standard functions are <code class="literal">Awake</code>, <code class="literal">Start</code>, <code class="literal">OnEnable</code>, <code class="literal">OnDisable</code>, <code class="literal">Update</code>, and <code class="literal">FixedUpdate</code>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Awake</code> is the first <a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>function that is called when a scene is loaded. The <code class="literal">Awake</code> function can happen only once per scene load. It is generally a good idea to put all initialization code into the <code class="literal">Awake</code> function.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Start</code> happens after <code class="literal">Awake</code> and also runs once. Sometimes it is a good idea to put some code into <code class="literal">Awake</code> and some other code into <code class="literal">Start</code><a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a> in order to make sure that one is executed after the other. When you have an <code class="literal">Awake</code> function in one script and another <code class="literal">Awake</code> function in another script, you cannot be sure which one will be executed first. If the order matters, put one of the pieces of code into the <code class="literal">Start</code> function.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"></a>Tip</h3><p>There's another way to ensure a correct script execution order. You can decide which script is executed before or after by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Script Execution Order</strong></span> from the main menu and then pressing the plus button in the Inspector, selecting the script whose execution order you would like to define, and then dragging it up or down in the interface. You will notice that the number on the right changes as you drag the script: this number is the script's execution order. You give the script its default execution order by removing it from this list. You can do this by pressing the minus button on the right from its name in the list.</p></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <code class="literal">OnEnable</code> function<a id="id125" class="indexterm"></a> is a lot like <code class="literal">Start</code>, except it is called every time the object to which the script is attached is activated, as well as every time the component itself is enabled.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">OnDisable</code> is the <a id="id126" class="indexterm"></a>opposite of <code class="literal">OnEnable</code>. It is called when the object or the component gets disabled.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">Update</code> is called every <a id="id127" class="indexterm"></a>frame. Most of the games' logic usually happens here.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="literal">FixedUpdate</code> is called on<a id="id128" class="indexterm"></a> physics update, which is generally significantly more frequent than <code class="literal">Update</code>. All the code that cannot be frame rate dependent (such as, for instance, movement) should be in the <code class="literal">FixedUpdate</code> function.</p></li></ul></div><p>Apart from the <a id="id129" class="indexterm"></a>functions, there are whole classes with their methods and variables that you should absolutely know about when programming in Unity. It is hard to emphasize something in particular, and you really should just go through all the major classes listed in the Scripting Reference (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/</a>). There are really a lot of classes, and there is hardly anyone who knows what all of them do, but we are going to go through a few that you should look at first thing: <code class="literal">Mathf</code>, <code class="literal">Vector3</code>, <code class="literal">Color</code>, <code class="literal">Input</code>, <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, <code class="literal">Transform</code>, <code class="literal">Renderer</code>, <code class="literal">Material</code>, <code class="literal">Collision</code>, <code class="literal">Collider</code>, and of course <code class="literal">Object</code>, <code class="literal">Behaviour</code>, <code class="literal">Component</code>, and <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>.</p><p>The last four classes are especially important, since they include things that you are going to use every time you write a script in Unity, including functions like <code class="literal">Update</code>, <code class="literal">Destroy</code>, <code class="literal">GetComponent</code>, and <code class="literal">Start</code>, as well as variables such as <code class="literal">enabled</code>, <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">layer</code>, and <code class="literal">tag</code>. Try to read descriptions of these classes and their functions and variables very carefully, and look at the basic examples the documentation offers with them.</p></div>
