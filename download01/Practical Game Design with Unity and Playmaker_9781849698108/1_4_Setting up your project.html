We are not going to discuss this just yet, as the user interface is examined in more detail in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, but you should know that there is nothing to be surprised about if the user interface changes when you install a new extension, such as Playmaker. You can also drag different tabs around and see which layout fits your screen size/configuration and project best. Now we are going to set up the interface in a way that will simplify the explanations in the next couple of chapters. Once you are comfortable with the interface, you can feel free to customize it however you want.</p><p>If you haven't dragged anything around, you should be seeing the default Unity layout. If you have, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Layouts</strong></span> in the main menu and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span> in order to reset to the default window layout. You will see a tab called <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> on the left, <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> in the middle, <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> on the right, and <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> on the bottom. We will talk more about these tabs and their functions in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>. Right now, in order to save screen space, we will drag some of them around and change their appearance.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a>default interface layout<a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a> in Unity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_07.jpg" /></div><p>Let us start with the<a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a> Project tab that you can see on the bottom of the screen. If it is not highlighted, click on the word <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>. Right now both <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tabs are pinned to the bottom of the screen, so you can switch between them in order to select one or the other. Unfortunately, this layout is not ideal, as in most cases you will need direct access to both <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tabs at the same time. Click and drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tabs, until it snaps into place next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. It will become tall and narrow.</p><p>Unfortunately, now there's very little space in the Project panel with those large icons. Luckily, Unity allows us to solve this problem easily by clicking on the small options icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_08.jpg" /></span>) in the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>One Column Layout</strong></span> from the list.</p><p>Now your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel will need much less space, and you will be able to see all of your project's file structure without getting frustrated over icons and sub-panels getting in your way.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"></a>Tip</h3><p>It is important to note here that some developers do prefer the <span class="strong"><strong>Two Column Layout</strong></span> for its <span class="strong"><strong>Favorites</strong></span> section and file manager-like subfolder representation; however, you will most likely want to have as much free work space as you can get, especially when working with plugins like Playmaker that add additional tabs that you need to have constant access to. You should consider the <span class="strong"><strong>Two Column Layout</strong></span> only if you have a relatively big screen.</p></div><p>Now that the <a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel is set up and in place, let us free some more space for the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel by moving the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel under <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>. To do this, click and drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab as you did with the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, and move it to the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> panels until it snaps into place directly under them.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_09.jpg" /></div><p>The following screenshot shows what your editor window should look like if you followed all of the instructions in this chapter correctly.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_10.jpg" /></div><p>Finally, your work <a id="id23" class="indexterm"></a>space is all set! Now it is time to change the project settings. It is a good idea to do this before you start working in order to get this out of the way, so let us get to it. We will not go into much detail about why certain project settings are set in a certain way, and most of them are quite self-explanatory.</p><p>First, select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> from the main menu. A new menu should appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel on the right. You can put your name or the name of your company in the <span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span> field near the top of the menu, and <span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span> (just below it) by default should be the same as the name of your project folder that you specified while creating the project. Changing the project name will not rename your project folder. In fact, everything you change in the Player settings only affects the output game or application. We are going to be building a Unity WebPlayer project for this book's examples, so click on the tab with a little planet icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_11.jpg" /></span>).</p><p>There are only two things here that we are interested in right now: screen resolution and WebPlayer template. Make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Screen Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> are set to <code class="literal">960</code> and <code class="literal">600,</code> respectively, and the active template is <span class="strong"><strong>No Context Menu</strong></span>. There are more options here, but we are going to leave them at their default values for now.</p><p>Next, we will change the build settings to match our target platform. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settingsâ€¦</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>WebPlayer</strong></span> from the list of available platforms (it should be the topmost item on the list). Then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button (as shown in the following screenshot). This will allow you to test the game directly with the output resolution. Once Unity finishes reimporting files, you can close the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_12.jpg" /></div></div>
