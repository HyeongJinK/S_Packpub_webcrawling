Editor is everything you see when you open Unity: panels, views, controls, and so on. <span class="emphasis"><em>Editor</em></span> is how Unity itself is called within Unity. Let us take a look at the main interface elements.</p><p>There is the main menu<a id="id27" class="indexterm"></a> on the top <a id="id28" class="indexterm"></a>of the screen.

They will help you create game objects (for example, primitives, lights, and cameras), attach components, and open new panels and views. The submenus can be explained as follows:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col align="left" /><col align="left" /></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " align="left" valign="bottom">

<p>This<a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a> submenu contains all the commands about building, saving, and opening projects and scenes. There are three commands here that you will use quite often, so it is a good idea to remember hotkeys for them: <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> in Windows) to save the current scene, <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> in Windows) to create a new scene, and <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> in Windows) to open the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window.</p>

<p><span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span></p>
</td><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id31" class="indexterm"></a>submenu lets you create, import, and export files, also known as assets using the game development term. These can be scripts, animations, shaders, materials, and so on. The list of assets that are currently in your project can be seen in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. You will use commands available through this submenu later on in this chapter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span></p>
</td><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p>This submenu lets you create new game objects. Not unlike the way the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> submenu is linked to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> submenu is linked to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. You will learn more about different types of game objects later when we talk about the panels and views in Unity. For now just remember that you can create a new empty game object by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> in Windows).

</td></tr><tr><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span></p>
</td><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id32" class="indexterm"></a>submenu lets you add new components to your game objects. This is very important, because an empty game object does not do anything, and it is invisible. By adding components to it, you can change its appearance and behavior. We will talk about components in more detail in the next chapter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>PlayMaker</strong></span></p>
</td><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id33" class="indexterm"></a>submenu is not a default Unity submenu; it was added to the main menu by the Playmaker plugin that you imported from the Asset Store. This Playmaker-dedicated submenu lets you access Playmaker components and panels, such as the FSM view and its panel that allow you to choose new actions and transitions for your objects. We will look at Playmaker later on in this and the following chapters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span></p>

<p>This <a id="id34" class="indexterm"></a>submenu lets you open new panels and views, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Scene</strong></span>. This submenu is useful if you have lost or accidentally closed one of your panels or views and want to find or open it again. It doesn't allow you to open multiple instances of the same interface elements, so you will always find the existing panel if it is open already.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p><span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span></p>
</td><td style="" align="left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>submenu allows you to access <a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a>useful Unity reference resources, such as Unity Manual, Reference Material, and Scripting Reference. There are copies of these available on the web, but it is always a good idea to use the ones provided with your installation: this way you are making sure that the documentation you are using is consistent with your version of Unity, plus the local copy of the documentation always works faster. The <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> submenu also provides shortcuts to Unity's community sites, such as forum, answers, and feedback, and lets you report bugs and check for updates.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now, below the main menu is the toolbar that includes (left to right) main controls for the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, game execution controls, and drop-down boxes of layer filter and layout selection.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_01.jpg" /></div><p>Under the<a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a> toolbar you will see the panel and the view tabs. We will look at them closer later in this chapter, but for now you just need to know that there is a distinction between views that include <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> and panels that include <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Panels and views can all be manipulated, resized, detached, and attached in the same way, but the difference between them is that views (as the name suggests) let you see your game scene in one way or another, while panels provide additional information and tools for game objects, the scene, or the project as a whole.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"></a>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that the distinction between views and panels is merely a helpful convention and by no means limits the functionality of a tab. This is especially true of custom tabs added by various plugins or, indeed, by yourself. In this book this distinction is made for convenience.</p></div><p>The following figure shows what your Editor window is supposed to look like if you haven't moved any tabs around since <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em></span>. We will be referring to this layout throughout this chapter, so if your layout differs, I suggest you change it to match the image. You can always go back to it later.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>On the very <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>bottom of the Unity Editor window there is a long empty gray line. This is the status bar: it shows the last thing displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel, and clicking on it reveals the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>, highlighting the last log message in it. The status bar, the main menu, and the toolbar are all permanent interface elements in Unity and, unlike the tabs, cannot be closed, detached, or resized without manipulating the Editor window itself.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec06"></a>Hierarchy panel</h3></div></div></div><p>A panel in Unity is a<a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a> tab that provides information about or gives you additional <a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a>control over a game object, a scene, or the project as a whole. Panels can be added, closed, detached, and attached at will. You can drag them around as you see fit in order to optimize your workflow. If you followed the instructions in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em></span>, your current layout should match that of the last screenshot in the previous section of this chapter.</p><p>To begin, let us look at the Hierarchy panel (you should have it attached on the left of the Editor window).</p><p>The place where you see the word <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> written is the tab's header. You can drag any tab by its header, be it a view or a panel. Any number of panels can be present in any position in the Editor, so sometimes you will have a situation when you have multiple tabs attached to the same area of the screen (as on the following figure):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_03.jpg" /></div><p>Let us try to reproduce this situation. Click the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_04.jpg" /></span>) button in the top-right corner of the Hierarchy panel. Then hover the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tab</strong></span> option from the drop-down list and, finally, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. Now you should have two <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panels attached to the same side of the screen. Their headers should be next to each other: one of them active, and the other one inactive. The active panel is the one that has a lighter color.</p><p>The following figure<a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a> shows the menu that allows you to add new tabs to a <a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>certain area of the screen; in this case it is on the right, in the same place where the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel is. Use it to add another <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_05.jpg" /></div><p>Click on the inactive panel's header to see its contents. At this point you should see that both panels look exactly the same: the only thing inside both is <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>. This is because both panels show the contents of the same scene. You can have as many <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panels as you want, but they will all show exactly the same thing. We don't need two of them, so let us close one: right click on one of the Hierarchy tabs' headers and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Close Tab</strong></span> from the contextual menu that appears. Note that this is the same menu that appears when you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> button in the top-right corner of the panel. This is just another way of doing the same thing.</p><p>I have just mentioned something called scene and a scene's contents—but what does it mean? A project in Unity is composed of scenes; think of them as level files if you like, except apart from the actual game levels, scenes can contain things like intro cinematics, loading screens, game menus, or anything. This is just a convenient way of dividing your game into manageable chunks, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel reveals everything that is inside of the currently open scene. You can have only one scene open at any given moment, which is why no matter how many <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panels you open, they will all show the same exact thing. We will talk about scenes in more detail in the next chapter.</p><p>Another thing that you should notice is the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button in the top-left corner of the panel just below the header. Click on it, and you will see the same menu that you would see if you navigated to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Other</strong></span> from the main menu. This menu allows you to create game objects that are added to the current scene when you click on their names in the list.</p><p>A game object in Unity is kind of a shell, a container that can be anything: a cube, a light, a camera, or a character. Go ahead and create a cube, a quad, and a directional light. We will use these in the following chapters to create a game.</p><p>Now that we have <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>all these game objects, we want to position them in<a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a> a certain way in the scene. To do this, we are going to use the Inspector panel, among other things.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec07"></a>Inspector panel</h3></div></div></div><p>The main purpose of the <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel is performing various actions on game <a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a>objects, including changing their properties, such as appearance, behavior, position, size, and rotation. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> game object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel by clicking on it once. The appearance of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel should now change to include a number of things displayed in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_07.jpg" /></div><p>The first thing that you<a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a> should notice is the small padlock (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_08.jpg" /></span>) icon in the top-right corner of the panel next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> button. Unlike<a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> shows properties of an object rather than a scene, and, since you can have any number of game objects in your currently active scene at the same time, you can assign different inspectors to always focus on specific objects. Open a new <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab by right-clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> header and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tab</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. Both inspectors will be focused on the cube that you selected in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. Click on the padlock icon in one of the inspectors. This will make this <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> always display the properties of <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>, so, if you select <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, the locked (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_09.jpg" /></span>) Inspector will continue showing the Cube's properties, while the other one will show <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span>. You can verify this by clicking on the headers of the two <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panels that you have opened.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you want to expose the properties of two objects at the same time without having to click on the headers, you can detach one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panels by clicking and dragging its header wherever you want that panel to be. This can be helpful if you want to copy components or properties from one object to another or if you want to keep one important object always on display.</p></div><p>Make sure you are <a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a>comfortable with the idea of having multiple inspectors and the <a id="id50" class="indexterm"></a>fact that they correspond to the selected game object. Also note that an <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel can expose properties of multiple game objects at the same time. You can select multiple game objects in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel by pressing and holding <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> in Windows). You can also press <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> and select a range of game objects. These operations are similar to those you would perform in Finder (or Windows Explorer). Try doing this a few times until you are comfortable performing these actions in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and always take note of how the contents of the unlocked <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel change based on the game objects that you select. Once you feel like you have experimented enough, close the locked <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> by right-clicking its header and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Close Tab</strong></span> from the contextual menu.</p><p>Just below the header in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel is the name of the selected game object. You can change it however you want. For now, let us rename our <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> <code class="literal">Wall</code>. Make sure that you have <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> selected in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and that its properties are displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. Click within the text field where you see <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> written at the moment, delete everything, and type <code class="literal">Wall</code>, then press <span class="emphasis"><em>return</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>). You will notice that the name has changed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel as well.</p><p>Below the name field there is a long section with various components separated by black horizontal lines. A default cube (now called <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span>) has <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Filter</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider,</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> components. We will closely examine the components in the next chapter. For now you should focus on the Transform component (shown in the following image along with the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel header), which is the only component that every game object in Unity has.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_10.jpg" /></div><p>Transform <a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a>defines position, rotation, and scale of a game object in 3D space. These <a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a>are all its properties. Set the position of <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>) by clicking in the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> fields, deleting everything in there, entering the value you want instead, and pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>return</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>) on your keyboard. You have just changed the position property of the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component of the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object. The next chapter will examine properties and components more closely. For now just set the positions and rotations of the game objects you have in the scene to the following values:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col align="left" /><col align="left" /><col align="left" /></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " align="left" valign="bottom">

This way, they will be easier to find when we want to open a specific scene.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec09"></a>Views</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that the <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>Project panel is well-organized and your objects are positioned in the scene, it is time to have a look at the view tabs: <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. The former shows the output of all the cameras, while the latter is your main workspace in Unity. This is where the level design is done. The <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view becomes interactive when you click on the play button in the toolbar (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_13.jpg" /></span>) or use the hotkey <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> in Windows), provided there is some kind of input defined in Playmaker or other components. You can also pause (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_14.jpg" /></span>) the game by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> in Windows). This is how you will test your game later. Right now there are no interactions yet, but we will get to that soon enough.</p><p>Activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view by clicking on its header if it is not active right now. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, select <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> and press <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>. This will focus the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view on <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span>. You should be seeing the cube that you created, with a <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Directional light</strong></span> gizmo below it (it looks like a little sun). A <span class="strong"><strong>gizmo</strong></span><a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a> is generally a 2D element in 3D space that lets you select and/or manipulate objects even if they are not represented in any other way in the scene. A gizmo can also be non-interactive, such as a simple line or a wire cube. These are generally used to reveal position or direction of something otherwise invisible.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_15.jpg" /></div><p>Selecting an<a id="id59" class="indexterm"></a> object and pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> is one way to navigate the 3D space. Another way is using your mouse. You can select different objects directly in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view by clicking on their meshes (3D models) or gizmos. To look around, press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. Zoom in and out by using your scroll wheel. Use middle click to drag the view around. You can also rotate around a point by pressing and holding <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> and clicking the left mouse button and moving your mouse around.</p><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Directional light</strong></span> gizmo and press <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_16.jpg" /></span> in the toolbar. You should see three arrows appear: red, green, and blue. These arrows correspond to the X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, respectively. Clicking and dragging one of the arrows will move the object in space. Move <span class="strong"><strong>Directional light</strong></span> anywhere you want: its position does not matter. What does matter, however, is its rotation.</p><p>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_17.jpg" /></span> in the toolbar. A sphere with colored and white circles will appear around the object. Each colored circle is responsible for the object's rotation around one axis. Once again: red for X, green for Y and blue for Z. When you select your light, you should also see yellow rays coming out of it. This is a gizmo that shows in what direction your <span class="strong"><strong>Directional light</strong></span> is lighting the scene. Rotate <span class="strong"><strong>Directional light</strong></span> in such a way that <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span> appear well-lit, almost white in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view. Do not forget that you can switch between the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> views at any moment to see a preview of what you will see in the game.</p><p>You can also <a id="id60" class="indexterm"></a>switch between the ways your rotation, position, and scale gizmos appear by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Global</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>Local</strong></span> toggle button in the toolbar. The <span class="strong"><strong>Pivot</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>Center</strong></span> toggle button determines where it appears: in the pivot point of the object or in its geometric center.</p><p>Once you are happy with the light, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span> object and press <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_18.jpg" /></span> in the toolbar. This is the scale manipulation mode. If you press <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> to focus on <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span>, you will see a gizmo similar to that of the movement manipulator, but with little colored cubes instead of arrows on the ends of each line. As before, colors correspond to axes: red for X, green for Y, and blue for Z. There is also a white cube in the middle, which is the uniform scale manipulator that allows you to change scale on all three axes at the same time.</p><p>Using this gizmo, scale <span class="strong"><strong>Quad</strong></span> to be about <code class="literal">100</code> on the X and Y axes. Its Z scale should stay the same. You can check the current values of position, rotation, and scale in the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel when you have an object selected.</p><p>Save your scene by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> in Windows).</p></div></div>
