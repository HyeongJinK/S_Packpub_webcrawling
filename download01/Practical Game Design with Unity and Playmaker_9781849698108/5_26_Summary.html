You should try repeating the process described in this chapter with another set of actions on your own. Set yourself a gameplay goal, for instance, you could take one of the exercises offered at the end of <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Your First Game</em></span>, write a JS or C# script that accomplishes the goal; and then translate it into a Playmaker action. You will feel much more comfortable with scripting by the time you are done, as it is all about practice, and no amount of reading and theory can replace a hands-on experience with a text editor and a search engine.</p><p>The next chapters continue talking about advanced subjects, such as networking and external APIs, and we are going to do some more scripting in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with External APIs</em></span>.</p></div>
