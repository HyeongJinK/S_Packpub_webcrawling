Some APIs let you access the JavaScript code of the page your WebPlayer game is on, while others provide a possibility of transferring game data and getting information to remote servers.</p><p>You have already used one API in your air hockey game in the previous chapter: that of Photon Unity Networking. Most of the calls to remote servers are buried deep inside of its source code, but it is nevertheless an API.</p><p>Other APIs that you might encounter include online game platforms, such as Kongregate and Facebook; analytics tools, such as Google Analytics<a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a> and<a id="id170" class="indexterm"></a> Game Analytics; and online data storage platforms, such as Scoreoid<a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a> and<a id="id172" class="indexterm"></a> Steamworks.</p><p>In addition to different functions, APIs use different ways to connect to the external code base and different ways to communicate with it later, which may seem like a hard task, but rarely is. There is generally a comprehensive guide to the API on its website, and even when there is not the Unity community often comes to the rescue, putting together its own guides, template files, and code snippets readily available in Unity answers or forums.</p><p>We are going to <a id="id173" class="indexterm"></a>integrate our game with Kongregate to show how this works and what kind of code you need to use. Kongregate was chosen as a fairly straightforward, very common, and completely free API.</p></div>
