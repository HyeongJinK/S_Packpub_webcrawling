We also need to make a few adjustments to the scene and set up matchmaking.</p><p>We are going to use the Photon Playmaker example as a template for our game, using the scenes from there and modifying them to suit our purposes. This is generally a good idea if you want to set up multiplayer quickly, because these examples feature numerous and complex FSMs that would take quite a lot of time to set up, while most of the things you will need have already been implemented.</p><p>You can download the demo scenes here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.hutonggames.com/samples.php" target="_blank">http://www.hutonggames.com/samples.php</a>. Simply click on the link <span class="strong"><strong>Download PlayMaker Photon Demo</strong></span> (requires Unity 3.5+ Playmaker 1.6.1+). Then you will need to find the downloaded <code class="literal">unitypackage</code> file on your computer and double-click on it. This will prompt the import window. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button in the bottom-right corner of it.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip25"></a>Tip</h3><p>The warning on the example download page advises against importing the example into existing projects. We can ignore this warning, because none of our files are named in the same way the ones in the example are. As a general rule, you should always make sure that this is the case before importing new packages into new empty projects. Otherwise you might find yourself losing important assets in your projects.</p></div><p>Save the <span class="strong"><strong>Multiplayer</strong></span> scene, and let us add the demo scenes to our project. They should be under <code class="literal">Photon Unity Networking/PlayMaker/Demo/Separated Scenes Demo</code>. Open the <span class="strong"><strong>demo_lobby</strong></span> scene by double-clicking on its file.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is add the new scenes to our project. Open <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> in Windows), then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button shown in the following screenshot. This will add the currently open scene to the project. Do this for <span class="strong"><strong>demo_lobby</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>demo_room</strong></span>. Then close <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_06_02.jpg" /></div><p>These two scenes are<a id="id160" class="indexterm"></a> going to be responsible for two states of the game: the matchmaking state where players can find and create servers and the match state where the game itself takes place. You can test how it works by opening two instances of your game at once: one in the Unity Editor, one in your web browser.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>To make a browser build, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build &amp; Run</strong></span> from the main menu and save the build files wherever you want on your computer when the file browser appears.

This should automatically open the game in your browser.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip26"></a>Tip</h3><p>Please note that your platform has to be set to Web Player as described in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em></span>.

This way you can test how networking works by looking at your scene from the points of view of two players.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now that you have <a id="id161" class="indexterm"></a>seen how multiplayer works in the example project, it is time to modify its scenes to work with our game. We are going to keep the matchmaking intact (in fact, it can be kept this way for almost any multiplayer game). The only thing that needs changing is the maximum number of players that can join a single room. You may have noticed that the example project allows for 100 players.

Make sure you always start from the <span class="strong"><strong>demo_lobby</strong></span> scene, because otherwise the matchmaking will not work.</p><p>You will see that the mallets' and the puck's positions are synched over the network. That is, they move simultaneously in both Editor and web browser. You will also notice that the movement of the remote object is somewhat jerky and imprecise (especially the puck on the host's client). This is due to the inevitable network delay and physics data being calculated more often than Photon packages are being sent. At the moment the only real solution to this problem is switching to Unity native networking, which, however, requires that you have your own server if you want the game to work over the Internet.</p><p>The place where the objects' movement is smoothed out is the <span class="strong"><strong>Position synch</strong></span> FSM of <code class="literal">Puck</code> and <code class="literal">Mallet</code> prefabs. If you look at the <span class="strong"><strong>get player position</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Set player position with lerp states</strong></span> of these state machines, you will see that, if the object was first created on the local machine, its position gets saved in a variable every frame and synched over the network. If the object does not belong to the player's client, the variable is read, and then the position of the local copy of the object is interpolated.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip27"></a>Tip</h3><p>You could try changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Amount</strong></span> property of the <span class="strong"><strong>Vector3 Lerp 2</strong></span> action in the <span class="strong"><strong>Set player position with lerp</strong></span> state. This variable determines the precision of the interpolation. If you want to know more about the way PUN works under the hood, make sure you consult its online documentation that explains every state machine in the demo scenes in great detail: <a class="ulink" href="https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W927" target="_blank">https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W927</a></p></div><p>As you can see, <a id="id167" class="indexterm"></a>Photon networking is quite easy to set up, but is not a very good solution for games that require physics simulation. This is mostly due to cloud server limitations and limited integration with the Unity engine. Most simple games that don't rely on physics so heavily can benefit from Photon greatly. In other cases, Unity native networking should be used. More information about it can be found in the Network Reference Guide section of the Unity documentation: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/NetworkReferenceGuide.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/NetworkReferenceGuide.html</a></p><p>Playmaker is capable of working with native Unity networking as well. You can check the <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span> section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> panel for the list of available Playmaker actions and compare them with the actions described in the reference material.</p></div>
