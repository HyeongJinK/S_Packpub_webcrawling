<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"></a>Downloading and installing Unity</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Unity<a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a> is available for both Mac OS X and Windows PC, and the process of installation for these platforms is very similar. This book is going to use the Mac version of Unity, but I will provide you with alternative directions and hotkeys when they are different in the Windows version. Luckily, everything is, in fact, quite similar, and you should not have any problems switching between the two platforms if you choose to do so.</p><p>First things first, let us head over <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>to <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/unity/download/</a> and download the <a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a>latest version of Unity available (as of writing this book the version is 4.3). Just click the blue <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button, and the file should start being downloaded to your hard drive. The file in question will be a DMG file for Mac users or an installer EXE for Windows users. Save it wherever you want on your hard drive.</p><p>If you are on a Mac, double-clicking the DMG file will reveal the PKG file, which is the installer. Double-clicking <code class="literal">Unity.pkg</code> <a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>will produce essentially the same result as double-clicking <code class="literal">Unity.exe</code> in <a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a>Windows—it will prompt the installation wizard. You are not given any Unity-specific <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>options<a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a> except for the location where you want to install the engine.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>You can install multiple versions of Unity on the same computer. To do this, you just have to change the name of the folder in which Unity is being installed and put the new installation into a different folder. You might want to do this if you want to have different versions installed at the same time, either because of license restrictions or because of some version-specific features that you want to access. Keep in mind that if you update a project to a newer version of Unity, you cannot go back to an older one.</p></div><p>The following screenshot shows the installation window of Unity. In this stage of the wizard you can specify the directory where Unity will be installed or change some installation parameters. In most cases you will want to install Unity with the default parameters. If that is the case, simply click on <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> and skip the next step.</p><p>If you want to change the install location, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Change Install Location...</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Customize</strong></span> button lets you include or exclude specific packages, such as the main Unity installation, example project, and Unity Web Player. Leave all of the boxes checked for this installation. We will talk about packages later in the book.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_01.jpg" /></div><p>Clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> will lead to installation of Unity on your hard drive. Once installation is done, you can go to the folder where you installed it (by default, <code class="literal">Applications/Unity</code> on Mac or <code class="literal">C:\\Program Files\Unity</code> in Windows) and launch it.</p><p>If you are<a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a> launching<a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a> Unity for the first time, a window will pop up asking you to select your type of license and enter your Unity account login and password. Do create an account if you do not have one and enter the details. Later you will need it for things like forum access and Unity answers—both very helpful when you are looking for solutions to Unity-related problems. In this book we are going to be using the free version of Unity, since none of the examples here will require any pro-license features. So select <span class="strong"><strong>Activate the free version of Unity</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_02.jpg" /></div><p>The first time you open Unity, a default project will likely be loaded. These test projects included with the installation (and available through Unity's website) will be quite helpful later on when you want to find out how to do some specific thing (for example, mini-map or water physics), but do not know where to start.</p><p>For now, though, we want a new empty project. Once Unity is loaded, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu in the main menu on the top-left corner of the screen and select <span class="strong"><strong>New Project…</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_03.jpg" /></div><p>This will prompt the <a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project Wizard</strong></span> window, in which you can choose where you want your future project to be <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>located, as well as how it will be called. In Unity, a project is a folder, so the name that you give to your project folder will automatically be assigned to the project. For the examples in this book, you will not need any packages at this point, so leave all the checkboxes empty, unless you already have Playmaker downloaded, in which case check Playmaker. When you are ready, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you want to always start from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Wizard</strong></span> (which is highly recommended if you are planning to have multiple projects), go to <span class="strong"><strong>Unity</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> and check <span class="strong"><strong>Always Show Project Wizard</strong></span>, then close the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> window. For Windows users it is <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> instead.</p></div><p>Since we are not loading any heavy asset packages, the project will load really quickly, and you should see the main Unity interface again, except this time everything will be empty.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_04.jpg" /></div></div>
