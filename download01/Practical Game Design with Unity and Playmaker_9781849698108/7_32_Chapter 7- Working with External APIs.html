One way of expanding it would be making more levels and mechanics for it, but you already know how to do that. The other way would be integrating it with different external services, such as analytics, online scoring platforms, and leaderboards.</p><p>In this chapter we are going to talk about <span class="strong"><strong>application programming interfaces</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>APIs</strong></span>). We will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>API—what it is and what it's used for</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Existing useful external APIs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The way Unity typically communicates with external APIs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Integrating a game with one of the existing APIs (Kongregate)</p></li></ul></div><p>We will look at some code snippets that you are going to use to integrate your game with Kongregate, test the game online, and save the number of times the player wins on Kongregate's servers.</p></div>
