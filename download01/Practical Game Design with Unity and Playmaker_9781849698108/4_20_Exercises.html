<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec24"></a>Exercises</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>There are some exercises that I would like to suggest that you try doing before you move on to the next chapters, which cover more advanced topics. You already know the basics of Unity and Playmakerâ€”enough to make your game better or make a completely new one from scratch. Doing these exercises will improve your skills and help consolidate the new information that you have been exposed to in this book. Exercises are sorted by difficulty, from the easiest to the hardest one:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Debug log all the important events in the game, including puck hits, goal hits, and wall collisions for both mallets.</p></li><li><p>Hit sounds: Your <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab has a FSM. Use it to play some sounds when a mallet and/or a puck hits the wall. <a class="ulink" href="http://Freesound.org" target="_blank">Freesound.org</a> is a good resource for free sound effects. If you are more into retro sounds, try <a class="ulink" href="http://bfxr.net" target="_blank">bfxr.net</a>.</p></li><li><p>Multiple levels: Try making multiple levels with obstacles/additional walls in the middle. You can just duplicate them all over the place and then, when the round is over, move on to the next level.</p></li><li><p>By now you have probably encountered a situation where the puck falls off of the table, and you are forced to restart the game using the play button. This is annoying for other players as well! You could try changing the table set up, detecting the puck position, or some other way of fixing this.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip16"></a>Tip</h3><p>When you are working on this, think about the way goal triggers work, or be creative and come up with your own solution.</p></div></li><li><p>You know how to manipulate the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and make new materials for objects, and you also know how to change the size and the projection of the camera. You can make your game much prettier if you come up with a beautiful color scheme and/or camera projection/orientation.</p></li><li><p>By now you have probably started wondering whether mouse controls are the best solution for this game. This is a perfectly valid question, and you should make this decision yourself. You will never know for sure until you try different ones, so take a look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Input</strong></span> category in the <span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>If you manage to implement keyboard controls, why not go a step further and make a level where instead of competing with an AI opponent you could play with your friend or family member while sitting at the same computer?</p></li><li><p>Have a close look at states and actions that control the AI. Try modifying some of the properties there or even replacing actions themselves in order to make the AI more intelligent and life-like. You could try and make the AI alternate its behavior based on the position of the puck by going back to its own goal slot in order to protect it. You can also try and figure out a way to stop the AI from being pushed backwards whenever the player pushes the puck that the AI is trying to push itself.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip17"></a>Tip</h3><p>In order to do this, you will need to add a Playmaker variable to the puck and then use one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Get FSM</strong></span> actions under the <span class="strong"><strong>StateMachine</strong></span> category.</p></div></li><li><p>Introduce a new game mechanic to the game: how about rounds of seven games instead of one? Or power-ups? Or limiting the mallets to their side of the table? You choose, you can do them all if you like.</p></li></ol></div><p>Before you take up any of these challenges, you should know about some of the useful Unity and Playmaker online resources that can help you find answers to some, if not all, of the questions. You can be sure that questions will inevitably appear when you start implementing something on your own.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity answers</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://answers.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">http://answers.unity3d.com/</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity wiki</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">http://wiki.unity3d.com/</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity forum</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">http://forum.unity3d.com/</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity documentation</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/learn/documentation" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/learn/documentation</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Playmaker manual</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/" target="_blank">https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/</a></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Playmaker forums</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://hutonggames.com/playmakerforum/" target="_blank">http://hutonggames.com/playmakerforum/</a></p></li></ul></div><p>On Unity answers and the Unity forums, you should not hesitate to ask questions; the Unity community is very active, and there are chances that your problem will be solved in a matter of minutes. Just make sure you explain it well. But before asking, I strongly advise you to use the search option first, since there is a good chance that most of the problems that you might encounter have already been solved.</p></div>
