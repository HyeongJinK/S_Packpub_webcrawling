To do that, you are going to need a Kongregate account if you do not have one yet.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go to <a class="ulink" href="http://kongregate.com" target="_blank">http://kongregate.com</a> and<a id="id176" class="indexterm"></a> near the top of the page find and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Register</strong></span> link, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_07_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>A registration form should appear, offering you to either connect using Facebook or enter your account information manually. Do that and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Sign Up</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>Now, if you go to the Kongregate main page and hover over the <span class="strong"><strong>GAMES</strong></span> button just under the sign-in block of the website, a submenu should appear, divided into three sections: <span class="strong"><strong>FEATURED</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>CATEGORIES</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>DEVELOPERS</strong></span>. It is the last one that is of interest to us. Find the <span class="strong"><strong>UPLOAD A GAME </strong></span>button there and click on it.</p></li><li><p>Open Unity and make a Web build, like you did to test multiplayer in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Networking and Multiplayer</em></span>; remember where you saved it.</p></li><li><p>On the Kongregate website, you now should have the game information menu. Enter the game's name, category, and description, then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>The next step asks you to choose game files and upload them to Kongregate's server. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Choose File</strong></span> button next to <span class="strong"><strong>Game File</strong></span>, navigate to the folder where you saved your Web build from Unity, select the file with the <code class="literal">unity3d</code> extension, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In the two text fields below, enter the game's resolution (width 960 and height 600).</p></li><li><p>Upload an <a id="id177" class="indexterm"></a>image as an icon. You can test, but<a id="id178" class="indexterm"></a> cannot publish a game that does not have an icon.</p></li><li><p>You can also upload images as screenshots. This is not necessary, and you can do this later.</p></li><li><p>Check <span class="strong"><strong>This game is exclusive to Kongregate</strong></span> if you are not planning to upload the game anywhere else. This will ensure that you get more ad profits for people playing your game.</p></li><li><p>Read the <span class="strong"><strong>License Agreement</strong></span> and check the four checkboxes below it.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Statistics API</strong></span> section is what we are going to be using the Kongregate API for. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add a statistic</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Set <span class="strong"><strong>Statistic Name</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Wins</code> and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Type</strong></span> radio button. This is the statistic type, which determines how the statistic will behave. In our case, we will simply add the player's wins up. If your game had a scoring system, you could create another statistic of <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> type for it.</p></li><li><p>Check <span class="strong"><strong>Display in leaderboards</strong></span> to make sure that the statistic shows up on the game's public page.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>, then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Upload</strong></span> on the bottom of the form.</p></li><li><p>After a short waiting period, the game should show up on your screen, being completely functionally playable. You can test the multiplayer mode to make sure that nothing has changed since you uploaded it to the server.</p></li></ol></div><p>If everything works correctly, we should integrate our <span class="strong"><strong>Wins</strong></span> parameter with the game itself. To do that, we will need to write a couple of scripts.</p></div>
