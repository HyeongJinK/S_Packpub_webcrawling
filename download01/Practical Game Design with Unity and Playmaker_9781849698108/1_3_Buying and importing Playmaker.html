<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"></a>Buying and importing Playmaker</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Before we change anything in the layout of our project, there is one missing component that we have to import, which is <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>Playmaker by Hutong Games<a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hutonggames.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hutonggames.com/</a>)â€”the main tool (apart from Unity itself) that we are going to be using in most of the exercises in this book. To get Playmaker, we are going to use the Asset Store. The latter is an online market place valuable for any Unity developer, allowing us to save a lot of time by importing useful plugins and asset packs made by other users into our own projects. Some of the assets available through the Asset Store are free, but most of them, like Playmaker, are user-made and cost money. You too can make your tools and assets available through the Asset Store. Think of it as a developer-targeted analogue of the iTunes Store or Amazon.</p><p>Although you can access and search the Asset Store<a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a> through a web page (<a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/asset-store/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/asset-store/</a>), it is integrated directly into the engine in its most practical form. To access the <a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a>Asset Store directly from Unity, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> submenu in the main menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> from the list. This will open the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window in Unity (you need to be connected to the Internet to see the content of the store).</p><p>In the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window, there is a search box. Type <code class="literal">Playmaker</code> in there and press <span class="emphasis"><em>return</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>) on your keyboard. When the search results are displayed, click on the first one in the top-left corner of <span class="strong"><strong>Search Results</strong></span>, simply called <span class="strong"><strong>Playmaker,</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_05.jpg" /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window will <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>now display the description of Playmaker, user comments, some <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>screenshots, its price, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Buy</strong></span> button. Click on this <a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a>button, enter your credit card or PayPal details, and complete the purchase as you would do with any other online store or service. After that Unity will offer to import the package. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button and when Playmaker is downloaded, in the import window, leaving all the boxes checked, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> again. This will add the Playmaker files to your new Unity project.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"></a>Tip</h3><p>Another way of installing Playmaker (or any other plugin for that matter) is going to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package...</strong></span>, provided that you already have the <code class="literal">unitypackage</code> file with it on your hard drive.</p></div><p>Playmaker also automatically imports some other popular Unity plugins it depends on: iTween for movement and animation and Photon for networking and multiplayer. We will talk about Photon later in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Networking and Multiplayer</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_01_06.jpg" /></div></div>
