This approach is widely used in software development to make things more reusable and easier to manage.</p><p>Let us talk about the way things are organized in Unity. Some of them have already been mentioned in previous chapters, but I will repeat them briefly so that you can see the game objects, components, and their properties in the larger context.</p><p>First of all, you have a project, which is essentially a folder that contains all of the files and information about your game. Some of the files are called <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a>scenes (think of them as levels). A scene contains a number of game objects that you have added to it. The contents of your scenes are determined by you, and you can have as many of them as you want. You can also make your game switch between different scenes, thus making different sets of game objects active.</p><p>On a smaller scale, you have game objects and components. A game object<a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a> by itself is simply an invisible container that does not do anything. Without adding appropriate components to it, it cannot, for instance, appear in the scene, receive input from the player, or move and interact with other objects. Using components, you can easily assemble powerful game objects while reusing several small parts, each responsible for a simple task or behavior—rendering the game object, handling the input, taking damage, playing an audio effect, and so on—making your game much simpler to develop and manage. Unity relies heavily on this approach, so the better you grasp it, the faster you will get good at it.</p><p>The only <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>component that each and every game object in Unity has attached to it by default is <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>. It lets you define the game object's position, rotation, and scale. Normally, you can attach, detach, and destroy components in any given game object at will, but you cannot remove <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>.</p><p>Each component has a number of properties that you can access and change: these can be integer or floating point numbers, strings of text, textures, scripts, references to game objects or other components. They are used to change the way a certain component behaves, to influence its appearance or interaction. Some of the properties that you have already encountered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, include the position, rotation, and scale properties of the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component. There are others that you have seen, including FSM, that we will talk about later in this chapter.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object with the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Filter</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span> components attached to it. the properties of <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> are displayed. In order to reveal or hide a component's properties you need to left-click on its name or on the small arrow on the left of its icon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>Unity has a number of predefined <a id="id71" class="indexterm"></a>game objects that already have components attached to them, such as cameras, lights, and primitives. You can access them by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create </strong></span>from the main menu. Alternatively, you can create empty game objects by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> in Windows) and attach components to them using the <span class="strong"><strong>Components</strong></span> submenu.</p><p>The following figure shows the project structure that we have discussed. Note that there can be any number of scenes within a single project, any number of game objects within a single scene, any number of components attached to a single game object, and finally, any number of properties within a single component.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_03_02.jpg" /></div><p>One final thing that you need to know about components right now is that you can copy them by right-clicking on the name of the component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Copy Component</strong></span> from the contextual menu shown in the following screenshot. You can also reset the <a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a>properties <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>of the components to their default values, remove components, and move them up or down for your convenience.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_03_03.jpg" /></div><p>The <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>copied <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>component can be pasted by right-clicking any component's name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel and selecting either <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Component As New</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Component Values</strong></span> from the same contextual menu. The difference between these two commands is that the former will add a new component identical to the one that you have copied, while the latter will simply transfer the values of all the properties. These commands become active once you have copied a component.</p></div>
