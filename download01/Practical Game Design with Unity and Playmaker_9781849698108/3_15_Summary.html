We also took a closer look at the Playmaker interface: actions, events, variables, and transitions. You took the first step in creating an air hockey game by implementing a real game mechanicâ€”a mallet that is moved with the mouse and a puck that is pushed when the mallet touches it. In the next chapter, we will add even more game mechanics, explain the ones already implemented in more detail, and try to make the game more fun and pretty.</p></div>
