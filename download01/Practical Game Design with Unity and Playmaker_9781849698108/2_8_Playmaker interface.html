In the main menu, go to <span class="strong"><strong>PlayMaker</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>PlayMaker Editor</strong></span>. A<a id="id62" class="indexterm"></a> welcome window with different Playmaker options and a <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel should appear. Close the welcome window, then attach the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel to the same region of the Editor where you have your <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel as shown in the following screenshot (this should be just below the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> views if you haven't changed anything since <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em></span>).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_19.jpg" /></div><p>The darker area on the left is the FSM view.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"></a>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that the FSM view is called Playmaker Editor in the official Playmaker documentation. In this book we will use a clearer name, <span class="emphasis"><em>FSM view</em></span>, to distinguish between different areas of the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel.</p></div><p>It is here that you <a id="id63" class="indexterm"></a>will edit<a id="id64" class="indexterm"></a> your finite state machines and create state nodes and transitions between them, which we will talk about in more detail in the next chapter. For now, follow the instructions given in the lower-right corner of the FSM view:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel or in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view by clicking on it.</p></li><li><p>Right-click anywhere in the FSM view and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add FSM</strong></span> from the contextual menu that appears to add a finite state machine to the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object. When you do that, note the red icon that appears next to <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. This icon means that the object has a Playmaker FSM component. Also note the Playmaker FSM component that appeared in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>Now you can manipulate FSM to assign various behaviors to <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span>. Read all the tips displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel carefully.</p></li></ol></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"></a>Tip</h3><p>To take a better look at any one of the tabs, including the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Space</em></span> key with your mouse cursor hovering over the tab. Then press space again to minimize. You can do this with any view or panel in the Unity Editor.</p></div><p>On the right side of the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel, there are tabs that display and let you modify different information types, including the FSM as a whole, as well as its states, events, and variables. Click on each tab and examine the tips in grey rectangles explaining the contents of each tab. Once you are done with the tips, you can press the <span class="strong"><strong>Hint</strong></span> toggle button on the bottom of the panel to disable them. You can also do this by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>F1</em></span>. Before you do that, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> button next to it and read the tips there. We will examine the necessary changes to the Playmaker preferences in the next chapter.</p><p>Under the FSM view you should see controls similar to pause/play in the toolbar. These are, in fact, the same buttons, and are there just to make it more convenient for you to control the game when you are working with Playmaker.</p><p>The second most important Playmaker-related panel is the <span class="strong"><strong>Action Browser</strong></span>. You can open it by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>PlayMaker</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Action Browser</strong></span> from the main menu. A part of the <span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> panel is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849698108/graphics/8108OT_02_20.jpg" /></div><p>Drag it by its<a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a> header to the right side of the Editor until it snaps into the same <a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a>area of the screen as <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. This panel shows categories of actions that you have in your Playmaker library. Clicking on one of the categories, for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Camera,</strong></span> will reveal the actions. There is also a search bar near the top of the panel that allows you to access the actions you need faster. When you select an action, for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Screen To World Point</strong></span>, a preview of its parameters appears on the bottom of the panel. It shows what the selected action will look like in the <span class="strong"><strong>State</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel. If you have a Playmaker-enabled object and a state in the FSM view selected, you can add an action to it by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Action To State</strong></span> button in the bottom-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> panel.</p><p>You can press the play button (or use the shortcut <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> Windows) to see that there are no errors and everything is working properly. When you are done, press play again and save the scene.</p></div>
