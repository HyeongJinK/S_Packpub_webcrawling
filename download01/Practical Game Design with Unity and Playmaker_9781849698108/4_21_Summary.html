You now know how to make objects, have them interact, make them respond to input, and even move on their own based on your algorithm. On top of that, you now know the fundamentals of vector geometry that you are going to use in most of the games you will make.</p><p>The next chapter is about programming. You will learn how to code your own Unity component and then make it into a Playmaker action. We will also demonstrate that Playmaker is essentially visual programming that uses logic very similar to that of conventional scripts.</p></div>
