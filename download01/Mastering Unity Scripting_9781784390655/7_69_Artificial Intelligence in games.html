Many of them are profound. However, in video games, it's primarily<a id="id529" class="indexterm"></a> about appearances, namely, the appearance of intelligence. Perhaps, this is why the word "artificial" enters the title. The idea is that video games are primarily about having fun and interesting experiences. This means that the believability <a id="id530" class="indexterm"></a>of a game for the gamer rests on how engaged they are with the events actually happening in the game. Thus, whenever a <span class="strong"><strong>non-player character</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>), such<a id="id531" class="indexterm"></a> as an enemy wizard in an RPG, does something "silly" (like walking through solid walls for no good reason or aimlessly walking back and forth as though stuck), then the gamer perceives that something is wrong. They regard the characters as not acting intelligently just because the character's behavior, in those specific circumstances, is not appropriate and cannot be explained reasonably with reference to anything else happening in the game. The "mistake" or "silliness" of the character's behavior forces the player to recognize a glitch, and in doing so, the gamer is removed from the experience, becoming aware that it's just a game. The upshot of this is that for games, AI largely consists of making characters respond appropriately to their situation whenever the gamer is looking. In games where AI is for enemies or opponents, this consists largely of tweaking difficulty, that is, not making the AI too easy or too hard. Seen in this way, AI is not about building a mathematical model of the human mind and consciousness that simulates what happens to us while thinking from an inward or internal perspective. It's only about creating behaviors, making characters act as we'd expect them to under those specific conditions, as shown in the following screenshot. Consequently, there's something "hollow" about AI for games, but this philosophical observation need not concern us here any further.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_07_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The enemy AI character to be created using the Unity constructor mesh</p></div></div><p>In this chapter, we'll create a first-person sample game set inside a maze environment. Here, the player can attack enemies, and enemies can attack the player. The enemy mesh itself is based on the animated constructor character that ships with Unity and features the walk, run, and jump animations. The <a id="id532" class="indexterm"></a>constructor character (not class constructors) will search the<a id="id533" class="indexterm"></a> environment, look for the player, and when they are found, chase and attack them. The constructor can also be attacked, and when attacked, they will flee and search for power-ups if their health runs low. So, let's get started!</p></div>
