To put it another way, if you think about a game (such as a fantasy RPG), it's filled <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>with many independent things such as wizards, orcs, trees, houses, the player, quests, inventory items, weapons, spells, doorways, bridges, force fields, portals, guards, and so on. Many of these objects parallel <a id="id82" class="indexterm"></a>objects in the real world too. However, crucially, each of these things is an independent object; a wizard is different and separate from a force field, and a guard is different and separate from a tree. Each of these things, then, can be thought of as an objectâ€”a custom type. If we focus our attention on one specific object, an orc enemy, for example, we can identify the properties and behaviors in this object. The orc will have a position, rotation, and scale; these correspond to variables.</p><p>The orc might have several kinds of attacks too, such as a melee attack with an axe and a ranged attack with a crossbow. These attacks are performed through functions. In this way, a collection of variables and functions are brought together into a meaningful relationship. The process of bringing these things together is known as encapsulation. In this example, an orc has been encapsulated into a class. The class, in this case, represents the template for a general, abstract orc (the concept of an orc). Objects, in<a id="id83" class="indexterm"></a> contrast, are particular, concrete instantiations of the <code class="literal">Orc</code> class in the level. In Unity, script files define a class. To instantiate the class<a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a> as an object in the level, add it to <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. As we've seen, classes are attached to game objects as components. Components are objects, and multiple components together form a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. Refer to code sample 1-10 for a sample <code class="literal">Orc</code> class stub:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class Orc : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
06 //Reference to the transform component of orc (position, rotation, scale)
07 private Transform ThisTransform = null;
08 
09 //Enum for states of orc
10 public enum OrcStates {NEUTRAL, ATTACK_MELEE, ATTACK_RANGE};
11 
12 //Current state of orc
13 public OrcStates CurrentState = OrcStates.NEUTRAL;
14 
15 //Movement speed of orc in meters per second
16 	public float OrcSpeed = 10.0f;
17 
18 //Is orc friendly to player
19 public bool isFriendly = false;

21 //--------------------------------------------------
22 // Use this for initialization
23 void Start ()
24 {
25       //Get transform of orc
26       ThisTransform = transform;
27 }
