Tracepoints work like breakpoints, in that they mark lines <a id="id219" class="indexterm"></a>within your source file. They don't change the code itself, but (unlike breakpoints) they don't pause the program execution when encountered by the debugger. Instead, they perform a specified instruction<a id="id220" class="indexterm"></a> automatically. Typically, they print a debug statement to the <span class="strong"><strong>Application Output</strong></span> window in MonoDevelop, though not to the Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. To set a breakpoint in line 16 of code sample 2-10, position your cursor on line 16 and select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tracepoint</strong></span> in <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> from the application menu (or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F9</em></span>), as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_36.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Adding Tracepoint to the selected line in MonoDevelop</p></div></div><p>On selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tracepoint</strong></span> option, MonoDevelop will show the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Tracepoint</strong></span> dialog. The <span class="strong"><strong>Trace Text</strong></span> field allows you to input the text to be printed to the <span class="strong"><strong>Application Output</strong></span> window when the tracepoint is encountered at runtime. You can also insert the curly braces opening and<a id="id221" class="indexterm"></a> closing symbols to define the regions<a id="id222" class="indexterm"></a> in the string where expressions should be evaluated. This lets you print the values of variables into the debug string, such as <code class="literal">"Loop counter is {i}"</code>, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_37.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Setting Tracepoint Text</p></div></div><p>After clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, the<a id="id223" class="indexterm"></a> tracepoint is added to the selected line. Inside MonoDevelop, the line will be marked with a diamond shape as opposed to a circle; this diamond shape indicates a breakpoint:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_38.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Inserting a tracepoint</p></div></div><p>After setting the tracepoint in the selected line in the code editor and running the application via the attachment with MonoDevelop, the game will run as normal, directly from the Unity Editor. However, when the tracepoint is encountered, the application will not pause or enter the break <a id="id224" class="indexterm"></a>mode as it would with breakpoints. Instead, the tracepoint will automatically output its printed statements to MonoDevelop's <span class="strong"><strong>Application Output</strong></span> window, without causing a pause. By default, this window is docked at the bottom of the MonoDevelop interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_39.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Tracepoints can print statements such as Debug.Log to the Application Output window in MonoDevelop</p></div></div><p>Tracepoints are an effective and helpful alternative to using the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements inside Unity, and you don't need<a id="id225" class="indexterm"></a> to amend your code in any way to use them as you do with <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code>. Unfortunately, they don't print directly to Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. Instead, they appear inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Application Output</strong></span> window in <a id="id226" class="indexterm"></a>MonoDevelop. However, as long as you recognize this, working with tracepoints can be a powerful and useful method to find and remove bugs.</p></div>
