<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec26"></a>Compilation errors and the console</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Debugging typically refers to<a id="id137" class="indexterm"></a> error-busting techniques for runtime use; that is, it refers to the things you can do to find and correct errors when your game is running. This understanding of debugging, of course, presupposes that your code is already valid and<a id="id138" class="indexterm"></a> compiled. The implicit assumption is that you can write valid statements in C# and compile code, and you just want to find runtime errors that occur as a result of program logic. Thus, the focus is not on syntax but on logic, and this is indeed true. However, in this section, I'll speak very briefly about code compilation, about writing valid code, and using the console to find and correct errors of validity. This is important, both to introduce the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window generally and also to establish a firm basis of thinking about debugging in more depth. Consider the following code sample 2-1 script file (<code class="literal">ErrorScript.cs</code>):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class ErrorScript : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
<span class="strong"><strong>06 int MyNumber = 5;</strong></span>
07 
08 // Use this for initialization
09 void Start () {
10 
<span class="strong"><strong>11        mynumber = 7;</strong></span>
12 }
13 
14 // Update is called once per frame
15 void Update () {
<span class="strong"><strong>16        mynumber = 10;</strong></span>
17 }
18 }</pre></div><p>To compile the preceding code sample 2-1, simply save the script file in MonoDevelop (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>) and then refocus the Unity Editor window. From here, compilation will happen automatically. If it doesn't, you<a id="id139" class="indexterm"></a> can also right-click on the script file from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Reimport</strong></span> from the context menu. For the code sample 2-1, two errors are generated, and these will be shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. If you don't already have the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window open, it could be shown by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> option from <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> from the application menu. The <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window is highly important, and you'll almost always want it open somewhere in the interface. This is where<a id="id140" class="indexterm"></a> Unity as an engine communicates with you as a developer. Thus, if your code has compile errors, Unity would list them to <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>, letting you know what they are.</p><p>The code sample 2-1 generates two compile-time errors, as shown in the following screenshot. These happen because lines 11 and 16 refer to the variable <code class="literal">mynumber</code> that doesn't exist, although <code class="literal">MyNumber</code> does (case sensitivity). Compile-time errors such as these are critical because they render your code invalid. This means you cannot compile your code and run your game until the errors are corrected.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Viewing compilation errors in the Console window</p></div></div><p>If compilation errors are not shown in <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> as expected, then make sure that the errors filter is enabled. To enable this, click on the error filter icon (a red exclamation mark icon) in the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. The <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window features three filters, comments (<span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>), warnings (<span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>), and errors (<span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span>), as shown in the following screenshot, to hide and show specific <a id="id141" class="indexterm"></a>messages. These toggle the visibility of each message type in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. Comments refer to the messages that you, as a programmer, explicitly print to the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window from your code using the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statement. We'll see examples of this shortly (you can also use the <code class="literal">Print</code> function). Warnings refer<a id="id142" class="indexterm"></a> to potential issues or wastages detected in your code. These are syntactically valid and will compile even if ignored by you, but they might cause problems or have unintended and wasteful results. Errors refer to any compile-time errors found in your code that affect its compilation validity, such as with code sample 2-1.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Enabling/disabling the Console window filters</p></div></div><p>When the console fills with more than one error, the errors are typically listed in the order in which they were detected by the compiler, that is, from top to bottom. It's considered best practice to tackle errors in order, because earlier errors can cause later ones. Thus, resolving earlier errors can, potentially, resolve later ones. To resolve an error, start by double-clicking on the error from the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window, and MonoDevelop will open automatically, highlighting the line where the error itself was found or where the error was first detected. It is important to note that MonoDevelop will take you to the line where the error was first detected, although resolving the error will not always involve editing that line specifically. Depending on the issue, you will need to change to a different line than the<a id="id143" class="indexterm"></a>one highlighted. If you double-click on the top error (first error) in <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>, as generated by the code sample 2-1, MonoDevelop will open and<a id="id144" class="indexterm"></a> highlight line 11. You can fix this error in two ways: either by renaming <code class="literal">mynumber</code> to <code class="literal">MyNumber</code> in line 11 or by renaming the variable <code class="literal">MyNumber</code> to <code class="literal">mynumber</code> in line 6. Now, consider the following code sample 2-2:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class ErrorScript : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
06 int MyNumber = 5;
07 
08 // Use this for initialization
09 void Start () {
10 	
11       MyNumber = 7;
12 }
13 
14 // Update is called once per frame
15 void Update () {
16       MyNumber = 10;
17 }
18 }</pre></div><p>Code sample 2-2 fixes the errors in code sample 2-1. However, it leaves us with a warning instead (as shown in the following screenshot). This indicates that the variable <code class="literal">MyNumber</code> is never used. It's assigned a value in lines 11 and 16, but this assignment is never of any ultimate<a id="id145" class="indexterm"></a> consequence for the application. Here, this warning could be ignored and the code would remain valid. Warnings should be seen primarily as recommendations <a id="id146" class="indexterm"></a>made by the compiler about your code. How you handle them is ultimately your choice, but I recommend that you try to eliminate both errors and warnings wherever practical.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Try to eliminate both errors and warnings</p></div></div></div>
