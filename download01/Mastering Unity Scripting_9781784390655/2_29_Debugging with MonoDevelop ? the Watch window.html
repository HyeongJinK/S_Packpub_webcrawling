One way to quickly add a watch for a variable while it is<a id="id189" class="indexterm"></a> in the break mode is to highlight it in the code editor and then hover your mouse over it. When you do this, leaving the mouse hovered <a id="id190" class="indexterm"></a>for a few seconds, a pop-up window appears automatically. This window allows the full inspection of a variable, as shown in the following screenshot. You can contract and expand the members of a class and examine the state of all its variables.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_23.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Inspecting a variable with hover watches in the break mode</p></div></div><p>You can inspect practically all variable values for any active object using this hover method. However, typically, you'll want to place a more permanent watch on a variable and even a group of variables<a id="id191" class="indexterm"></a> so that you can see their values collated together in a list. For this, you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> window docked in the<a id="id192" class="indexterm"></a> bottom-left corner of the MonoDevelop interface. To add a new watch in this window, right-click inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> list and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Add watch</strong></span> from the context menu, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_24.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Adding a watch to the Watch window</p></div></div><p>On adding a new watch, you can enter any valid expression or variable name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> field, and the resultant<a id="id193" class="indexterm"></a> value will be shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Value</strong></span> column, as shown in the following screenshot. The values shown in the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> field are valid for the current line of execution only, and they<a id="id194" class="indexterm"></a> will change as the program progresses. Remember that you can add a watch for any valid variable that can be referenced in the current scope, including <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">tag</code>, <code class="literal">transform.position</code>, and so on.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_25.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Adding a watch to the Watch window</p></div></div><p>You can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> window to examine any valid variables and expressions, whether they pertain to the active class or line of code. This means you can see the value for global variables and any variables related to other classes or objects, as long as they're valid and in memory. However, if you're only interested in viewing local variables, that is, variables whose scope is relevant to the block of code being executed in the current step, then you could use<a id="id195" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Locals</strong></span> window instead of <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span>. This window automatically adds watches for all the local variables. You don't need to <a id="id196" class="indexterm"></a>add them manually. Here, the <span class="strong"><strong>Locals</strong></span> window is by default tabbed next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_26.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Inspecting local variables only with the Locals window</p></div></div><p>If you don't see any of the relevant <span class="strong"><strong>Debug</strong></span> windows in the MonoDevelop interface, such as the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> window or the <span class="strong"><strong>Locals</strong></span> window, you can show or hide them manually by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Debug Windows</strong></span> option in <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> from the MonoDevelop application menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_27.jpg" /></div><p>One great thing about the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Locals</strong></span> windows is that they offer read and write access to variables. This means that you're not restricted to simply viewing variable values, but you can write to them as well, changing the variable from within MonoDevelop. To do<a id="id197" class="indexterm"></a> this, simply double-click on<a id="id198" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Value</strong></span> field from either the <span class="strong"><strong>Watch</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Locals</strong></span> window and then enter a new value for the variable:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_28.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Editing values from the Watch window</p></div></div></div>
