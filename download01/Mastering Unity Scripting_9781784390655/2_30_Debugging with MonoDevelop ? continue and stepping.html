You might want to continue program execution, which effectively hands program control back to Unity. This allows the execution to continue as normal, until it meets the next breakpoint, if any. This method effectively resumes execution as normal, and it'll never pause again unless a new breakpoint is encountered. To<a id="id200" class="indexterm"></a> continue in this way from MonoDevelop, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>F5</em></span> key or press the play button from the MonoDevelop toolbar. Otherwise, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Continue Debugging</strong></span> option in <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> from the MonoDevelop application menu, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_29.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Exiting the break mode and resuming with Continue Debugging</p></div></div><p>There are many occasions, however, where you don't want to continue execution in this way. Instead, you want to step execution over the lines of code, line by line, evaluating each line as it progresses and examining the program flow to see how variables change and are affected by<a id="id201" class="indexterm"></a> statements. The step mode effectively lets you observe the program flow as it happens. There are three main kinds of steps in debugging: step over, step into, and step out. Step over instructs the debugger to move to the next line of code and then to pause again, awaiting your inspection as though the next line were a new breakpoint. If an external function call is encountered in the next line, the debugger would invoke the function as usual and then step to the<a id="id202" class="indexterm"></a> next line without stepping into the function. In this way, the function is "stepped over". The function still happens, but it happens in the continue mode, and the next step or breakpoint is set in the next line after the function. To step over, press <span class="emphasis"><em>F10</em></span>, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Step Over</strong></span> command in <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> from the application menu, or press the <span class="strong"><strong>Step Over</strong></span> button in the MonoDevelop toolbar, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_30.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Stepping over code moves execution to the next statement without stepping into an external function</p></div></div><p>If an external function call is encountered, the <span class="strong"><strong>Step Into</strong></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>F11</em></span>) command allows debugging to enter this function. This effectively sets the next breakpoint in the first line of the entered function that allows debugging to resume in the next step. This can be useful if you need to<a id="id203" class="indexterm"></a> observe how many functions are working together. If, at any point, you want to exit the entered function by <a id="id204" class="indexterm"></a>moving it forward in the continue mode, you could use the <span class="strong"><strong>Step Out</strong></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F11</em></span>) command, and the execution would resume in the next line in the outer function.</p></div>
