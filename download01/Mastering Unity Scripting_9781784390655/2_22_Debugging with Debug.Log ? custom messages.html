This technique is versatile and appealing because it can be used in practically every<a id="id148" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IDE</strong></span>) and not just MonoDevelop. Further, all the Unity objects, including vector and color objects, have a convenient<a id="id149" class="indexterm"></a> <code class="literal">ToString</code> function that allows their internal members (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>) to be printed to a human-readable string—one that can be easily sent to the console for debugging purposes. For example, consider the following code sample 2-3. This code sample demonstrates an important debugging workflow, namely, printing a status <a id="id150" class="indexterm"></a>message about an object at its instantiation. This script, when attached to a scene object, prints its world position to <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>, along with a descriptive message:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class CubeScript : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
06 // Use this for initialization
07 void Start () {

08        Debug.Log ("Object created in scene at position: " + <span class="strong"><strong>transform.position.ToString()</strong></span>);<span class="strong"><strong>transform.position.ToString()</strong></span>);

09 }
10 }</pre></div><p>The following screenshot demonstrates the output of this code in <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> when attached to a cube <code class="literal">GameObject</code>. The <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> message is printed in the main console message list. If the message is selected with the mouse, <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> will also indicate a script file and line associated with the statement.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Debug.Log messages can convert objects to strings, and the Console window also indicates an associated script file and line</p></div></div><p>The main limitations of <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> as a debugging technique relate to code cleanliness and program complexity. First, the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements require you to explicitly add code to your source files. When you're done debugging, you'll need to either remove the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements manually or leave them there, which is wasteful and results in confusion, especially if you have to add the additional <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements in many other places. Second, though <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> is useful to target specific problems or monitor specific variables over time, it's ultimately awkward to get a higher-level picture of your code and its execution to trace errors whose presence you detect but whose location is entirely unknown. These<a id="id151" class="indexterm"></a> criticisms, however, shouldn't be regarded as advice to avoid using the <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements entirely. They should be considered only to use them appropriately. <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> works best when an error or problem can be traced to a prime suspect object, and you want to observe or monitor its values to see how they change or update, especially during events such as <code class="literal">OnStart</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Removing the Debug.Log statements</strong></span>
</p><p>When your <a id="id152" class="indexterm"></a>game is ready to build and ship, remember to remove or comment away any <code class="literal">Debug.Log</code> statements for extra cleanliness.</p></div></div>
