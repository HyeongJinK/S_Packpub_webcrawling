Developers should select one of these two from<a id="id443" class="indexterm"></a> the outset and apply it consistently throughout their project; this writes all scripts in the selected language. Failure to do so (by mixing script files in different languages) typically causes unnecessary headache and confusion. However, once you've settled on a language, such as C#, it usually won't offer everything you need it to do to create games. C#, on its own, can neither load and parse XML files to<a id="id444" class="indexterm"></a> support save-game data, nor can it create window objects and GUI widgets to perform advanced search and query behaviors on complex data sets and collections. To achieve these additional behaviors and lots more, we must turn to external libraries. Some libraries can be purchased directly from the Unity's Asset Store, and these are typically used for a specific and dedicated purpose. However, Unity ships with the Mono Framework, which is a free, cross-platform, and open source implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework (a programming library), and it offers most classes available in this library. The .NET Framework features classes to handle strings, file input-output, search and sort data, keep track of dynamic lists, parse XML, and more. This means that through Mono an extensive toolkit is open to you to effectively and efficiently manage data in your application. This chapter explores some of the many ways in which Mono can be deployed in a Unity application by considering lists, stacks, <span class="strong"><strong>Language Integrated Query</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Linq</strong></span>), regular expressions, enumerators, and so on.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the Mono Framework interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_06_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The Mono Framework ships with the Unity engine</p></div></div></div>
