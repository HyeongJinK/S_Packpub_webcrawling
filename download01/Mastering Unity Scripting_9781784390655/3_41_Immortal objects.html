The difference between scenes is like the difference between separate universes. Consequently, objects don't survive outside the scene to which they belong; this means that they die whenever<a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a> the active scene changes. This is typically how you want objects to behave, because scenes are usually very different and separate from one another. However, even so, there will be objects that you don't want destroyed. There will be objects that you need <span class="emphasis"><em>carried over</em></span> between scenes, such as the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> character, a high-score system, or a <code class="literal">GameManager</code> class. These are normally high-order objects whose existence shouldn't be limited to specific scenes; they should rather span or arc across multiple scenes. You can create object <a id="id279" class="indexterm"></a>persistence easily using the <code class="literal">DontDestroyOnLoad</code> function, but it has important consequences worth considering. Take a look at the following code sample 3-12:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
//-------------------------------------------
//This object will survive scene changes
public class PersistentObj : MonoBehaviour
{
  //-------------------------------------------
  // Use this for initialization
  void Start ()
  {
    //Make this object survive
<span class="strong"><strong>    DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);</strong></span>
  }
}
//-------------------------------------------</pre></div><p>Object persistence between scenes is important, but <span class="emphasis"><em>travelling objects</em></span> take their baggage with them as they move between scenes. This means any and all child objects will survive with the persistent object as well as any assets or resources it uses, such as meshes, textures, sounds, and others. This is not a problem per se, but it is important to be aware of it. For this reason, many persistent objects are created light, that is, as empty game objects with no children, featuring only the basic component makeup they need to work properly. This ensures that only the essential, critical data survives between scene changes.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scene Changing</strong></span>
</p><p>To change<a id="id280" class="indexterm"></a> the active scene in Unity, use the <code class="literal">Application.LoadLevel</code> function. There are variations on this, including <code class="literal">LoadLevelAsync</code>, <code class="literal">LoadLevelAdditive</code>, and <code class="literal">LoadLevelAdditiveAsync</code>. More information <a id="id281" class="indexterm"></a>on the level-loading functions can<a id="id282" class="indexterm"></a> be found online at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.html</a>.</p></div><p>As we saw earlier, the <code class="literal">DontDestroyOnLoad</code> function is called on an existing object in the active scene and prevents that object from being destroyed on future scene changes. From this, however, an issue sometimes arises concerning object duplication. Specifically, if you later reload or return to the original scene in which the persistent object first existed, then a <a id="id283" class="indexterm"></a>persistent duplicate of the object is made, namely, the persistent original that came with you from the previous scene and a newer instantiation of the object created for the newly entered instance of the scene. This problem is, of course, magnified for each occasion you re-enter the scene, as each time a new duplicate will be made. Such duplication is usually not what you want. You typically want only one instance of the object to exist at any one time: one player, one game manager, or one high-score board. To achieve this, you'll need to create a singleton object, as explained in the next section.</p></div>
