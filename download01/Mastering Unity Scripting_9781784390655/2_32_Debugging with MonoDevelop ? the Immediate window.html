The <span class="strong"><strong>Immediate</strong></span> window is docked by default in the bottom-right corner of the MonoDevelop interface. It becomes active in the break mode. Using it, we <a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a>can enter expressions <a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a>and statements that are evaluated immediately as though they were part of the source code for this step. We can get and set the values for active variables as well as perform additional operations. We can write any valid expression, such as <code class="literal">2+2</code> and <code class="literal">10*5</code>. The result of these expressions is output in the next line in the <span class="strong"><strong>Immediate</strong></span> window, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_32.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Evaluating expressions inside the Immediate window</p></div></div><p>Of course, you're not<a id="id213" class="indexterm"></a> simply restricted to writing isolated statements that involve basic arithmetical operations, such as addition and subtraction. You <a id="id214" class="indexterm"></a>can write full expressions that include active variables:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_33.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Writing more advanced expressions in the Immediate window</p></div></div><p>Overall, the <span class="strong"><strong>Immediate</strong></span> window is especially useful to test code, write alternative scenarios in the <span class="strong"><strong>Immediate</strong></span> window, and see how they evaluate.</p></div>
