In implementing such a manager, we were able to rely on either interfaces or delegates, and either method is powerful and extensible. Specifically, we saw how it's easy to add more and more functionality into an <code class="literal">Update</code> function but how doing this can lead to severe performance issues. Better is to analyze the connections between your functionality to refactor it into an event-driven framework. Essentially, events are the raw material of event-driven systems. They represent a necessary connection between one action (the cause) and another (the response). To manage events, we created the <code class="literal">EventManager</code> classâ€”an integrated class or system that links posters to listeners. It receives notifications from posters about events as and when they happen and then immediately dispatches a function call to all listeners for the event. In the next chapter, we'll examine cameras and rendering.</p></div>
