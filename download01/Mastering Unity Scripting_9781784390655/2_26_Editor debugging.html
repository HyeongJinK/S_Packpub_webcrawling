With Unity, you can play your game and edit the scene at the same time while the game is running. You can even observe and edit properties in the Object Inspector, both private and public, as we saw earlier. This can give you a complete and graphical picture of your game at runtime; and allow you to detect and observe a wide range of potential errors. This form of debugging should not be underestimated. To get the most from in-editor debugging, activate the <span class="strong"><strong>Debug</strong></span> mode from the Object Inspector by clicking on the context menu icon in the top-right corner of the inspector and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Debug</strong></span> from the menu, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Accessing the Debug mode from the Object Inspector</p></div></div><p>Next, make sure that your viewports are configured appropriately so that they allow you to see both the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> views simultaneously during the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode, along with the <span class="strong"><strong>Stats</strong></span> panel. To achieve this, disable the <span class="strong"><strong>Maximize on Play</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab toolbar if it's activated. Then, arrange the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tabs side-by-side in the interface, or else arrange them across multiple monitors if you have more than one. Multiple monitors are strongly recommended if your budget allows, but a single monitor can work well too, provided you invest extra time arranging and sizing each window to best meet your needs. In addition, you'll generally want the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window visible and the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel hidden to prevent accidental selection and movement of assets, as shown in the following<a id="id173" class="indexterm"></a> screenshot. Remember that you can also <a id="id174" class="indexterm"></a>customize the Unity GUI Layout.

Remember that you can still use the transform (position, rotation, and scale) tools in-game to reposition the player or enemies, thus trying out new values and seeing which ones work and which ones do not. Most importantly, however, all edits to the scene in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> mode, via the Object Inspector or transform tools, are temporary and will revert back after the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode ends. For this reason, if you need to make permanent changes to settings, then you would need to make them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> mode. You can, of course, copy and paste values between the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> modes using the <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> context menu at any time, as shown in the following screenshot. Remember that the hot key (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span>) toggles between the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> mode and (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> between paused and unpaused).
