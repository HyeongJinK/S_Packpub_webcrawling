The ability to do this is not always essential to building Unity games themselves but it can make your work easier. Furthermore, it can lead to making money via the Asset Store, should you wish to develop custom add-ons that can help other developers. Here, you saw how to create a Batch Rename tool with the <code class="literal">ScriptableWizard</code> class and then a color blending property for the Object Inspector. Next, we made extensive use of reflection to expose all public C# properties in the Object Inspector that allowed us direct access to the set and get property values as if we'd accessed them at runtime. Further, we moved on to see how a localization framework could be implemented from XML files via the <code class="literal">Editor</code> classes that allow string variables to be automatically changed to match a selected language.

In the next chapter, we'll move our conceptual and technical baggage to explore the world of 2D from more unconventional angles.</p></div>
