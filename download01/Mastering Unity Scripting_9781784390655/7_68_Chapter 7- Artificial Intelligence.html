Here, we'll cover the development of a single Unity project from start to finish in creating a maze scene that features enemy characters with<a id="id526" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>); these characters have the ability to search for and chase us, attack us, and also flee from us while looking for health-restore potions. The following screenshot shows the maze scene in Unity:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_07_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The maze scene</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip48"></a>Tip</h3><p>The AI project for this book can be found in the book's companion files (code bundle) in the <code class="literal">ai</code> folder of this chapter.</p></div><p>In creating this project, we'll apply nearly all the concepts and ideas seen so far in an isolated and pure form, looking at how they come together in the project, alongside a unique range of AI concepts, such as <a id="id527" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Finite State Machines</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FSMs</strong></span>), navigation meshes, line of sight, and more. To follow this chapter and get the most from it, I recommend that you create a new and blank <a id="id528" class="indexterm"></a>Unity project and take each step from start to finish. The final, completed project arrived at by the end of this chapter can be found in the book's companion files (code bundle) in the <code class="literal">ai</code> folder of this chapter.</p></div>
