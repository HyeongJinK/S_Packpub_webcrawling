Scripting in Unity begins by creating a new script file, which is a standard text file added to the project. This file defines a program that lists all the instructions for Unity to follow. As mentioned, the instructions can be written in either C#, JavaScript, or Boo; for this book, the language will be C#. There are multiple ways to create a script file in Unity.</p><p>One way is to go to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>C# Script</strong></span> from the application menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_01_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Creating a script file via the application menu</p></div></div><p>Another way is to<a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a> right-click on the empty space anywhere within the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and choose the <span class="strong"><strong>C# Script</strong></span> option in the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> menu from the context menu, as shown in the following screenshot. This creates the asset in the currently open folder.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_01_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Creating a script file via the Project panel context menu</p></div></div><p>Once created, a new script file will be generated inside the <code class="literal">Project</code> folder with a <code class="literal">.cs</code> file extension (representing C Sharp). The filename is especially important and has serious implications on the validity of your script files because Unity uses the filename to determine the name of a C# class to be created inside the file. Classes are considered in more depth later in this chapter. In short, be sure to give your file a unique and meaningful name.</p><p>By unique, we mean that no other script file anywhere in your project should have the same name, whether it is located in a different folder or not. All the script files should have a <a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a>unique name across the project. The name should also be meaningful by expressing clearly what your script intends to do. Further, there are rules of validity governing filenames as well as class names in C#. The formal definition of these rules can be<a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a> found online at <a class="ulink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670%28VS.71%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670%28VS.71%29.aspx</a>. In short, the filename should start with a letter or underscore character only (numbers are not permitted for the first character), and the name should include no spaces, although underscores (_) are allowed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_01_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Name your script files in a unique way and according to the C# class naming conventions</p></div></div><p>Unity script files can be opened and examined in any text editor or IDE, including Visual Studio and Notepad++, but Unity provides the free and open source editor, <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>. This <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>software is part of the main Unity package included in the installation and doesn't need to be downloaded separately. By double-clicking on the script file from the<a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, Unity will automatically open the file inside MonoDevelop. If you later decide to, or need to, rename the script file, you also need to rename the C# class inside the file to match the filename exactly, as shown in the following screenshot. Failure to do so will result in invalid code and compilation errors or problems when attaching the script file to your objects.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_01_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Renaming classes to match the renamed script files</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Compiling code</strong></span>
</p><p>To compile <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>code in Unity, you just need to save your script file in MonoDevelop by choosing the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> option in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu from the application menu (or by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> on the keyboard) and then return to the main Unity Editor. On refocusing on the Unity window, Unity automatically detects code changes in the files and then compiles your code in response. If there are errors, the game cannot be run, and the errors are printed to the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. If the compile was successful, you don't need to do anything else, except press <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span> toolbar and test run your game. Take care here; if you forget to save your file in MonoDevelop after making code changes, then Unity will still use the older, compiled version of your code. For this reason as well as for the purpose of backup, it's<a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a> really important to save your work regularly, so be sure to press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> to save in MonoDevelop.</p></div></div>
