These issues might superficially seem simple, but understanding their usage and being able to employ them to manage objects is a powerful skill that's required in almost all Unity game development projects. Specifically, we've seen the <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, a collection of components that interact to produce a unified behavior. The Transform component is especially important. We also looked at scenes. A scene is a single time and space inside which <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> exist. Typically, a scene is a self-enclosed entity that prevents any objects from existing outside it. Further, every scene works through a concept of time that makes change and animation possible. Time can be measured through <code class="literal">deltaTime</code>, which acts like a multiplier and allows us to achieve frame-rate-independent motion. Finally, we explored the singleton design pattern, which uses static members to define classes that, in practice, can only have one instantiation active in memory at any one time. In the next chapter, we'll move on to event-driven programming.</p></div>
