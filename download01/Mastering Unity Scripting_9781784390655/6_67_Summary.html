It took a three-part structure. First, we explored common data structures used in C#, including <code class="literal">List</code>, <code class="literal">Dictionary</code>, and <code class="literal">Stack</code>. From there, we moved on to investigate their common usages in storing and searching data and in organizing and processing strings. We also explored regular expressions for searching strings for patterns of data and the Linq language for filtering not only strings but all the collection-type objects available in Mono. Then, finally, we examined various methods to import text data, both internally to the project and from local files, as well as text data streamed across the Web. The next chapter moves into the world of artificial intelligence; it considers path-finding, finite state machines, line of sight, decision making, ray casting, and more.</p></div>
