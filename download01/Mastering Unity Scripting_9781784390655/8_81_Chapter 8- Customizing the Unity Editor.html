Nevertheless, there are times during development when you probably wished the editor offered a specific feature that it doesn't have or behaved in a particular way, simply because it would be more convenient for you and your specific game. Maybe you'd like the path editing features, batch renaming functionality, or mesh creation tools, among others. In such cases, you can search the Asset Store for add-ons that meet your needs. But even then, you may still not find what you need. Consequently, the focus then turns to how the editor can be adapted or customized to achieve your purpose. Thankfully, there are many ways Unity can be changed as a tool, and this chapter focuses on particular case studies. First, it explores how to create a<a id="id601" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Batch Rename</strong></span> tool for renaming multiple selected objects in one operation. Second, it covers how to create a color range field in the Object Inspector to blend between two colors using a slider. Third, it explores how to expose public C# properties in the Object Inspector for both setting and getting values. Lastly, it covers how to use C# attributes to create a localization toolkit that allows you to automatically change all in-game strings to a chosen language (English, French, and so on) at the touch of a button.</p></div>
