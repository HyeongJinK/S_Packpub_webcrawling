Variables often correspond to the letters used in algebra and stand in for numerical quantities, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>b</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>. If you need to keep track of information, such as the player name, score, position, orientation, ammo, health, and a multitude of other types of quantifiable data (expressed by nouns), then a <a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a>variable will be your friend. A variable represents a single unit of information. This means that multiple variables are needed to hold multiple units, one variable for each. Further, each unit will be of a specific type or kind. For example, the player's name represents a sequence of letters, such as "John", "Tom", and "David". In contrast, the player's health refers to numerical data, such as 100 percent (1) or 50 percent (0.5), depending on whether the player has sustained damage. So, each variable necessarily has a data type. In C#, variables are created using a specific kind of syntax or grammar. Consider the following code sample 1-1 that defines a new script file and class called <code class="literal">MyNewScript</code>, which declares three different variables with class scope, each of a unique type. The word "declare" means that we, as programmers, are telling the C# compiler about the variables required:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class MyNewScript : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
06     public string PlayerName = "";
07     public int PlayerHealth = 100;
08     public Vector3 Position = Vector3.zero;
09 
10     // Use this for initialization
11     void Start () {
12 
13     }
14 
15     // Update is called once per frame
16     void Update () {
17 
18     }
19 }</pre></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Variable data types</strong></span>
</p><p>Each variable<a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a> has a data type. A few of the most common ones include <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">float</code>, <code class="literal">bool</code>, <code class="literal">string</code>, and <code class="literal">Vector3</code>. Here, are a few examples of these types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">int</code> (integer or whole number) = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3…</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">float</code> (floating point number or decimal) = -3.0, -2.5, 0.0, 1.7, 3.9…</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">bool</code> (Boolean or <code class="literal">true</code>/<code class="literal">false</code>) = <code class="literal">true</code> or <code class="literal">false</code> (1 or 0)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">string</code> (string of characters) = "hello world", "a", "another word…"</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Vector3</code> (a position value) = (0, 0, 0), (10, 5, 0)…</p></li></ul></div></div><p>Notice from lines 06-08 of code sample 1-1 that each variable is assigned a starting value, and its data type is explicitly<a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a> stated as <code class="literal">int</code> (integer), <code class="literal">string</code>, and <code class="literal">Vector3</code>, which represent the points in a 3D space (as well as directions, as we'll see). There's no full list of possible data types, as this will vary extensively, depending on your project (and you'll also create your own!). Throughout this book, we'll work with the most common types, so you'll see plenty of examples. Finally, each variable declaration line begins with the keyword public. Usually, variables can be either <code class="literal">public</code> or <code class="literal">private</code> (and there is another one called <code class="literal">protected</code>, which is not covered here).The <code class="literal">public</code> variables will be accessible and editable in Unity's Object Inspector (as we'll see soon, you can also refer to the preceding screenshot), and they can also be accessed by other classes.</p><p>Variables are so named because their values might vary (or change) over time. Of course, they don't change in arbitrary and unpredictable ways. Rather, they change whenever we explicitly change them, either through direct assignment in code, from the Object Inspector, or through methods and function calls. They can be changed both directly and indirectly. Variables can be assigned values directly, such as the following one:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">PlayerName = "NewName";</pre></div><p>They can also be assigned indirectly using expressions, that is, statements whose final value must be evaluated before the assignment can be finally made to the variable as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">//Variable will result to 50, because: 100 x 0.5 = 50
PlayerHealth = 100 * 0.5;</pre></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Variable scope</strong></span>
</p><p>Each variable is<a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a> declared with an implicit scope. The scope determines the lifetime of a variable, that is, the places inside a source file where a variable can be successfully referenced and accessed. Scope is determined by the place where the variable is declared. The variables declared in code sample 1-1 have class scope, because they are declared at the top of a class and outside any functions. This means they can be accessed everywhere throughout the class, and (being public) they can also be accessed from other classes. Variables can also be declared inside specific functions. These are known as local variables, because their scope is restricted to the function, that is, a local variable cannot be accessed outside the function<a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a> in which it was declared. Classes and functions are considered later in this chapter.</p><p>More information on<a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a> variables and their usage in C# can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691160%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691160%28v=vs.71%29.aspx</a>.</p></div></div>
