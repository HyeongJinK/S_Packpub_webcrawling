This type of camera most closely corresponds to real-life cameras that have a position within the 3D space, a curved lens, and employ methods to convert<a id="id404" class="indexterm"></a> captured images onto a flat, 2D surface, like a screen. The chief symptom of such a camera is foreshortening, the name given to the distortion applied to rendered objects. Specifically, rendered objects grow smaller as they recede into the distance, the shape and appearance of objects change as they move further from the center of vision, and all parallel lines converge at a vanishing point somewhere in the distance, whether on the horizon line itself or on a secondary line. In contrast to perspective cameras, however, there are orthographic cameras. These are useful for the creation of 2D and truly isometric games and not just for the semblance of isometric. With orthographic cameras, the lens is flattened out to a plane, and the result is a loss of foreshortening, that is, parallel lines remain parallel, objects don't shrink with distance, 2D remains 2D even when moved away from the center of the view, and so on. You can easily switch a camera from <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> using the <span class="strong"><strong>Projection</strong></span> type setting from the Object Inspector, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_05_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Changing a Perspective camera to an Orthographic one</p></div></div><p>After changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> type to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>, the camera frustum will also change from a trapezoidal volume to a box. Everything within the box will be visible, and nearer objects will continue to obscure more distant ones, but all other senses of depth will be lost, as shown in the following screenshot. Hence, this camera is considered suitable for 2D games.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_05_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The frustum for an Orthographic camera is a box</p></div></div><p>The central problem when working with the <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> cameras is how to create a 1:1 relationship between world units (in the scene) and pixels (on screen). This problem arises because in 2D games and GUIs, it's useful to show graphics on screen at their default and correct sizes, as defined in the texture files. In most 3D games, by contrast, texture mapping, foreshortening, and perspective means textures are seen distorted, that is, projected onto the<a id="id405" class="indexterm"></a> surface of 3D objects where they are viewed not directly as though in a photo-editing program, but in perspective. With 2D games and sprites, the situation is different. These graphics are typically viewed head on. For this reason, it's desirable to display them in their default sizes, pixel for pixel. This kind of display is called pixel perfection, because each pixel in the texture will be shown onscreen and in the game, unchanged. Achieving this in practice, however, requires a specific approach. In short, to map 1 world unit to 1 pixel, the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> tab should be set to half the vertical resolution of the game. Thus, if your game runs at 1024 x 768, the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> field should be <code class="literal">364</code>, because 768 / 2 = 364, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_05_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>The Size field controls how world units map to pixels on screen</p></div></div><p>You can set the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> field directly in the editor, but this would only work if your game resolution is constant<a id="id406" class="indexterm"></a> and never changes. If the user can resize the game window or change the game resolution, then you would need to update the camera size in script, as shown in the following code sample 5-8:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 //-------------------------------------------------------
02 using UnityEngine;
03 using System.Collections;
04 //-------------------------------------------------------
05 [RequireComponent(typeof(Camera))] 
06 //-------------------------------------------------------
07 public class OrthoCam : MonoBehaviour
08 {
09 //private reference to camera component
10 private Camera Cam = null;
11 
12 //Reference to Pixels to World Units Scale
13 public float PixelsToWorldUnits = 200f;
14 //-------------------------------------------------------
15 // Use this for initialization
16 void Awake () 
17 {
18        //Get camera reference
19        Cam = GetComponent&lt;Camera&gt;();
20 }
21 //-------------------------------------------------------
22 // Update is called once per frame
23 void LateUpdate () 
24 {
25        //Update orthographic size
26        Cam.orthographicSize = Screen.height / 2f / PixelsToWorldUnits;

27 }
28 //-------------------------------------------------------
29 }
30 //-------------------------------------------------------</pre></div><p>Notice that the member variable <code class="literal">PixelsToWorldUnits</code> has been added to line 13 to scale the orthographic <a id="id407" class="indexterm"></a>size according to the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixels To Units</strong></span> field of imported sprite textures, as shown in the following screenshot. This helps ensure that sprites will appear in their correct pixel sizes when shown on screen. This is so because all sprites are necessarily scaled by this value to map pixels in the texture to units in the world.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_05_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Setting the Pixels to Units scale for sprite textures</p></div></div></div>
