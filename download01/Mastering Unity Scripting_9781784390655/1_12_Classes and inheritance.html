Having done so, you then decide to make two upgraded types. One is an Orc Warlord, with better armor and<a id="id88" class="indexterm"></a> weapons, and the other is an Orc Mage who, as the name implies, is a spell caster. Both can do everything that the ordinary orc can do, but more besides. Now, to implement this, you can create three separate classes, <code class="literal">Orc</code>, <code class="literal">OrcWarlord</code>, and <code class="literal">OrcMage</code>, by copying and pasting common code between them.</p><p>The problem is that as Orc Warlord and Orc Mage share a lot of common ground and behaviors with orc, a lot of code will be <a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a>wastefully copied and pasted to replicate the common behaviors. Furthermore, if you discovered a bug in the shared code of one class, you'd need to copy and paste the fix to the other classes to propagate it. This is both tedious and technically dangerous, as it risks wasting time, introducing bugs, and causing needless confusion. Instead, the object-oriented concept of inheritance can help us. Inheritance allows you to create a completely new class that implicitly absorbs or contains the functionality of another class, that is, it allows you to build a new class that extends<a id="id90" class="indexterm"></a> an existing class without affecting the original one. When inheritance happens, two classes are brought into a relationship with each other. The original class (such as the <code class="literal">Orc</code> class) is known as the case class or ancestor class. The new class (such as the Orc Warlord or Orc Mage), which extends on the ancestor class, is called a super class or derived class.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"></a>Tip</h3><p>More information <a id="id91" class="indexterm"></a>on inheritance in C# can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms173149%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms173149%28v=vs.80%29.aspx</a>.</p></div><p>By default, every new Unity script file creates a new class derived from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>. This means every new script contains all the <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> functionality and has the potential to go beyond, based<a id="id92" class="indexterm"></a> on the additional code that you add. To prove this, refer to the following code sample 1-11:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">01 using UnityEngine;
02 using System.Collections;
03 
04 public class NewScript : MonoBehaviour 
05 {
06 //--------------------------------------------------
07    // Use this for initialization
08    void Start ()
09    {
10       name = "NewObject";
11 }
12    //--------------------------------------------------
13    // Update is called once per frame
14    void Update ()
15    {
16    }
17 }</pre></div><p>The following are the comments for code sample 1-11:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Line 04</strong></span>: The class <code class="literal">NewScript</code> is derived from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>. You can, however, substitute <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code> for almost any valid class name from which you want to derive.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Line 10</strong></span>: Here, the variable name is assigned a string during the <code class="literal">Start</code> event. However, notice that the name is not explicitly declared as a variable anywhere in the <code class="literal">NewScript</code> source file. If <code class="literal">NewScript</code> were a completely new class with <a id="id93" class="indexterm"></a>no ancestor defined in line 04, then line 10 would be invalid. However, because <code class="literal">NewScript</code> derives from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>, it automatically inherits all of its variables, allowing us to access and edit them from <code class="literal">NewScript</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>When to inherit</strong></span>
</p><p>Only use inheritance <a id="id94" class="indexterm"></a>where it's really appropriate; otherwise, you'll make your classes large, heavy, and confusing. If you're creating a class that shares a lot of common functionality with another and it makes sense to establish connection between them, then use inheritance. Another use of inheritance, as we'll see next, is when you want to override specific functions.</p></div></li></ul></div></div>
