The first tip considered Git version control, specifically, how the free and open source version control software allows us to track changes across a project as well as collaborate easily with other developers. The second tip concerned loading file data dynamically, first using internal project files inside a <code class="literal">resources</code> folder and then using AssetBundles. The latter options are especially useful for the creation of external assets that can be edited by both developers and gamers alike. The third and final tip demonstrated how in-game data can be saved to a file and then loaded back through serialization. Through serialization, users can save and restore game data, allowing them to resume playback at a later time.</p></div>
