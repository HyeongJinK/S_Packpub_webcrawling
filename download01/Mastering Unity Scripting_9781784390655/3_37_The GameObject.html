It corresponds most naturally to what we'd call a <span class="emphasis"><em>thing</em></span> in the everyday sense. It doesn't really matter what kind of context-specific behaviors or things you'll actually need inside your own games, because in all<a id="id227" class="indexterm"></a> cases, you'll need <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> to implement them. <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> don't need to be visible to the gamer; they can be, and often are, invisible. Sounds, colliders, and manager classes are some examples of invisible <code class="literal">GameObjects</code>. On the other hand, many <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> will be visible: meshes, animated meshes, sprites, and so on. In all cases, however, whether visible or invisible, the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is instantiated inside a scene as a collection of related components. A <span class="strong"><strong>component</strong></span> is <a id="id228" class="indexterm"></a>essentially a class derived from <code class="literal">MonoBehaviour</code>, and it can be attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> in the scene to change its behavior. Every <code class="literal">GameObject</code> has at least one minimal component in common, and it's impossible to remove it, namely, the <a id="id229" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component (or the RectTransform for GUI objects). This component keeps track of an object's position, rotation, and scale. For example, if you create a blank, empty game object in the scene by going to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span> from the application menu, as shown in the following screenshot, you would end up with a new game <a id="id230" class="indexterm"></a>object in the scene, featuring only a Transform component. Thus, even a new and empty <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is not, strictly speaking, empty, but it's as empty as a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> ever gets. The object still needs a Transform component to maintain its physical location in a scene.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_03_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>All GameObjects feature a Transform component</p></div></div><p>Of course, a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> can have many components, and the behavior of an object arises from the combination and interaction of its components. You can add more premade components to an object using the <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> menu, and you can add your own custom components by dragging-and-dropping your scripts onto an object.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_03_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Components are attached to GameObjects</p></div></div><p>So, <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> are composed of components. At a higher level, scenes are composed of a collection of <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> inside a single world space. Furthermore, objects themselves exist in an<a id="id231" class="indexterm"></a> important relationship with each other, as defined by the scene hierarchy. Objects can be the children of others, who are in turn their parents (<code class="literal">transform.parent</code>). This relationship has important implications for how objects move and transform. In short, values for an object's Transform component will cascade downwards and be added to the transform of all its children. In this way, a child <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is always offset and transformed relative to its parent; the parent position is the origin of the child position. However, if an object has no parent, then it would be transformed away from the world origin at (0, 0, 0). The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_03_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>GameObjects exist in a scene hierarchy that determines their transformations</p></div></div></div>
