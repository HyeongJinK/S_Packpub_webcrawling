Often, they'll be just what you need to set a breakpoint and start debugging! However, there are times when breakpoints, in their default configuration, can become annoying. One example is when a breakpoint is set inside a loop. Sometimes, you only want the breakpoint to take effect or pause execution after a loop has exceeded a specified number of iterations, as opposed to taking effect from the beginning and on every iteration afterwards. By default, a <a id="id217" class="indexterm"></a>breakpoint inside a loop will pause the execution on every iteration, and if the loop is long, such pausing behavior can quickly become tiresome. To resolve this, you can set breakpoint conditions that specify the states that must be true for the<a id="id218" class="indexterm"></a> breakpoint to take effect. To set a breakpoint condition, right-click on the breakpoint and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Breakpoint Properties</strong></span> from the context menu, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_34.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Accessing Breakpoint Properties to set a condition</p></div></div><p>Selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Breakpoint Properties</strong></span> will display the <span class="strong"><strong>Breakpoint Properties</strong></span> dialog where conditions for the breakpoint can be specified. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Condition</strong></span> section, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Break when condition is true</strong></span> option and then use the <span class="strong"><strong>Condition expression</strong></span> field to specify the condition that determines the breakpoint. For loop conditions, the expression <code class="literal">i&gt;5</code> will trigger the breakpoint when the loop iterator has exceeded <code class="literal">5</code>. Of course, the variable <code class="literal">i</code> should be substituted for your own variable names.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784390655/graphics/0655OT_02_35.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Setting conditions for a breakpoint</p></div></div></div>
