One of the most important features that distinguishes it from the previous edition is a new system of global illumination in real time—Enlighten—implemented with the participation of experts from the British company, <span class="emphasis"><em>Geomerics</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399191/graphics/9191OT_03_01.jpg" /></div><p>Unity 5 is presented with support from WebGL standard web module optimization <code class="literal">asm.js</code>, physics engine NVIDIA PhysX 3.3, the system of creation and animation vegetation—SpeedTree, an advanced shader system, the preview function light maps in real time, and a cross-processed audio advertising network in Unity Cloud that facilitates the promotion of mobile games. In addition, the fifth version of the engine will be able to run in a 64-bit environment that significantly simplifies the workflow through a new multi-threaded scheduler, and provides you with the opportunity to make changes in real time and improve the system to create game resources (assets list) and an intuitive interface.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399191/graphics/9191OT_03_02.jpg" /></div><p>The latest version of this <a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a>toolkit, traditionally the best-selling in small teams of developers, is designed including large companies. This makes it a competitor to other high-tech new generation of game engines such as CryEngine and Unreal Engine 4. Along with the fourth generation engine from Epic Games, it has recently signed another agreement with Mozilla, where Unity 5 can be used by developers of three-dimensional and two-dimensional games for browsers and mobile devices.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399191/graphics/9191OT_03_03.jpg" /></div><p>In Unity 5, developers will be able to view the coverage maps in real time using the ray tracing PowerVR from the company <span class="emphasis"><em>Imagination Technologies</em></span>. This technique reduces the processing time, which gives a very good performance. Developers will be able to create a variety of materials from the real world with the new shader system in Unity 5.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Global illumination</strong></span> is <a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a>the name of a series of algorithms used in three-dimensional graphics for more realistic simulation of light. These algorithms take into account not only the direct light from the source (direct illumination), but also reflected light from various surfaces (indirect illumination).</p><p>In theory, <span class="emphasis"><em>reflection</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>refraction</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>shadows</em></span> are examples of global illumination, because for them it is necessary to consider the effect of the simulation of one object to the other (in contrast to the case when the object is exposed to direct light). In practice, however, the simulation of diffuse reflection or caustics is called global illumination.</p><p>Images obtained by the application of global illumination algorithms often appear more realistic than those in the rendering process that apply only direct illumination algorithms. However, to calculate global illumination requires much more time.</p><p>The following figure was processed only by direct illumination algorithms:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399191/graphics/9191OT_03_04.jpg" /></div><p>The following figure was processed by global illumination algorithms:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784399191/graphics/9191OT_03_05.jpg" /></div></div>
