There were a lot of code examples. We learned how to build and import your asset bundles and how to encrypt data for the asset bundle by different methods. Furthermore, in this chapter, we explored how to create and use your <code class="literal">AssetBundle</code> dependencies with other bundles. Also, we studied how to use binary data with asset bundles and executable scripts.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will introduce different optimization techniques. You will learn in practice how to use occlusion culling and level of details optimization techniques. You will see how to optimize native C# and Unity scripts. Finally, you will see how to transform native C# and JavaScript codes into Unity scripts.</p></div>
