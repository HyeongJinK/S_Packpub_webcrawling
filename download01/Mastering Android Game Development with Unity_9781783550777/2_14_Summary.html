Then we learned about managing the camera, and we made the camera follow the penguin throughout the game. Then we worked on Prefabs and created a level block Prefab which we generated in the game from the code to make an endless level generating game. Then we created a Spike Prefab to create an obstacle for the penguin in the game which gets generated randomly and rotates with different speeds at runtime.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will move our concepts of making games to 3D and introduce you to the workflow and systems to create 3D complex games in Unity 3D.</p></div>
