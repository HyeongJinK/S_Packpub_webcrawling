<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec58"></a>Publishing the game</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Open the Android Developer Console, select <strong class="userinput"><code>All Applications</code></strong>, and select the app that you would like to publish. Upload the new APK to the site.</p><p>Next, we have to make sure that all the sections are checked with a green tick mark as we publish the game only after this is done:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_013.png" /></div><p>So select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Store listing</code></strong> link and fill in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Title</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Short Description</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Full Description</code></strong> fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Title</code></strong> field takes the name of the game that will be displayed on the app store, so make sure the name is unique, catchy, and easy to remember.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Short Description</code></strong> is shown on the store as well. The short description is more like a sneak peak into what the game/asp is about. Usually, you will specify the USP of the product telling the reader what makes your game appealing and different from other products. You will also specify the genre of the game here so that if the reader is into that genre then they can read further about it. Once the user clicks the link it will reveal the full description.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Full Description</code></strong> field, you should tell what the game has to offer to the reader. This includes features and a short summary of the story and player motivation, and so on. I have provided a short example in the following screenshot:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_014.png" /></div><p>Scrolling further down we have to provide icons, screenshots, and feature graphics. I really can't emphasize how important the icons and selection of screenshots are to the success of your game.</p><p>Icons need to be on top of our priority list as it is the first thing the user will see once they come across the app. It becomes even more important given the fact that there are tons of apps getting released on the app store on a daily basis. A lot of thought and effort needs to be put into selecting the right kind of icon that can summarize the gist of your game and at the same time is unique enough to differentiate itself from the millions of icons on the app store.</p><p>Once the user is interested in the icon and clicks on it, the next thing that will grab their attention is the screenshots. A minimum of three screenshots need to be uploaded. You can upload more than that. Pick and select the images for your screenshot that complement what you say in the full description. For each bullet point in the feature, provide a screenshot to tell the user what you are offering.</p><p>If you are targeting tablets, add screenshots specially taken on tablets. Also, if you are developing for Android TV and Google Daydream, add screenshots for that as well.</p><p>You can also link a promo video that you have on YouTube. Make sure the video is not more than 30 seconds:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_015.png" /></div><p>Next fill out the details in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Categorization</code></strong> section. Here you will specify if it is an application or a game and what genre. Provide your company website, e-mail address, and submit a privacy policy.</p><p>If you are not submitting a privacy policy, you can uncheck the box under the <strong class="userinput"><code>Privacy Policy</code></strong> section to say that you are not:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_016.png" /></div><p>Once all the information is filled correctly to your satisfaction, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Save Draft</code></strong> button on the top-right corner of the page. Next, let's move on to the content rating section.</p><p>Here you will make sure that the content doesn't include offensive material and the quality of the product is up to the <span class="strong"><strong>International Age Rating Coalition</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IARC</strong></span>) rating standards. IARC is a body that assigns ratings to a given app or mobile games. Click on the Continue button to proceed.</p><p>Fill out your e-mail address, so that if an issue is encountered in the game, IARC can get in touch with you for clarification. Next, select the app category and, in that, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong>.</p><p>Under the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> category, you have to mention that your game doesn't include material pertaining to violence, fear, sexuality, gambling, language, controlled substances, crude humor, and other miscellaneous things. Specify <strong class="userinput"><code>No</code></strong> option for all the items up until Crude Humor, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_017.png" /></div><p>For the <strong class="userinput"><code>MISCELLANEOUS</code></strong> category, we specify <strong class="userinput"><code>No</code></strong> to all items except digital purchase:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_018.png" /></div><p>Since we have in-app purchases, we have to specify <strong class="userinput"><code>Yes</code></strong> for that. Once done, save it by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Save </code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Questionnaire</code></strong> option. Next, click <strong class="userinput"><code>Calculate rating</code></strong> tab, following screen will be displayed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_019.png" /></div><p>You will then get a summary and a rating for the game. The same will also be e-mailed to you at the address provided.</p><p>Next, click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply Rating</code></strong>; you will see that your rating is set. Click on <strong class="userinput"><code>PRICING &amp; DISTRIBUTION</code></strong> and you will see the following window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_020.png" /></div><p>Here, select if you want the app to be free or paid. If you choose for it to be paid, then specify the price that you want to sell the app at.</p><p>Click on all the countries that you want the game to sell in. Clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Available</code></strong> option will select all countries from the list. You can deselect the countries that you don't want the app to be distributed in. Also, at the bottom select that the app contains ads in the <strong class="userinput"><code>CONTAINS ADS</code></strong> field.</p><p>Check the <strong class="userinput"><code>CONSENT</code></strong> check list, shown in the following screenshot, if you approve the app to be promoted outside the Google Play Store, and that the app complies with Android Content Guidelines and US Export laws:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_021.png" /></div><p>Click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Save Draft</code></strong> button on the top-right corner of the screen. We already have specified in-app products, services and APIs, so we don't have to do anything here. But we have to go to Game Services and publish the achievements. So go to <strong class="userinput"><code>Game Services</code></strong> and select the app.</p><p>Provide the detail in <strong class="userinput"><code>Display Name</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Description</code></strong> fields on the main page and upload the icon and feature graphics here as well:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_022.png" /></div><p>Click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Save</code></strong> button on the top-left corner of the window. Next, go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>ACHIEVEMENTS</code></strong> tab, select each achievement, and add the icons:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_023.png" /></div><p>Once you have added icons for all the achievements, you will have the option to publish the game at the top-right corner. Once published, your achievement page will look like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_024.png" /></div><p>Now we can publish the app itself. Go to <strong class="userinput"><code>All Applications</code></strong> and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Manage releases</code></strong>. It will show that you have an app that is ready for production:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_025.png" /></div><p>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Resume</code></strong> button. Add the detail in the <strong class="userinput"><code>RELEASE NAME</code></strong> section and add a description to show what's new in this release:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_026.png" /></div><p>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Review</code></strong> button and then click on<strong class="userinput"><code>Start Rollout to Production</code></strong>. You will be asked to confirm that the app will now be available on the app store:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_027.png" /></div><p>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Confirm</code></strong> button and now it will show you that the app is now pending for publication:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_028.png" /></div><p>It takes about an hour for the app to be published and about three to four hours to be properly visible on the app store. So, be patient. Once it is released, you can distribute the link on social media and tell your friends to download and rate it.</p><p>There is still one small thing to take care of on Facebook. We have to log in to our developer account and enable the PunchyPunch app on Facebook.</p><p>Go to the Facebook developer account and select the app. Now go to <strong class="userinput"><code>App Review</code></strong> tab and under the option saying <strong class="userinput"><code>Make Punchypunch Public</code></strong>, flip the switch to make it public.</p><p>Now the app is public and your friends can share your game:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_029.png" /></div><p>Congratulations! You have successfully developed an Android app on Unity and published it on the Google Play Store.</p></div>
