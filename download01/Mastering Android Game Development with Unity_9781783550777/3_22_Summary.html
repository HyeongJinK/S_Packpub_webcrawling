We discussed how any Unity project is configured for 3D games and how 3D model files are imported in Unity. We also discussed the materials and textures for the 3D models. In order to focus on our fighting action game, we discussed humanoid models or character models and how they are imported. We then discussed the configuration of an avatar for the humanoid models to use in the animation system. Unity offers two kinds of animation systems; legacy and Mecanim. We discussed brief details about legacy as it has been deprecated in Unity now followed by a more detailed discussion on the Mecanim animation system. We imported a few animations and worked to create a simple animation controller alongside a simple parameter to control the flow of the animations.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will continue from the controller and create a detailed animation controller with lots of animations and parameters, which will be used for both player and enemy characters. We will then control the player movement and animations using virtual joystick controls and discuss a little about artificial intelligence behind enemy characters.</p></div>
