For 3D projects, the procedure is almost identical, except some changes need to be done. Let's start by launching Unity 5 and creating an empty project with it.</p><p>If you are already aware of 3D game projects configuration or have worked on any 3D game before, you can safely skip this section. When you launch Unity 5, it shows a project wizard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_002.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.2 Unity 5 new project wizard</p><p>The project wizard shows a list of all the recent projects along with their names. The most recent project is highlighted for quick opening. On the top-right side of the wizard, there are controls to create a new project from scratch and open any specific project from any directory. Let's start by creating a new project by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>New project</code></strong> button on the top right. You will be presented with the dialog, shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_003.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.3 New project details wizard</p><p>Write the project name and select its path location. Below these text inputs, you will observe a simple selection from two options: 2D and 3D. We will choose 3D as we are creating a 3D game. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_004.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.4 Project type selector for 2D and 3D</p><p>This toggle lets you tell Unity whether your project is 2D or 3D. Although this doesn't affect or change the project in any way while working on it, it affects the default project setting for an easier workflow. For example, in 3D mode when you import any image asset into the project, Unity will take it as a texture and in 2D mode, Unity will take it as a sprite. You can also change the mode later from the project anytime; it is not necessary to select at project creation time. By default, Unity will create the project in 3D mode.</p><p>Now, let's name the project as <strong class="userinput"><code>Free Fighter</code></strong> and press <strong class="userinput"><code>Create Project</code></strong>. This will import some pre-defined assets and launch the Unity interface editor. You can observe that an empty new scene will be created as well containing two game objects in the hierarchy panel: <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong>. We won't discuss these objects at the moment, but these will be covered in upcoming chapters as we manage the cameras and lights for the games.</p><p>In this blank unsaved empty scene, the first thing we need is the model of the player character. Let's discuss the model or models in general in the next section.</p></div>
