Drag and drop the buttons into a folder called <code class="literal">buttons</code>.</p><p>It is also a good time to start organizing your folders a bit. For the sake of convenience and personal sanity, it is better to put assets into folders:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_06_005.png" /></div><p>I have created folders structure with the following folders:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>3dAssets</code></strong>: Contains player FBX, You can also add other 3D objects, like a 3D environment, and 3D meshes.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>animController</code></strong>: I have placed Animation Controllers here. When you have lot of enemies, you will probably have separate Animation Controllers for each, so it is better to also have a separate controller for each.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>buttons</code></strong>: Sprites for buttons can go in here.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Fonts</code></strong>: Although Arial is a beautiful font, you might want to choose a font that it is more suitable to your game. So, create a folder to put these here.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Materials</code></strong>: Once again, more objects mean more materials, so get organized!</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>prefabs</code></strong>: Put all prefabs in a separate folder so that they are easier to access.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Scenes</code></strong>: Scenes are the most accessed files when creating a game, so keep them in a separate folders for easy access.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Scripts</code></strong>: Overtime, you might use a lot of scripts for different things so create separate folders for these as well.</li></ul></div><p>When you open the <strong class="userinput"><code>buttons</code></strong> folder, it looks like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_06_006.png" /></div><p>The button images all have a small arrow on their right-hand edge. That is because they have already been converted to Sprite types. To convert an image to sprite, select the image and in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> pane, and change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Texture Type</code></strong> field to <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite (2D and UI)</code></strong> option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_06_007.png" /></div><p>Do the same for all the buttons in the buttons folder.</p></div>
