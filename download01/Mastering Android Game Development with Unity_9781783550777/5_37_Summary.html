We also added a very basic particle system just to demonstrate the ability to add particles. You can go in and change the particle system to see what more can be done.</p><p>The gameplay is over, and next, we can see how to add in scenes to the game, so we will create a main menu scene, which will show at the start of the game. We will also see how to add buttons so that at the click of the play button, the scene will swap to the gameplay scene.</p></div>
