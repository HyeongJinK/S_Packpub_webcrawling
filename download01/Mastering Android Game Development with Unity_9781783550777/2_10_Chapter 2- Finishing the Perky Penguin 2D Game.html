As this book is focused on game development for the Android platform, so the previous chapter, which happens to be the very first chapter of the book, introduced the Android platform, its different versions, and its marketplace, Google Play. Then the chapter revised the concepts of game engines and then brought Unity 3D into light by comparing it with other major game engines such as Unreal, Adobe Flash, and Game Maker Studio. The chapter made a transition through the very basics of Unity game development, such as introducing Unity's interface, its panels, such as the inspector panel, the hierarchy panel, and so on. It also introduced the concepts of scene view and game view and how they interact with each other and how these views help developers to make it an easy and fun experience to create awesome games.</p><p>This chapter includes the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding particle systems to a game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Camera management</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Prefabs and level management</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Lasers and enemies in a game</li></ul></div><p>After providing enough information on the theoretical side of unity game development for Android platforms, the previous chapter started practical examples from configuring empty game projects which are especially useful for 2D games. Configuring empty projects is the very first step in any game and we covered this in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Introduction to Android Game Development with Unity 3D</em></span>, in a very practical manner, and we also introduced a 2D game called <span class="strong"><strong>Perky Penguin</strong></span>. The following is the screenshot of the game from the previous chapter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_02_001.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.1 Perky Penguin game</p><p>We learned how a player, such as the penguin, is added in Unity and how the colliders and physics were applied on the penguin. Unity also supports scripting and programming in C# or JavaScript languages to define custom behaviors such as making the penguin jump, avoiding gravity while flying, stopping the penguin from leaving the screen during gameplay, and so on. The chapter finished by having a Perky Penguin game with a penguin jumping in it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are already familiar with the 2D concepts of Unity or have created 2D games already, then you can skip this chapter and move on to the third dimension.</p></div><p>In this chapter, we will finish this Penguin Perky game by learning some other advanced concepts of Unity 2D, such as adding particle effects, camera management, creating levels, using animations and controllers introduced in Unity 4.x versions, and so on. Until now, the Perky Penguin game has a cute penguin that can fly and jump on the screen but it can't walk forward and neither can it explore the game world. One thing to note here is that how the penguin is flying, whereas in real life, penguins don't fly. In our game, the penguin has got its hands on a red rocket which gives a boost of fire on the penguin to make it fly for a little instant. In the game, this boost is applied by a single tap on the screen of an Android device.</p><p>In the next section, we will start work on our game and bring the game to life by adding particle effects.</p></div>
