<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec26"></a>Importing the player model</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>First, make sure you create a new Unity 3D project. This is not like the first project we created as this is going to be a 3D project, not a 2D project.</p><p>Once you've created the project, you will find the <code class="literal">Dude.FBX</code> file in the assets for this chapter, so drag and drop the file into the Unity project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_001.png" /></div><p>In your case the model will be gray, not red as shown here. To make it red, double-click on the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder. You will see the <code class="literal">01- Default</code> file. When you select it, you'll will get an option to change the color of the object. Click on the gray box next to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Albedo</code></strong> option in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel and select a red color to change the color of the character:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_002.png" /></div><p>The next thing that needs to be done by us is to create animation clips for all the animations that we have in the game. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Dude</code></strong> character in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder of the project. Now look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> pane. In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> pane you will see three tabs called <strong class="userinput"><code>Model</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Rig</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Animations</code></strong>, as shown in the following screenshot. Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Animations</code></strong> tab:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_003.png" /></div><p>This shows all the animation clips that currently exist. As of now, there is only one animation clip, called <code class="literal">Take 001</code>, that starts at 0 and ends at 80 frames. You can even preview the animation by clicking on the play button at the bottom of the panel.</p><p>You will see that <code class="literal">Take 001</code> has all the animations that were imported, along with the FBX file, and it has the idle, guard, punch and get hit animations. Since all the animations are in a single clip, we have to break up the animations into individual clips.</p><p>To do that, first we extract the <strong class="userinput"><code>idle</code></strong> clip which runs from frame 0 to frame 29. So, we change the name to <strong class="userinput"><code>idle</code></strong> and set the end frame to 29 for the animation clip as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_004.png" /></div><p>Make sure to click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong> button at the bottom for the changes to take effect.</p><p>Also, observe that the <strong class="userinput"><code>Loop Time</code></strong> checkbox is ticked. This is because the animation has to be looped so if we don't check this box, then the animation will just play once and stop.</p><p>Now let's extract the second animation clip which is the <code class="literal">guard</code>/<code class="literal">defend</code> animation. For this click on the + icon in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Clips</code></strong> menu. This will create a default animation called <code class="literal">Take 001</code> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_005.png" /></div><p>Now, once again, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Take 001</code></strong> clip, rename it to <strong class="userinput"><code>defend</code></strong>, and change the start and end time to <strong class="userinput"><code>32</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>49</code></strong>. Click <strong class="userinput"><code>Loop Time</code></strong> and click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong> button at the end:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_006.png" /></div><p>Now add the animation clip for <span class="strong"><strong>punch</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>getHit</strong></span> animations as well. The <strong class="userinput"><code>punch</code></strong> animation starts from 51 and ends at 60 and the <strong class="userinput"><code>getHit</code></strong> animation starts at 71 and ends at 75.</p><p>For these animations, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Loop Time</code></strong> option doesn't need to be checked as they don't need to loop. Once you have all the required animations, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Clips</code></strong> window should look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_04_007.png" /></div><p>Once we have finished extracting the animations, we can create the Animation Controller for the player character.</p></div>
