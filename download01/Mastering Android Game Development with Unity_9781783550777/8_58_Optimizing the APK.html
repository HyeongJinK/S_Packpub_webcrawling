Click on the small down arrow on the top-right of the console and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Open Editor Log</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_006.png" /></div><p>This will open a text file with the log information. Scroll down in the text file to where it shows the size of the individual files. As you can see, Unity already does a good job of removing assets that are not being used in the current game.</p><p>It also breaks down the assets and shows which of the assets are contributing to the size. Here we see that the <code class="literal">menuImage.jpg</code>, <code class="literal">ground.jpg</code>, and <code class="literal">wall.jpg</code> images are quite big in size:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_08_007.png" /></div><p>One of the popular tools for reducing the size of a JPEG is <span class="strong"><strong>Paint.NET</strong></span>; it is a free application to reduce the file size. You can download the tool from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.getpaint.net/index.html</a>.</p><p>Similarly, for of PNG images, you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>PNG Crush</strong></span> tool to reduce the size of the image. It can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush" target="_blank">https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush</a>.</p><p>On the whole, it is recommended to use vector art as much as possible instead of raster images as the image quality will be crisp irrespective of the resolution and it will also save space for optimization purposes.</p></div>
