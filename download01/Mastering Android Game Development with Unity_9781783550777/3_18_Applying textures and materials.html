The 3D modeling tools give quite a lot of flexibility to modelers and designers to work together and create amazing textures and convert them from simple images to 3D working models. Looking from a graphics and designing perspective, there are three components to materialize the model: textures, shaders, and materials. Unity3D gives lot of options to customize these three parts and lets developers create exactly what they want that model to look like. These three components are connected in such a way that developers can easily change and alter each component individually and see its results on the model in real-time. The following figure shows the connection of these three components:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_013.jpg" /></div><p>Figure 3.13 Connection between textures, shades, and materials</p><p>You can see in the preceding figure that textures are not directly applied on the model. Instead, they are applied on the materials and the materials are then applied on the model. Materials also add some materializing properties in order to behave with the lights present in the scene to make the model look 3D in the 2D world of the computer screen. Let's give a little detail to each component in the following sub-sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"></a>Textures</h3></div></div></div><p>Generally, the mesh object gives a rough approximation of the shape of the model and how it will look like, but it's the textures that define the shape itself and present it in a real form from the perspective of the viewer. Textures are the flat bitmap images that are wrapped on the model mesh surface. The easiest example would be to think of them as the image that is printed on any 3D model, such as any cylinder or cube or any complex model such as our farmhouse.</p><p>The following figure shows this scenario:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_014.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.14 Texture on 3D model</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec5"></a>Texture Importer</h4></div></div></div><p>All the texture exist in the <code class="literal">Project</code> folder in the image form. Unity gives to change the type of texture--after importing a texture you just select texture from the project panel and modify from the topmost item in the inspector. That allows you to select the type of texture you want to create from the source image file. All the types of texture are shown in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_051.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec6"></a>Applying texture in shaders</h4></div></div></div><p>The shaders you use for your objects put specific requirements on which textures you need, but the basic principle is that you can put any image file inside your project. If it meets the size requirements (specified in the following text), it will get imported and optimized.</p><p>There are certain steps to put texture in shaders:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>After selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Model</code></strong>, shaders will be visible in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel.</li><li><strong class="userinput"><code>Texture</code></strong> button is present in it, click on it for applying texture.</li><li>Select Texture, so that our 3D model will be wrapped in our selected texture.</li></ol></div><p>This is represented in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_052.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"></a>Note</h3><p>Unity can read the following file formats for texture PSD, TIFF, JPG, TGA, PNG, GIF, BMP, IFF, and PICT. It should be noted that Unity can import multi-layer PSD and TIFF files.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"></a>Shaders</h3></div></div></div><p>In computer graphics, shaders are a little hard to understand for newbies. A texture tells the viewer of what is drawn on the surface and mesh of the 3D model object, but it is the shader that tells how that texture is drawn. As we saw earlier in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.13</em></span>, a material is a mixture of textures and shaders. A material contains the properties and textures, and a shader tells us which properties and shaders a material can have. Let's take an example to understand this concept better. Imagine you have a piece of wood. The shape of the piece is the mesh object of the 3D model. And the color, wooden pattern, and other visible elements on the shape are the textures of the 3D model. Now if you drop that wooden piece in the water, then it will look a little different than the original wooden piece. Note that it is still the same mesh with the same textures, but it will look different when it is dropped in the water. That difference in the visibility is defined by the shader in Unity3D. The water is the shader in this example. We will discuss about how these are made and applied in Unity3D later in this book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec35"></a>Materials</h3></div></div></div><p>In simple terms, materials define how a surface should be rendered in computer graphics. It is not just a container of textures and shaders. Rather it comes with many different properties which vary on the shader itself and gets the reference of the textures to further define the final visibility of the model itself. The following figure shows the difference in two materials with different shaders:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_015.jpg" /></div><p>Figure 3.15 Materials with different shaders in Unity</p><p>Note the little shine in the left-side material. The reason for this is the specular shader and the right-side material is using the diffuse shader. Both have common properties such as color, base texture, and so on. Unity comes with a lot of built-in shaders, and you can also write your own custom shaders to further polish and define the look of the model.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec36"></a>Applying textures on a farmhouse model</h3></div></div></div><p>So far, we have given an overview of textures, shaders, and materials, and how they are all connected with each other. But, don't forget that we have an imported model of the farmhouse in our scene which appears in the shade of a white and gray color. Now, we have to apply texture on it and create a material for the model. Unity provides a very easy and convenient way of applying textures on the models.</p><p>Create a new folder called <code class="literal">Textures</code> in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder, and load the image shown in the following figure in that folder by using the normal file explorer or dragging the image into the folder in Unity3D:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_016.jpg" /></div><p>Figure 3.16 Farmhouse model texture</p><p>Once it is imported in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder, you have to apply it on the model placed in the Scene view. Drag the texture from the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder and drop it on the model in the Scene view and Unity will automatically create a material and do the rendering stuff for you. You can then further customize it according to your requirements. The following figure shows the process of applying textures on the material:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_017.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.17 Farmhouse model texture</p><p>After applying the texture, you will observe that the farmhouse will be in the color form and will look much more realistic now. The following figure shows the simple comparison between before texture and after texture of the farmhouse model and its properties in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_018.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.18 Comparison between before texture and after texture</p><p>Note that before texture, Unity3D has applied a default texture of the farmhouse texture with the standard shader on the model, which makes it look like a white color. While after texture is applied, Unity puts a numbered name of the texture (called <span class="strong"><strong>Farmhouse Texture 6</strong></span> in the image). Refer to the label number 1 in the preceding figure for the shader. You can also note that the Albedo property (labelled as number 2 in the figure) was empty before but now it is filled with our texture image. You can also apply texture by clicking on the little square shape on the side of Albedo. It will open a popup of the <code class="literal">Assets</code> explorer panel, through which you can select your required texture from Assets and it will be applied on the model.</p></div></div>
