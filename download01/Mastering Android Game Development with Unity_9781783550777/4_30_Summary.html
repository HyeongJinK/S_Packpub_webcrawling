We created an Animation Controller and transitions between animations. Once the animations controller had been created, we then controlled the animation using the code.</p><p>We also created player controls, created a very basic AI, and controlled the AI behavior with a pattern which we randomized to avoid pattern repetition.</p><p>Now that we have a basic skeleton to work with, we will improve this and add a proper game loop in the next chapter.</p></div>
