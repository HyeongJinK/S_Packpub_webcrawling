We see particles in the form of dust, clouds, rain, and also in the form of the celebration that happens at the end of the game. They can really be whatever you plan to make of them. For the purpose of our game, we are going to add confetti at the gameover.</p><p>A particle system in Unity is also a game object, so to create a particle system, go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>GameObject</code></strong> menu and select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Particle System</code></strong> option:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_018.png" /></div><p>Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key on the keyboard to highlight the <strong class="userinput"><code>Particle System</code></strong> option as it might be created away from the main camera. In my case, it was created at 900, 300, and -26. Don't worry about the positioning of the particle. We will manually change where we want the particle to be created at the end when we want it to be spawned.</p><p>Once you zoom in on the Particle System, you will see a cone shape and see particles coming out of the shape. The cone specifies the shape of the emitter, and the white particles are the actual particles that are emitted from the Particle System. This is represented by the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_019.png" /></div><p>Like any game object, you will also see three arrows that let you position the particle system. You also need to press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span> keys to position, rotate, and scale the size of the emitter, respectively.</p><p>Once you select <strong class="userinput"><code>Particle System</code></strong> in the Hierarchy, it will show how the particles will be created in the scene. If you select some other object or deselect the Particle System, the animation stops. So, if you would like to preview how the particles are getting created, then select the Particle System in the Hierarchy to get a preview of it.</p><p>Let's see some of the important parameters that you can modify in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> pane for the Particle System:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_020.png" /></div><p>Like all other game objects, you can position, rotate, and scale the Particle System, the first set of parameters are as shown in the following screenshot. These parameters control how the particles are initially created:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_021.png" /></div><p>A brief description of all the parameters is given here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Duration</code></strong>: This specifies for how long initially the particles are created. By default, it is set to 5 seconds. At present, you won't see a difference as looping is enabled. If you disable looping, then if you select <strong class="userinput"><code>Particle System</code></strong> in the Hierarchy, you will see that the particles emit for 5 seconds and then stop.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Looping</code></strong>: This should be disabled if you don't want the particles to be spawned continuously. So, if you want a burst of particles, disable looping.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Prewarm</code></strong>: This parameter loads the particles beforehand so that it won't look as if the particles are getting generated at the start of the scene. For example, if you have a water fall particle system and when the scene loads, it should look as if the water fall was running before the scene was loaded. If the waterfall starts to form just after the scene was loaded, it won't look practical.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Delay</code></strong>: You can set the particles form after a delay in using this parameter. Right now the particles start forming right after you click the particle system in the hierarchy, but if you want the particles to be formed a second after, then you will type <code class="literal">1.0</code> and the particles will form a second after you click the Particle System.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Lifetime</code></strong>: Each particle lasts for a certain period of time and then it gets deleted from the scene. By default, the particle is always set to be deleted after 5 seconds. If you want the particle to last longer in the scene, this parameter can be changed to cater to your needs.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Speed</code></strong>: This is the initial speed of each particle. By default, this is also set to 5.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Size</code></strong>: This is the initial size of the particle. By default, it is set to 1. It is the particle object in the initial size that it was created. If you created particles bigger and you would like to reduce the size by half, you will type in 0.5.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Rotation</code></strong>: If you want the particles to be generated at an angle in which they were created, then you can set the angle here.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Randomize Rotation</code></strong>: If you want the particles to be created at different angles, then you can specify the angle here. Unlike start rotation, which would create all the particles at the same angle, randomize rotation will create each particle at a different angle.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Color</code></strong>: This specifies the initial color in which each of the particles is created. By default, it is set to white. You can change the color by clicking on the white bar and specifying the color.</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_022.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Gravity Modifier</code></strong>: This enables gravity. By default, the value is set to 0, meaning that there is no gravity. If you set the value to 1, you have enabled gravity to the maximum. You can also set the value to between zero and one for an appropriate gravity level as you desire.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Simulation Space</code></strong>: This specifies all the changes that are made after the each particle locally; that is, with respect to the origin of individual particle. By default, set it to local.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Simulation Speed</code></strong>: This specifies the speed at which the simulation is calculated. You can speed up or slow down the simulation. This is useful to see how your particles will behave if you have a particle system that takes time to mature.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Scale Mode</code></strong>: Set this to local. This specifies that the scale affects each particle with respect to the particle's origin and not the origin of the emitter or the world.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Play on Awake</code></strong>: The particles system becomes active as soon as the scene starts. If you don't wish the particle to start immediately at the start of the scene, then you need to uncheck this parameter.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Max Particles</code></strong>: This is the maximum number of particles that can be present in the scene at a time. By default, set it to 1,000. This should be kept as minimum as possible as it would significantly reduce the performance of the game, because the more particles you have in the scene, the more render calls are required and more calculation is required for each particle.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Auto Random</code></strong>: Seed generates a seed to automatically randomize the spawn and movement of each of the particle.</li></ul></div><p>The next set of parameters is optional and requires checking and unchecking if you would like to enable or disable these features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Emission</code></strong>: This specifies the amount of particles getting generated in a second. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Rate over Time</code></strong> option is set to 10, meaning there are 10 particles generated in a span of 1 second. If you set it to 1, then you will see 1 particle each second. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Rate over Distance</code></strong> option will work only when World Space Simulation is used. In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Bursts</code></strong> mode, you can create a burst of particle depending on the duration that you initially set. So, here, when you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> icon, it will create 30 particles every 5 seconds:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_023.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Shape</code></strong>: This specifies the shape of the particle system itself. By default, it is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>Cone</code></strong>. Since the Particle System is the shape of the cone, you can see that the particles are generated and move upward in the specified shape. If you want the particle to spread in all directions, then you can specify sphere. You can also select between box, mesh, circle, and edge. By selecting mesh, you can specify a certain mesh and let the particle be generated from that specified mesh shape.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">There are other parameters as well, such as angle, radius.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Emit from:</code></strong> This specifies from where the particles will be generated from, such as Base, Base Shell, Volume, and Volume Shell.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">You can also randomize the direction or align to a specific direction:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_024.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Velocity over Lifetime</code></strong>: If you would like the velocity to be changed over time, then you can specify here. If not specified, then the speed would be kept constant, and it would be the same that was set initially.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Limit velocity Over Lifetime</code></strong>: This can limit the speed of the particle so that once the particle has reached a specific speed over lifetime, it is set either to that speed or slowly reduces over time to the initial speed set.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Inherit Velocity</code></strong>: This controls the speed of the particle depending on the speed of the emitter itself. The faster the emitter moves, the faster the particles are.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Force Over Lifetime</code></strong>: This sets the force of each particle over the lifetime. So, the particle will move faster over a period of time if this value is set.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Color Over Lifetime</code></strong>: The color of each particle can be changed depending on when it was generated.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Color by Speed</code></strong>: The color of each particle is specified by the speed of the particle itself.</li></ul></div><p>Similarly, we have size and rotation, which are either controlled by what stage they are in their lifetime or the speed at which they are moving:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>External Force</code></strong>: You can simulate the exertion of external force on the particle by changing the multiplier on the external force, for example, the case of wind.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Noise</code></strong>: You can also generate randomness using noise, which will use perlin noise-like texture to create random movement and behavior of the particles:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_025.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Collision</code></strong>: The particles as of yet won't react to other objects in the scene, so if you place an object in from of the particle, the particle would just go through the object. When you enable collision, the particle will collide with the object instead of going through it:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_026.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Triggers</code></strong>: Particles can also be used as triggers if the <strong class="userinput"><code>Triggers</code></strong> option setting is turned on:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_027.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Sub Emitter</code></strong>: Each particle can also emit objects when you enable the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sub Emitter</code></strong> option. Also, each particle will also emit other particles.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Texture Sheet Animation</code></strong>: Instead of static images, you can also specify a texture sheet so that each particle is animated instead of displaying a static image:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_028.png" /></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Lights and Trils</code></strong>: Each particle can also have a light source and trails attached to them to make the scene more eye catching and pretty.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Renderer</code></strong>: This specifies a lot of parameters like the shape of the particle itself, if it needs to be a billboard or a mesh. So, in a mesh, you can specify 3D objects such as a box, sphere, cone, and the normal direction of the particle and the material.</li></ul></div><p>You can specify the sort mode, minimum and maximum particle size, alignment, and pivot. Each particle and cast receiving shadows has light probes, reflects light probes, and so on:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_05_029.png" /></div></div>
