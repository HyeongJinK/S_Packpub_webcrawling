The chapter continued the practice example of the game from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Android Game Development with Unity3D</em></span>, and finished by covering important topics on 2D games. It started by adding particle effects in Unity and then it explained in detail about the concept of Particle Systems, the basics of Particle Systems, and how these are added in Unity. Then we continued the discussion to apply the concepts in a practical example by adding a rocket fire particle system for the penguin in the game, and discussed such properties as emission, shape, and color.</p><p>After Particle Systems, the chapter focused on creating an environment and adding backgrounds in the game. It explained how to import these backgrounds, and how to make them repeatable in the game. The concept of sorting layers and tags was also covered and the chapter moved on to camera management and how a penguin would never go out of the screen if the camera always focused on it.</p><p>After these regular topics, a very interesting and useful topic of Prefabs was discussed in the chapter. After some basic discussion of Prefabs, the game was enlightened with Level Prefabs, which allowed the game to repeat the background and generate obstacles at runtime. This discussion also included the generator concept and its code implementation as well.</p><p>Finally, the chapter finished with adding obstacles in the game and the basic collision detection with the penguin. This led to the concept of triggers as well, which becomes very useful in creating invisible colliders to detect some object's presence at some place in the game. The following is a screenshot of the game after completion of the previous chapter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783550777/graphics/image_03_001.png" /></div><p>Figure 3.1 A snapshot of Penguin Perky game</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are interested in creating any 2D game in Unity, then this is covered in more detail in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Android Game Development with Unity3D</em></span> and <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finishing the Perky Penguin 2D Game</em></span>.</p></div><p>This chapter is a totally new level compared to previous chapters. In this chapter, we will extend our knowledge about Unity to 3D game development, which can often become very confusing and tricky for new game developers. Up until 2D game development, the focus of developers and programmers revolved around the concept of images, sprites, and two dimensions, ignoring the camera's depth. The new developers who have worked on graphics tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp prove to be very good in 2D game development and grasp the concepts very quickly, but 3D becomes very tough because it needs expertise in highly-used advanced commercial tools such as Autodesk Maya, 3D Studio Max, and so on. These tools require many years of practice and experience and that makes 3D game development very hard to learn for new programmers.</p><p>It is out of the scope of this book to cover all the topics, but we will learn about basic concepts and their usage through creating a 3D action fighting game from scratch. This chapter will teach from the very start about the configuration of 3D game projects, importing 3D models, and how textures and materials are applied on these models. Moving on, this chapter will introduce the concept of rigging and what interfaces Unity has to offer to make rigging easier, such as humanoid rigging, generic rigging, and so on. This concept of rigging will be implemented in practice by importing and rigging the player character model of the action fighting game in Unity. We will further apply animations to allow for basic character movement.</p><p>Now, let's put our words into action and start learning about 3D game development, focusing on the configuration of 3D game projects in Unity in the following section.</p><p>This chapter includes the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring a project for 3D games</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing 3D models</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Applying textures and materials</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Generic and humanoid rigs</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring humanoid avatars</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Legacy and Mecanim animation systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">State machines with Animation controllers</li></ul></div></div>
