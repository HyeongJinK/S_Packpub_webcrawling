In this chapter, we will put that knowledge to use and start making a fighting game with basic control scheme.</p><p>We will import the player character first and set the different animation frames required for the different animations for the fighting like idle, punch, block, and get hit. We will also be creating the different states using the Animation Controller. Animation Controller let us decide the animation flow based on the behavior of the character.</p><p>We will also be looking at game balancing and how to be fair to the player. If the game is unfair, the player will get frustrated and quit the game and will not recommend the game to anyone.</p><p>We will be implementing controls using mouse and keyboard but, in a later chapter, we will see how to implement touch controls for handheld devices.</p><p>At the end of the chapter we will have a basic fighting system in which we get to hit the enemy and the enemy will take hits or block our attack.</p><p>This chapter includes the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing player model</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating player using Animation Controller</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scripting player controls</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding enemy character</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Enemy behavior and AI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Finalizing the fight</li></ul></div><p> </p><p> </p></div>
