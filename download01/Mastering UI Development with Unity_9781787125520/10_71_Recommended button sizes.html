Buttons that are a reasonable size on a PC or console game may be too small for a mobile game.</p><p>Apple, Google, and Microsoft all have specific recommendations for the size of a button's touchable area when designing for their devices: Apple recommends that buttons be 44 points x 44 points; Google recommends 48 dp x 48 dp with 8 dp spacing between two more buttons; and Microsoft recommends 9 mm x 9 mm with 2 mm padding between two buttons. Annoyingly, all of these recommendations are in different units of measurement.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note99"></a>Note</h3><p>You can find information about designing touch/hit areas for each mobile platform at the following locations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Apple: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/</a></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Google: <a class="ulink" href="https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-touch-target-size" target="_blank">https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-touch-target-size</a></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Microsoft: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/guidelines-for-targeting" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/guidelines-for-targeting</a></li></ul></div></div><p>But, what do these numbers even mean in terms of design? How do you make sure your buttons are 9 mm x 9 mm or 44 points x 44 points? And why are they talking about these measurements in different units? It's almost like they are all competitors and don't want to work nicely together! To answer these questions, let's first look at <span>what</span><a id="id325601400" class="indexterm"></a> the various units of measurement represent:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A <span class="strong"><strong>point</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>pt</strong></span>) is <span>used</span><a id="id325606612" class="indexterm"></a> to measure what represents a physical measurement on a screen. 1 point is 1/72 of an international inch, or 0.3528 mm. It is primarily used in typography and print media. When working with a program such as Illustrator, creating an object in points and then exporting your image at 72 ppi makes pixels and points the same size. <span class="strong"><strong>Points and pixels are not the same, except when exporting at 72 ppi.</strong></span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Density-independent pixels</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>dp</strong></span>) is a unit of measurement that is created to maintain consistently sized items on screens with different dpi (dots per inch). A density-independent pixel measures the <span>size</span><a id="id325606631" class="indexterm"></a> of 1 pixel on a 160 dpi screen. Using this conversion is like saying: it would appear at this size on a 160 dpi screen, it should appear the exact same physical size on any other screen. You can read more about density-independent pixels here: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#range" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#range</a>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When <span class="strong"><strong>millimeters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>mm</strong></span>) are used to <span>describe</span><a id="id325606652" class="indexterm"></a> a button size, the size is a physical representation of the button on the screen. So, if you were to take a ruler and hold it up to the screen, it would be consistent with this unit of measurement.</li></ul></div><p>OK, so they all represent some physical unit of measurement on the screen. That makes things a little easier. Let's convert all of these values to millimeters so we can compare them in a unit of measurement that is a bit easier to conceptualize. I'm also going to convert them to points, since you can use points in a program, such as Illustrator, to create your button art.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip100"></a>Note</h3><p>If you need to convert any of these units of measurement, and you're not too keen on the idea of doing math, googling <span class="emphasis"><em>convert points to mm</em></span> will bring up a nice conversion calculator for you. You can also use the following converter tool. It is really handy to bounce between all of the different units of measurement: <a class="ulink" href="http://angrytools.com/android/pixelcalc/" target="_blank">http://angrytools.com/android/pixelcalc/.</a></p></div><p>In the following chart, I rounded to the nearest integer the measurement for points, and to the nearest tenth for millimeters, to make things easier. We can use this image as a way to compare the different sizes (the image has been scaled and the sizes may not translate to their real-world measurements):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/71815bab-19e8-4bdc-b3cb-56f2a225ca8c.png" /></div><p>So, which size should you use? It's up to you. You don't have to use their recommendations, but I personally go with the Apple recommendation <span>since</span><a id="id325611019" class="indexterm"></a> it is the largest and therefore meets the recommendations of the other two.</p><p>Another consideration is whether your game will be played with thumbs or with fingers. If the game will be played with thumbs, you'll want bigger buttons, because thumbs are bigger! The numbers described previously are minimum recommendations so they would be used for a finger tap, not a thumb tab.</p><p>So, how do you ensure that your buttons are always the size you want in your game? The <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas Scaler</code></strong> component! Remember from <a class="ulink" href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/mastering_unity_ui_development/wp-admin/post.php?post=27&amp;action=edit" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Canvases, Panels, and Basic Layouts,</em></span> we discussed ensuring a button of a specified size regardless of resolution, can be achieved by setting the <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas Scaler</code></strong> component's <strong class="userinput"><code>UI Scale Mode</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Constant Physical Size</code></strong>. You have the option to have your Canvas's measurement units be in millimeters or points (as well as a few other units).  </p><p>My recommendation when designing for <span>mobile</span><a id="id325620674" class="indexterm"></a> devices is to have multiple devices on hand to test at various resolutions. Play the game and see how it feels to you. Ask people with smaller and larger hands than yours to play. Even after following the minimum guidelines specified by the various mobile platforms, you may still find your buttons are too small for what you need.</p><p>Google and Microsoft also specify visible sizes that they recommend, so you can have a smaller button image as long as the button's hit area is the recommended size. If you want a button that is smaller visually, but has a larger hit area, instead of attaching the button component to the tiny piece of art, attach it to a larger parent hit area and change the target image of the button to the tiny art.</p></div>
