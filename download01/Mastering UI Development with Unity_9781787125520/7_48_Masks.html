If an object is affected by a mask, any part of it outside the mask's restricted area will be invisible. The restriction area of a mask can either be determined by an image with the <span>Mask</span><a id="id325368569" class="indexterm"></a> component or a Rect Transform with the Rect Mask 2D component.</p><p>With UI, masking is primarily used for scrolling menus, so items that exist outside of the menu's area will not be visible. However, it is also used to <span class="emphasis"><em>cut out</em></span> images. For example, the following image shows a cat's image being cut out by a circular mask:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/728f120c-a210-4e9f-a287-dfb6f7adfdbe.png" /></div><p>Circular Mask Example in the Chapter7Text Scene</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip59"></a>Note</h3><p>You may note that the edges on the cat with mask don't look great. To avoid this, ensure that you use sprites with appropriate image resolutions and try different Filtering modes on the Sprite's <strong class="userinput"><code>Import Settings</code></strong>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec72"></a>Mask component</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Mask</span><a id="id325606641" class="indexterm"></a></code></strong> component can be added to any UI object with an Image component. If its added to a UI object that doesn't have an <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> component, it won't function, since it needs an Image to determine the restricted area.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Mask</code></strong> component can be added to a UI Object by selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Mask</code></strong> within the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/33c94362-e9e2-49cf-b7b5-43f6f6701d6c.png" /></div><p>Any children of the UI Object containing the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mask</code></strong> component will then have their visibility restricted to only the area within the opaque area of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> on its Image component.</p><p>In the following image, the object named <code class="literal">Mask</code> is a UI Image with a <strong class="userinput"><code>Mask</code></strong> component added to it. As you can see, the purple triangle on the left of the panel is only partially visible, while the green triangle on the right is fully visible. The green triangle is fully visible, because it is not a child of the UI Image that contains a <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Mask</span><a id="id325611030" class="indexterm"></a></code></strong> component:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/01b6c414-3344-4fc4-a478-25548611d870.png" /></div><p>Mask Component Example in the Chapter7Text Scene</p><p>You have the option to hide the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> that is defining the Mask component's visibility area. If you deselect <strong class="userinput"><code>Show Mask Graphic</code></strong>, the parent's source image will not be visible. It's important to note that changing the opacity on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> does not affect the Mask's functionality.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec73"></a>Rect Mask 2D component</h3></div></div></div><p>Using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Mask</code></strong> component allows you to restrict the visible area to a non-rectangular shape. However, if you want to restrict the visible <span>area</span><a id="id325620691" class="indexterm"></a> to a rectangular shape and don't want to use an image to restrict the visible area, you can use a Rect Mask 2D component.</p><p>The Rect Mask 2D component can be added to a UI Object by selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Rect Mask 2D</code></strong> within the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/e67b5fa5-8532-405d-9bd4-912b0da914a3.png" /></div><p>When a Rect Mask 2D component is added to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, the visibility of its children will be affected by the shape of its Rect Transform. An <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> component is not required on the parent object for the Rect Mask 2D to function properly.</p><p>In the following image, an Empty UI GameObject is created and a Rect Mask 2D is added to it. It is then given a child UI Image. As you can see, the triangle is masked by the Rect transform area:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/c285df8f-5050-4b21-9b6b-3c1b2920aa97.png" /></div><p>Rect Mask 2D Component Example  in the Chapter7Text Scene</p><p>If you want to apply a mask to a rectangular shape, I highly recommend <span>that</span><a id="id325630294" class="indexterm"></a> you use the Rect Mask 2D component rather than the stand <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Mask</span><a id="id325630304" class="indexterm"></a></code></strong> component, as it is more performant.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note60"></a>Note</h3><p>It's important to note that, as implied by the name Rect Mask 2D, this mask will only work on 2D objects.
