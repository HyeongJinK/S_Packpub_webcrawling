The Event System allows you to easily receive <span>player</span><a id="id325334214" class="indexterm"></a> interaction and send those interactions to objects in your scene through events. Note that I said "objects in your scene" and not "UI objects". The Event System allows you to send events to non-UI items, too!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note25"></a>Note</h3><p><span>Before</span> we proceed, I'd like to note my use of EventSystem (one word) and Event System (two words), because I will be switching back and forth between the two. I want you to know that I am doing it deliberately and am not just randomly deciding that sometimes I hate the spacebar.</p><p>I will use EventSystem (one word) to reference the actual GameObject that appears in the Heirarchy of your scene and Event System (two words) to reference the system that handles events.</p></div><p>The Event System does quite a few things for you other than just sending events to objects. It also keeps track of the currently selected GameObject, the Input Modules, and Raycasting.</p><p>The <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> GameObject initializes, by default, with three components: the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong> Manager, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Standalone Input Module</code></strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/f0bb4e42-0dfb-4cff-a79a-6ff57f9b8ddd.png" /></div><p>Since <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> is a GameObject, it physically exists within the scene (even though it has no renderable component making it visible) and therefore has a <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> component like all other GameObjects. You should be familiar with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transform</code></strong> component by now, so we won't discuss it further. However, the other two components do merit further discussion. Let's look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong> Manager Component more closely now. We'll also discuss the <strong class="userinput"><code>Standalone Input Module</code></strong> Component in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Input Modules</em></span> section of this chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"></a>Note</h3><p>You cannot have more than that one <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> GameObject in your scene. If you try to add a new one in the scene via <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong>, a new one will not be added, and the one currently in the scene will be selected for you.</p><p>If you manage to add a second <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> to your scene (by perhaps using <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl + D</em></span> to duplicate the existing one), you will see a warning message on your <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong>.
If you have more than one <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> GameObject in your scene, only the first one added will actually do anything. Any additional EventSystems will be non-functional.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec30"></a>Event System Manager</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Event System Manager</strong></span> is the component <span>that</span><a id="id325601390" class="indexterm"></a> actually does all the tracking and managing of the various <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong> elements.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to work with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Event System</code></strong> without using UI, the <code class="literal">EventSystem</code> GameObject will not be automatically created for you.
