You can create a <code class="literal">Panel</code> by selecting <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong></span> | <span><strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong></span> | <span><strong class="userinput"><code>Panel</code></strong></span>. Its important to note that <span>there</span><a id="id325599118" class="indexterm"></a> is no Panel component. Panels are really just GameObjects that have <strong class="userinput"><code>Rect Transform</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Canvas Renderer</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> components. So, really, a UI Panel is just a UI Image with a few properties predefined for it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/a1fc94de-e8c9-43a9-8021-3d92c88d07ce.png" /></div><p>By default, <strong class="userinput"><code>Panels</code></strong> start with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Background</code></strong> image (which is just a grey rounded rectangle) as the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> with medium opacity. You can replace the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Image</code></strong> with another image or remove the image entirely.</p><p>Panels are very useful when you are trying to ensure that items scale and are appropriately relative to each other. Items that are contained within the same Panel will scale relative to the Panel and maintain their relative position to each other in the process.</p><p>We will look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> component more thoroughly soon, but, now that we are looking at an object that will allow us to edit its <strong class="userinput"><code>Rect Transform</code></strong> component, let's explore that <span>component.</span></p></div>
