They can be found within the scene labeled <code class="literal">Chapter8Text</code> in the <code class="literal">Assets/Scene/ExamplesInText/Chapter8Text</code> folder.</p></div><p><span>This</span> chapter assumes that you have a basic understanding of Unity's Animation System and will not go into detail describing the names of the various menus and layout of the Animation Window and Animator Window. Animation Clips and Animators will be described briefly, with a focus on how they relate to UI and the implementation that will be discussed in the examples at the end of the chapter.</p><p>Even though I am assuming that you have a basic understanding of Unity's Animation System, I do want to emphasize the difference between an Animation Clip and the Animator.</p><p>When creating animations for items in Unity, you start with <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Clips</strong></span>. An Animation Clip should represent a single distinct action or motion. So, for example, if you had a menu that performed two separate actions, bouncing and zooming, you'd make each of those actions a separate Animation Clip. Although you can have multiple things happen in a single Animation Clip, it is very important not to put multiple actions in a single clip unless they are always going to happen at the same time.</p><p>Every GameObject can have multiple Animation Clips. The <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> determines how all of these Animations link together. So, a Game Object's Animator will have all of its Animation Clips within it.</p><p>I wanted to make this distinction, because, in the past, I have seen projects with epic Animation Clips containing multiple actions, which should have been broken down into more simple motions.</p></div>
