One advantage of the Unity Event System is that it translates very well to mobile devices. An action such as clicking a button with a mouse translates perfectly to a touch or tap gesture. There are a few interactions that don't translate, however, such as keyboard key presses, right-clicking, and scrolling the mouse wheel. Let's discuss a few items of UI design that are specific to mobile/touchscreen devices.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The recommended button sizes for mobile games</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Laying out interactions based on the thumb zone</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to access multi-touch</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When to use the accelerometer and gyroscope</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating on-screen D-pads</li></ul></div></div>
