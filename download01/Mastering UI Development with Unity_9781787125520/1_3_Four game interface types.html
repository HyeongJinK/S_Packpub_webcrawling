However, there are actually four different types of game interfaces: non-diegetic, diegetic, meta, and spatial.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note4"></a>Note</h3><p><span>Fagerholt and Lorentzon</span> first described these four different interface types in the 2009 <span class="emphasis"><em>Beyond the HUD: User Interfaces for Increased Player Immersion in FPS Games: Master of Science Thesis</em></span>. Since then, the terminology has been widely used throughout the field of UI game design.

This information exists purely for the player to view, and the characters within the <span>game</span><a id="id325606656" class="indexterm"></a> are not aware of its presence. It exists on the <span class="emphasis"><em>fourth</em></span> wall of the game view and appears to be on the screen in front of everything. The examples of this type of UI are endless, as nearly every game has some non-diegetic UI elements.</p><p>Alternatively, a <span class="strong"><strong>diegetic</strong></span> interface is one that exists within the <span>game</span><a id="id325606833" class="indexterm"></a> world and the characters within the game are aware of its presence. Common examples of this include characters looking at inventory or maps. The most commonly referred-to example of diegetic UI is the inventory and health display within <span class="emphasis"><em><span>Deadspace</span></em></span>. The inventory displays in a holographic display window that pops up in front of the playable character, and they interact with it as you select their weaponry. His health is also indicated by a meter on his back. The inventory of <span class="emphasis"><em>Alone in the Dark</em></span> (2008) is displayed in a diegetic way as well. While there are some UI elements that only the player can see, the main character views inventory within their jacket pockets and interacts with the items. <span class="emphasis"><em>Uncharted Lost Legacy</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Far Cry 2</em></span> both use maps that the characters physically hold in the scene and interact with. <span class="emphasis"><em>Fallout 3</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Fallout 4</em></span> use a diegetic interface to display the inventory and map on the character's Pip-boy, which is permanently attached to their arm. Games also use this type of display when characters are in a vehicle or suit, where various displays appear on the shield, window, or cockpit.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Meta</strong></span> interfaces are interfaces that the characters in the <span>game</span><a id="id325611041" class="indexterm"></a> are aware of, but they are not physically displayed within the scene. Common examples of this are speed displays for racing games. <span class="emphasis"><em>Forza 7</em></span> actually uses a combination of meta and diegetic displays for the speedometer. A meta speed indicator is persistently on the lower-right corner of the screen for the player to see. Since the character is constantly aware of how fast they are driving, they would be aware of this speed indicator, therefore making it a meta interface. There is also a diegetic speedometer in the car's dash that is displayed when playing in first-person view. Another common usage of this type of display is a cell phone that appears on the screen <span>but is implied the playable character is interacting with in</span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Persona 5</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Catherine</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em></span> all use this interface type for cell phone interactions.</p><p>The last type of interface, <span class="strong"><strong>spatial</strong></span>, exists in the scene, but the characters within the game are not aware of it. Interfaces that exist in the scene but <span>that</span><a id="id325620693" class="indexterm"></a> the characters are not aware of are incredibly common. This is commonly used to let the player know where in the scene interactable items are, what the in-game character is doing, or information about characters and items in the scene. For example, in <span class="emphasis"><em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></span>, arrows appear over the heads of enemies, indicating who Link will attack. Link is not actually aware of these arrows; they are there for the player to know who he is focusing on. <span class="emphasis"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em></span> uses a spatial interface to indicate where the player can dig; a shovel icon appears over the diggable areas.</p></div>
