We discussed them briefly in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Canvases, Panels, and Basic Layouts</em></span> because it was pretty hard to start laying out UI without having anything to display visually. UI Text and UI Images are also subcomponents of the UI elements we covered in the previous chapters, so we've worked with them at their basic level. Now we will discuss these two UI objects more thoroughly so that we can have more control over our UI Text and UI Images. We will also discuss TextMesh Pro-Text objects and how they allow for even more control of the text in our <span>game</span>.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating UI Text objects and setting their properties</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing fonts into Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using markup format with UI Text objects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating UI Images and setting their properties</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using the various UI Effects components to further customize our graphical UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating TextMesh Pro-Text Objects and setting their properties</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating text that animates, as if, being typed out</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a custom font to be used with UI Text objects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating text that wraps along a curve and renders with a gradient</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating horizontal and circular progress bars</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"></a>Note</h3><p>All the examples shown in this section can be found within the Unity project provided in the code bundle.
