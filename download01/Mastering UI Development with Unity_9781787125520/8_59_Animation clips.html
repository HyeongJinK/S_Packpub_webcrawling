<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec60"></a>Animation clips</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The great thing about the Unity Animation System is that you can animate nearly any property of the UI. To create an Animation Clip, simply <span>open</span><a id="id325368569" class="indexterm"></a> the Animation Window (<strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Animation</code></strong> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span>), and with the UI element you want to animate, select <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Create</span></code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/d81b5015-b932-4c11-9727-5c5012e19fee.png" /></div><p>Once you do so, you'll be prompted to save the Animation Clip.</p><p>After creating the Animation Clip, you can then add any property to the clip's timeline by clicking on <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Property</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/da583dc3-5814-440f-886a-4b4577f7dd76.png" /></div><p>Doing so will bring up every component of the object, as well as a list of all of its children:</p><p><strong class="userinput"><code><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/7fab5029-b180-4b5e-946f-0974c9f7aa0a.png" /></div></code></strong></p><p>You can also view the components and children of each child:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/f780fd32-f11c-4a69-b3fb-3649ee5f315c.png" /></div><p>Then, you can view the components and <span>children</span><a id="id325611038" class="indexterm"></a> of those children. You can continue on in this manner until you have exhausted the list of GameObjects that are nested under the selected GameObject.</p><p>If you expand a component of GameObject or one of its children, you will then note a list of all properties of that component that can be animated. As you will notice in the following screenshot, almost every property on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Slider</code></strong> component can be animated in this way:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/94204e1b-9b6c-43cf-8531-9e95676adf1f.png" /></div><p>Only properties that have the following data types can be animated with the Animation System:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Vector2, Vector3, and Vector4</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Quaternion</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">bool</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">float</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Color</li></ul></div><p>Selecting the plus sign will add the property to the <span>Animation</span><a id="id325620694" class="indexterm"></a> timeline along with two keyframes. You can then change the values of each property at the various keyframes.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note85"></a>Note</h3><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>keyframe</strong></span> is <span>an important or</span> "key" (hence the name) frame within an animation. It represents the start or end point of a transition within an animation.</p></div><p>In the preceding screenshot, the values encased in the <span>red boxes</span> represent the value of the property at the particular frame. Boolean values are represented by checkboxes, and float values are represented by numbers. Each type can be edited directly by selecting them.</p><p>Unity will fill in the values between the keyframes so that they change (or interpolate) on a curve. You can view the interpolation curve by selecting the <strong class="userinput"><code>Curve Tab</code></strong>.</p><p>You can watch the changes occur throughout all frames by playing the animation or scrubbing the playhead.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note86"></a>Note</h3><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>playhead</strong></span> is the marker that indicates what frame is currently being displayed. "<span class="strong"><strong>Scrubbing</strong></span> the playhead" means to drag the playhead across the timeline to view changes over individual frames.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/7aa13724-b8d8-4e98-8098-c733de9cf48a.png" /></div><p>Boolean properties are interpolated on a linear curve. All other properties (since they are combination of floats) are interpolated along an ease-in-out curve. You can adjust these by adjusting the handles of the tangents at the keyframes by right-clicking on the keyframe.</p><p>Often times, these ease-in-out curves <span>will</span><a id="id325630306" class="indexterm"></a> cause your UI to appear <span class="emphasis"><em>bouncy</em></span>, and adjusting the interpolation curve can remove that bounce. For example, animating an object between two points may make the object go past the destination point momentarily due to the ease-in-out nature of the default interpolation curve.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec85"></a>Animation Events</h3></div></div></div><p>One of my favorite things about <span>Animation</span><a id="id325630322" class="indexterm"></a> Clips is the ability to add Animation Events to frames on the timeline. Animation Events allow you to call functions that exist on the GameObject at specified frames. They are represented by white <span class="emphasis"><em>flags</em></span> above the timeline, and hovering over them will show the name of the function called by the Animation Event.</p><p>An Animation Event can only call a function that exists somewhere on the GameObject the Animation Clip is attached to. The function can be public or private and can also have a parameter. The parameter can be of the following types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">float</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">int</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">string</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">An object reference</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">An <code class="literal">AnimationEvent</code> object</li></ul></div><p>You can add an Animation Event to the Animation Clip's timeline by right-clicking on the area above the frame in which you wish to place the Animation Event and clicking on either the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Animation Event</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Event</code></strong> button. Selecting the Add Event button will add the Animation Event wherever the playhead currently rests.</p><p>You can delete the Animation Event by selecting the white flag and clicking on <strong class="userinput"><code>Delete</code></strong>, and you can move it by clicking on it and dragging it.</p><p>The appearance of the Animation Event's Inspector depends on whether the Animation Clip is attached to a GameObject and whether the GameObject is currently selected. The two appearances are shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/8d372fb4-0c60-4f57-ac8f-c120de1aa203.png" /></div><p>If the Animation Clip is attached to a GameObject <span>and</span><a id="id325368546" class="indexterm"></a> the GameObject is selected, a drop-down menu will appear with a list of all available functions. If the selected function has a parameter, then options concerning the parameter will be made available (take a look at the preceding screenshot). Otherwise, the name of the function and the parameters to pass will have to be entered manually.</p></div></div>
