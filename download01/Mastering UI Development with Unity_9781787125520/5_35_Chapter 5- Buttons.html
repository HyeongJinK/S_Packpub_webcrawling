<div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05"></a>Chapter 5. Buttons</h2></div></div></div><p><span>Buttons</span> provided by Unity's UI system are graphical objects that preutilize the Event System we covered in the last chapter. When a Button is placed in a scene, it automatically has components added to it that allow the player to interact with it. This makes sense, because the whole point of a button is to interact with it.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating UI Buttons and setting their properties</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to set button transitions that make the button change appearance when it is highlighted, pressed, or disabled</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Navigating button selection on screen with the keyboard or joystick</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to create an onscreen button that looks like it is physically being pressed</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to create buttons that swap images without using the built-in transitions, like a mute/unmute button</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Loading scenes with a button press</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating Button Transition <span>Animations</span></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip38"></a>Note</h3><p>All the examples shown in this section can be found within the Unity project provided in the code bundle. They can be found within the scene labeled <code class="literal">Chapter5Text</code> in the <code class="literal">Assets/Scene/ExamplesInText/</code> folder.
Each example image has a caption stating the example number within the scene.
In the scene, each example is on its own Canvas and some of the Canvases are deactivated. To view an example on a deactivated Canvas, simply select the checkbox next to the Canvas' name in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/a2b87674-56df-4b59-8d93-839dbecb7b36.png" /></div></div></div>
