There are a few <span>things</span><a id="id325334202" class="indexterm"></a> you have to keep in mind, though.</p><p>When working with 3D scenes, you may want your UI to always face the player, regardless of how the player turns the camera—this is known as a <span class="strong"><strong>billboard effect</strong></span>. You can achieve this with a simple <code class="literal">LookAt()</code> function on the transform of the object in the <code class="literal">Update()</code> function: </p><pre class="programlisting">transform.LookAt(2*transform.position-theCamera.transform.position );</pre><p>You can use a variation of the preceding code, depending on how you want the rotation to behave.</p><p>Another consideration with 3D World Space UI is the distance it is away from the camera. You may want to have UI only render when it is a <span>specific</span><a id="id325369947" class="indexterm"></a> distance from the camera, as it may be difficult to see when it is too far away.</p><p>Depending on your project, using World Space Canvases may cause difficulties with Raycasting, making interacting with UI a problem. Tyrus Peace of Floating Island Games recommends creating your own physics layer if you end up having to create your own Raycasting system, as he did with <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloudbase Prime</em></span>, shown earlier in the chapter.</p></div>
