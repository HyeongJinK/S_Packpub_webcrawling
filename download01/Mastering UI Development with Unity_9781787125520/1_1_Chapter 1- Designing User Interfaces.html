This chapter will cover the foundation of designing UI as well as a few key concepts to start you off in the right direction.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Defining UI and GUI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Describing the four types of interfaces</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing a UI layout and color scheme</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Defining interface metaphors</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Discerning and setting resolution and aspect ratio</li></ul></div><p>This book is not about the art of designing UI. It is a technical text that discusses implementation of UI functionality. However, I do want to discuss some basic design principles of UI design. I don't expect you to be an amazing UI artist after reading this chapter. I do hope that you get some basic understanding of layout and design principles from this chapter, though, so that maybe your artist friends won't make too much fun of you.</p></div>
