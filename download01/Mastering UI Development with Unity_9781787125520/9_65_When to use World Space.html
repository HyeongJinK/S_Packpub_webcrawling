The most common reasons for using this rendering mode are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">To have better control of individual UI objects' positions in relation to objects in the scene</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">To rotate or curve the UI elements</li></ul></div><p>For example, the game <span class="emphasis"><em>Mojikara: Japanese Trainer</em></span> uses World Space Canvases to have rotated panels and keep UI objects, such as Text, attached to 3D objects. As you can see from the following screenshot, the panel on the left is rotated just slightly in 3D space, because it is on a World Space Canvas:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/927711a4-4265-435a-8337-214afc35a565.png" /></div><p><span>Image</span> provided by Lisa Walkosz-Migiacio, Intropy Games</p><p>Another example of rotated UI can be found in the game <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloudbase Prime</em></span>, as shown in the following screenshot. It also used World <span>Space</span><a id="id325620679" class="indexterm"></a> rendering to provide create indicators that hover over objects and <span>characters</span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/3874d0a0-b0c4-4a80-8ebe-c43d01536269.png" /></div><p>Image provided by Tyrus Peace, Floating Island Games
</p><p>All the UI in <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloudbase Prime</em></span> was done on World <span>Space</span><a id="id325620795" class="indexterm"></a> Canvases. This allowed the developer to create cool curving UI, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/06228f52-261c-433e-ba1a-88418edbf905.png" /></div><p>Image provided by Tyrus Peace, Floating Island Games
</p><p>Here, you can see how the UI looks in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Editor</code></strong> versus how it looks to the player. This gives a nice peek at how the UI was built:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/0d293023-c263-4f4f-a275-4139846e9cb6.png" /></div><p>Images provided by Tyrus Peace, Floating Island Games</p><p>I recommend checking out the following <span>site</span><a id="id325630296" class="indexterm"></a> to see more ways in which <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloudbase Prime</em></span> implemented World Space UI, as they are truly beautiful: <a class="ulink" href="https://imgur.com/a/hxNgL" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/hxNgL</a>.</p><p>Another common usage of World Space UI is simulating computer screens and monitors within a scene. For example, I built out the following UI for a friend's VR game named <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloud Rise</em></span>. The monitor was simulated by placing a World Space Canvas right on top of the in-game screen. I was then able to easily anchor and animate the UI; in the same way, I rendered the UI in Screen <span>Space.</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/2875de00-5f8d-426f-9e24-95fd3f2d6a38.png" /></div><p>Image provided by Meredith Wilson, Bedhouse Games</p><p>In general, the interactive UIs of VR <span>games</span><a id="id325369729" class="indexterm"></a> are on World Space Canvases, since the player cannot interact with <span class="emphasis"><em>the screen</em></span>. Common usages of VR UI are flat floating panels or wrapping panels.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note94"></a>Note</h3><p>Currently, if you subscribe to Unity Plus or Pro, you can choose to receive a free VR Essentials Pack, which provides functionality for Curved UI. You can find more information about Unity's VR Essential Pack atÂ <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/vr/worldspace-ui-curved-ui" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/vr/worldspace-ui-curved-ui</a>.
If you want to create Curved World Space UI but don't want to pay for a Unity subscription, you can create your own code to do so, or you can use one of the many resources available on the Asset Store.</p></div><p>Hovering indicators are by far the most common use of World Space UI; they are specifically used for health bars over the heads of in-game characters, as shown in the following screenshot of <span class="emphasis"><em>Iris Burning</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/e0a580dc-bef2-424f-9fa6-d8ef76e80118.png" /></div><p>Image provided by William Preston, DCM Studios</p><p>Most people think of 3D games when they think of World Space UI because they think of UI that appears <span class="emphasis"><em>far away</em></span>, but it's commonly used in 2D <span>games</span><a id="id325369773" class="indexterm"></a> as well! Management and RTS games use UI quite frequently to create buttons and progress bars, and other UI elements maintain their position with the object they interact with. The World Space UI can be on one Canvas that encompasses all items on the screen, with individual UI items matching the 2D World Space coordinates of the items they represent, or they can be on individual Canvases of their respective items. We will cover how to create a 2D game using World Space UI in an example at the end of the chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note95"></a>Note</h3><p>I am lucky enough to have a lot of friends who work in game development and who were willing to provide screenshots of World Space Canvases for this section.
