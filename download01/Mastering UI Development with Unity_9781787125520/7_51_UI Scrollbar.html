<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec53"></a>UI Scrollbar</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The UI Scrollbar object allows the <span>user</span><a id="id325334202" class="indexterm"></a> to drag a handle along a path. The position of the handle on the path affects the position of an image or objects within a usable area.</p><p>If you're having trouble seeing what a scroll bar is from the preceding description, it is most commonly used in video games with menus that have a lot of information within a viewable area that is smaller than the area that all the information takes up.</p><p>To create a UI Scrollbar, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>UI</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Scrollbar</code></strong>. By default, a UI Scrollbar has a child named <code class="literal">Sliding Area</code>. The <code class="literal">Sliding Area</code> also has a child named <code class="literal">Handle</code>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Sliding Area</code> child is an empty GameObject. Its purpose is to ensure that its child, the <code class="literal">Handle</code>, is correctly positioned and aligned. The <code class="literal">Handle</code> is a UI Image. The <code class="literal">Handle</code> represents the interactable area of the <code class="literal">Scrollbar</code>.</p><p>Unlike the Toggle and Slider GameObjects, the background image of the Scrollbar is actually on the main <code class="literal">Scrollbar</code> parent object and not on a <span>child</span><a id="id325599106" class="indexterm"></a> named <code class="literal">Background</code>. Therefore, if you want to change the appearance of the Scrollbar's background and Handle, you change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Source Images</code></strong> of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong> components on the <code class="literal">Scrollbar</code> parent and <code class="literal">Handle</code> child, respectively.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec77"></a>The Scrollbar component</h3></div></div></div><p>The parent <code class="literal">Scrollbar</code> object has a <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Scrollbar</span><a id="id325599141" class="indexterm"></a></code></strong> component. It has all the properties common to the interactable UI objects, along with a few that are exclusive to Scrollbars:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781787125520/graphics/129a9350-ef87-46aa-952d-3615ee70705d.png" /></div><p>The Scrollbar works (and looks) just like the Slider. However, you'll note that you do not have the ability to select the range of values for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scrollbar</code></strong> as you do with a <strong class="userinput"><code>Slider</code></strong>. A Scrollbar's values are always restricted to be between <code class="literal">0</code> and <code class="literal">1</code>. This difference in properties has to do with a difference in intent for the two types of objects. Sliders are used, generally, to allow the player to select values that can vary greatly based on the slider. However, Scrollbars are used to move objects that take up more room than the viewable space. Due to this, the Scrollbar's position should easily translate to a percentage, or value between <code class="literal">0</code> and <code class="literal">1</code>.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Handle Rect</code></strong> property assigns the Rect Transform of the object that displays the handle's image. By default, the Rect Transform of <code class="literal">Handle</code> is assigned to this property. You'll note that the Rect Transform component on the <code class="literal">Handle</code> GameObject has the <strong class="userinput"><code>Some values driven by Scrollbar</code></strong> message, since the position of <code class="literal">Handle</code> is affected by the Scrollbar.</p><p>As with Sliders, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Value</code></strong> property is the value of the <code class="literal">Scrollbar</code>. The position of the Scrollbar's <code class="literal">Handle</code> is tied to this property. The slider in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> next to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Value</code></strong> property mirrors the position of the Scrollbar's <code class="literal">Handle</code>.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Direction</code></strong> property allows you to select the orientation of the Scrollbar. The available options are the same as with a Slider and translate accordingly: <strong class="userinput"><code>Left To Right</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Right To Left</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Bottom To Top</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Top to Bottom</code></strong>.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Size</code></strong> property determines the percentage of the Scrollbar's <code class="literal">Sliding Area</code> taken up by the Scrollbar's <code class="literal">Handle</code>. This can be any float value from <code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">1</code>. I recommend that you choose a value relative to the size of the object(s) being scrolled so that the Scrollbar's movement feels more intuitive. This means that the larger the scrollable area is, the smaller the Scrollbar <code class="literal">Handle</code> becomes.</p><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Number of Steps</code></strong> property is used if you want the Scrollbar to have staggered, discrete steps and don't want it to have continuously controlled movement. This is used if you want your scrollbar to move the scrolling object(s) to specific locations.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip63"></a>Note</h3><p>Often you will see a scroll area represented by dots (like the dots that identify which home screen you are viewing on an iOS device). This can be achieved using a <strong class="userinput"><code>Number of Steps</code></strong> greater than <code class="literal">0</code>. Setting this value to <code class="literal">0</code> will allow for continuously controlled movement rather than staggered discrete steps.</p></div><p>Examples of creating continuous and <span>discrete</span><a id="id325631322" class="indexterm"></a> Scrollbars are provided in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples</em></span> section at the end of this chapter.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec53"></a>Scrollbar default event – On Value Changed (Single)</h4></div></div></div><p>The Scrollbar component's default <span>event</span><a id="id325631340" class="indexterm"></a> is the <strong class="userinput"><code>On Value Changed</code></strong> Event, as seen in the <strong class="userinput"><code>On Value Changed (Single)</code></strong> section of the Scrollbar component. This event will trigger whenever the Scrollbar's Handle is moved. It can accept a float argument. It works identically to that of the Slider.</p></div></div></div>
