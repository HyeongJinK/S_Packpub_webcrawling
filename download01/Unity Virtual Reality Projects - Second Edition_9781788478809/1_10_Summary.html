There's no single definition, and it's a moving target. We are not alone, as everyone's still trying to figure it out. The fact is that virtual reality is a new medium that will take years, if not decades, to reach its potential.</p><p>VR is not just for games; it can be a game changer for many different applications. We identified over a dozen. There are different kinds of VR experiences, which we'll explore in the projects in this book.</p><p>VR headsets can be divided into those that require a separate processing unit (such as a desktop PC or a console) that runs with a powerful GPU and the ones that use your mobile technologies for processing.</p><p>We're all pioneers living at an exciting time. Because you're reading this book, you're one, too. Whatever happens next is literally up to you. <span><span class="emphasis"><em>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.</em></span></span></p><p>So, let's get to it!</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll jump right into Unity and create our first 3D scene and learn about world coordinates, scaling, and importing 3D assets. Then, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03"><span>Chapter 3</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em><span>VR Build and Run</span></em></span>, we'll build and run it on a VR headset, and we'll discuss how virtual reality really works.</p></div>
