Let's see how that is done. <span class="emphasis"><em>This scenario will assume you have a two hand controller VR system.</em></span> We'll describe it using the SteamVR camera rig, involving attaching the controls to your left hand and selecting them with your right.</p><p>Converting our dashboard control panel into a wrist palette is not too difficult. We just need to scale it appropriately and attach it to the hand controller.</p><p>Given you've built the scene up to the point described in the previous <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Unity UI and SteamVR </em></span>section, including the SteamVR <code class="literal">Player</code> rig (instead of <code class="literal">[CameraRig]</code>), we'll duplicate and repurpose the <code class="literal">Dashboard</code> to use it on your left wrist:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>In Hierarchy, right-click the Dashboard and Duplicate.</li><li>Rename the new one to "Palette".</li><li>Disable the old Dashboard.</li><li>Drag the Palette as a child of the Player/Hand1 object.</li></ol></div><p>Now we'll modify the Palette graphics as follows. Feel free to <span>change for what works for you</span>:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span>On the Palette itself, set its Pos X,Y,Z to (0, 0.1, -0.1); Rotation to (90, -150, -115); Scale (X,Y,Z) to 0.0005; </span></li><li>Unfold the Palette and disable or delete the Raw Image object.</li><li>Enable the Image child object (if it's missing, create a new Image with Anchor Presets to stretch-stretch).</li><li>Set the Image Scale (X,Y,Z) to 0.5.</li><li>Set the Image Color Alpha to 75 so it's translucent. </li><li>Enable the Text child object. Set its Rect Transform Top to 100, Font Size to 18, and Text to "Hose".</li><li>Move the StartButton Pos Y to 0.</li><li>Move the StopButton Pos Y to 0.</li></ol></div><p>That's it! All of the click wiring we set up for the Dashboard works without change. Shown here is a screenshot of using the Palette attached to the left-hand controller, and selecting the start button on it with the right-hand controller:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/621d67b0-51c2-4a8b-add5-a037770e5e54.png" /></div><p>Naturally, the palette can be extended with other buttons and input controls. If you had multiple panels arranged as the sides of cube (like the TiltBrush menu), you could use the thumb pad to scroll or rotate between the various menus.  And that's how it's done.</p></div>
