Researchers, psychologists, and technologists <span>with</span><a id="id325317294" class="indexterm"></a> a wide array of specializations and PhDs are studying the problem to better understand the underlying causes and find solutions.</p><p>A cause of VR motion sickness is a lag in screen updates, or latency, when you're moving your head. Your brain expects the world around you to change exactly in sync. Any perceptible delay can make you feel uncomfortable, to say the least.</p><p>Latency can be reduced by faster rendering of each frame, keeping to the recommended frames per second. Device manufacturers see this as their problem to solve, in both hardware and device driver software. GPU and chip manufacturers see it as a processor performance and throughput problem. We will undoubtedly see leaps and bounds of improvements over the coming years.</p><p>At the same time, as VR developers, we need to be aware of latency and other causes of VR motion sickness. Developers need to look at it like it's our problem too because ultimately, it comes down to performance and ergonomics. With an ongoing dichotomy of mobile VR versus desktop VR, there will always be upper bounds on the performance of devices that our players will be using. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch13">Chapter 13</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Optimizing for Performance and Comfort</em></span>, we dive into the technical details of the rendering pipeline and performance.</p><p>But it's not just technology. I can get nauseous riding a real-world roller coaster. So, why wouldn't a VR one have a similar effect? Things to consider that help improve your players' comfort and safety include game mechanics and user experience design such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Don't move fast</strong></span>: When moving or animating a first-person character, don't move too fast. High-speed first-person shooter games that work on gaming consoles and desktop PCs may not work out so well in VR.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Look forward</strong></span>: When moving through a scene, if you're looking to the side rather than straight ahead, you're more likely to feel nauseous.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Don't turn your head too fast</strong></span>: Discourage users from turning their head quickly with the VR headset on. The latency in updating the HMD screen is aggravated by larger changes in the viewport in small time slices.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Offer comfort mode</strong></span>: When a scene requires you to quickly turn yourself a lot of times, provide a ratcheted rotation mechanism, also known as comfort mode, which lets you change the direction in which you look in larger increments.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Use fade or blink</strong></span> cuts during teleportation and scene changes. When fading, go to a dark color, as white can be startling.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Use tunneling</strong></span>Â or other techniques during locomotion. Reduce what is visible in the peripheral vision by masking the camera except what is just in front of you.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Use a third-person camera</strong></span>: If you have high-speed action but you don't necessarily intend to give the user a thrill ride, use a third-person camera view.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Stay grounded</strong></span>: Provide visual cues that help the user stay grounded, such as horizon lines, nearby objects in your field of view, and relative fixed-position objects, such as dashboards and body parts.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Provide an option to recenter the view</strong></span>: Mobile VR devices, in particular, are subject to drift and the need to be recentered on occasion. With wired VR devices, it helps you avoid getting tangled in HMD wires. As a safety issue, recentering your view relative to the real world may help you avoid hitting furniture and walls in the physical space.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Don't use cut scenes</strong></span>: In traditional games (and movies), a technique that can be used to transition between levels is to show a 2D cutscene movie. This does not work in VR if the head motion detection is disabled. It breaks the immersion and can cause nausea. An alternative is to simply fade to black and then open the new scene.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Optimize rendering performance</strong></span>: It behooves all VR developers to understand the underlying causes of latency-specifically rendering performance-and what you can do to optimize it, such as lowering the poly count and choosing lighting models carefully. Learn to use performance monitoring tools in order to keep the frames per second within the expected <span>and</span><a id="id325560756" class="indexterm"></a> acceptable limits. More on this will be discussed in <span><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch10">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using All 360 Degrees</em></span>.</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Encourage users to take breaks</strong></span>: Alternatively, you can maybe just provide a puke-bag with your game! Or not.</li></ul></div></div>
