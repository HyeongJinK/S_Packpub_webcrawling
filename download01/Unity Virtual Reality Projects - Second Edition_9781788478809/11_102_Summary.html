We began by deciding what we want to do, planning out the timeline, music track, graphic assets, animation sequences, and lighting. We imported our assets and placed them in the scene, then created a Timeline and roughed out when specific objects are enabled and disabled using an Activation Track. Next, we animated several objects, including growing the tree, floating the nest, and rumbling the egg. We also animated the lighting, learning how to animate game object parameters other than Transforms.</p><p>We also used Animation Clips and an Animator Controller, using animations imported from a third-party package. We reviewed a script that calls into the Animator and wrote a controller on top of that, to fly the bird from location to location. Lastly, we added interactions to the story, using gaze-based control to start and replay the experience.</p><p>In the next chapter, we go social as we look at ways to add multi-user networking to Unity VR projects and how to add scenes to the emerging metaverse. Multiplayer games are familiar to most of us, but when combined with virtual reality, it provides a social experience that is unparalleled by any other technology. We will learn about networking technology using the Unity Networking features.</p></div>
