Developers typically use tools outside of Unity and then import their models. We introduced you to the free and open source Blender modeling app as well as Google Tilt Brush and showed you how to export assets and then import them into Unity, including cloud services like Google Poly.</p><p>One of the really cool things about developing for VR is how quickly things are changing. It's the burgeoning of a new industry, a new media, and new paradigms evolve year to year as VR comes into its own. New devices are being introduced every quarter. Unity is updated every month. New software tools are released every week. There are new things to do and learn every day. Of course, this can also be very frustrating. My advice is to not let this get to you, and rather embrace it.</p><p>One key to this is to continuously try new things. Thatâ€™s what we tried to usher you through in this chapter. Come up with an idea, then see if you can get it to work. Try out new software. Learn a new Unity feature. Do things one at a time so you don't become overwhelmed. Of course, that's what this book is about. The journey is a continuous and adventurous one.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll set up your development system and Unity settings to build and run the project to play in your VR headset.</p></div>
