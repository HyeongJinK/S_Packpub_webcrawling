Not only can these objects can be balls and toys, or tools and weapons, but they can be buttons you interact with and other user interface widgets. Furthermore, Unity includes a user interface canvas system for building menus and other UI.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Graphical user interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>) or just UI, usually <span>refers</span><a id="id325547518" class="indexterm"></a> to on-screen two-dimensional graphics, which overlay the main gameplay and present information to the user with status messages, gauges, and input controls such as menus, buttons, sliders, and so on.</p><p>In Unity, UI elements always <span>reside</span><a id="id325549815" class="indexterm"></a> on a <span class="strong"><strong>canvas</strong></span>. The Unity manual describes the <code class="literal">canvas</code> component as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The <code class="literal">canvas</code> component represents the abstract space in which the UI is laid out and rendered. All UI elements must be children of a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> that has a <code class="literal">canvas</code> component attached.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In conventional video games, UI objects are usually <span>rendered</span><a id="id325576980" class="indexterm"></a> in a <span class="strong"><strong>screen space</strong></span> canvas as an overlay. The screen space UI is analogous to a piece of cardboard pasted on your TV or monitor, overlaying the game action behind it.</p><p>However, that doesn't work in VR. If you attempt to use screen space for UI in virtual reality, you'll run into issues. Since there are two stereographic cameras, you need separate views for each eye. While conventional games may co-opt the edges of the screen for UI, <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual reality has no screen edges</em></span>!</p><p>Instead, in VR, we use various approaches that place the user interface <span>elements</span><a id="id325577029" class="indexterm"></a> in <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> rather than screen space. In this chapter, I characterize a number of these types. We'll define these types in detail and show you examples of them throughout this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Visor heads-up display</strong></span>: In a visor <span class="strong"><strong>heads-up display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>), the user <span>interface</span><a id="id325581597" class="indexterm"></a> canvas appears at the same spot in front of <span>your</span><a id="id325581604" class="indexterm"></a> eyes regardless of your head movement
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reticle cursors</strong></span>: Similar <span>to</span><a id="id325581616" class="indexterm"></a> visor HUD, a crosshair or a pointer cursor is used to choose things in the scene</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Windshield HUD</strong></span>: This is a pop-up <span>panel</span><a id="id325581627" class="indexterm"></a> floating in 3D space like a windshield in a cockpit</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Game element UI</strong></span>: The canvas is <span>in</span><a id="id325581669" class="indexterm"></a> the scene as a part of the gameplay, like a scoreboard in a stadium</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Info bubble</strong></span>: This is a UI message <span>that</span><a id="id325581681" class="indexterm"></a> is attached to objects in the scene, like a thought bubble hovering over a character's head</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>In-game dashboard</strong></span>: This is a control panel <span>that</span><a id="id325581692" class="indexterm"></a> is a part of the gameplay, usually at waist or desk height</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Wrist-based menu palette</strong></span>: With two-handed <span>input</span><a id="id325581706" class="indexterm"></a> controllers, one hand can hold a menu palette while the other makes selections and uses the selected tool</li></ul></div><p>The differences in these UI techniques basically comes down to where and when you display the canvas and how the user interacts with it. In this chapter, we're going to try each of these in turn. Along the way, we'll also continue to explore user input with head movement and gestures as well as button clicks.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip57"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that some of the exercises in this chapter use the scene completed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04"><span>Chapter 4</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gaze-Based Control</em></span>, but are separate and not directly required by the other chapters in this book. If you decide to skip any of it or not save your work, that's OK.</p></div></div>
