The full-featured <span class="strong"><strong>Personal Edition</strong></span> is free and runs on both Windows and Mac. To get Unity, go to <a class="ulink" href="https://store.unity.com/" target="_blank">https://store.unity.com/</a>, select the version that <span>you</span><a id="id325549821" class="indexterm"></a> want, click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Download Installer</code></strong>, and continue following the instructions. This book assumes you have version 2017.2 or later of Unity.</p><p>For you beginners out there, we're going to take this first section nice and slow, with more hand-holding than what you'll get later on in the book. Furthermore, even if you already know Unity and have developed your own games, it may be worthwhile to revisit the fundamental concepts, since the rules are sometimes different when designing for virtual reality.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec9"></a>Creating a new Unity project</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's <span>create</span><a id="id325581699" class="indexterm"></a> a new Unity project named <code class="literal">VR_is_Awesome</code>, or whatever you'd like.</p><p>To create a new Unity project, launch Unity from your operating system and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Open</code></strong> dialog box will appear. From this dialog box, select <strong class="userinput"><code>New</code></strong>, which opens a <strong class="userinput"><code>New Project</code></strong> dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/0377758d-6d61-4dfd-a0ec-74e497fb54e3.png" /></div><p>Fill in the name of your project and verify that the folder location is what you want.

Here's a brief explanation of each panel that is shown in the preceding layout image (your layout may be different):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel on the upper left-hand side (highlighted) is where you can visually compose the 3D space of the current scene, including the placement of objects.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Below the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> view (lower left-hand side), which shows the actual game camera view (presently, it is empty with an ambient sky). When in <span class="strong"><strong>Play Mode</strong></span>, your game runs in this panel.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">In the center, we have arranged the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panels (from the top to the bottom, respectively).</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel provides a tree view of all the <span class="emphasis"><em>objects</em></span> in the current scene.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel contains all the <span class="emphasis"><em>reusable assets</em></span> for the project, including the ones imported as well as those that you'll create along the way.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong class="userinput"><code>Console</code></strong> panel shows messages from Unity, including <span class="emphasis"><em>warnings and errors</em></span> from code scripts.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">On the right-hand side is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel (highlighted), which contains the properties of the currently selected object. (Objects are selected by clicking on them in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong>, or the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel). The <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel has separate panes for each component of the object.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">At the top is the main menu bar (on a Mac, this will be at the top of your screen, not at the top of the Unity window). There's a toolbar area with various controls that we'll use later on, including the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> (triangle icon) button that starts <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> mode.</li></ul></div><p>From the main menu bar's <strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong> menu, you can open additional panels as needed. The editor's user interface is configurable. Each panel can be rearranged, resized, and tabbed by grabbing one of the panel tabs and dragging it. Go ahead, try it! On the upper right-hand side is a <strong class="userinput"><code>Layout</code></strong> selector that lets you either choose between various default layouts or save your own preferences.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"></a>The default world space</h3></div></div></div><p>A default empty Unity scene <span>consists</span><a id="id325577529" class="indexterm"></a> of a <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong> object and a single <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong> object, as listed in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel and depicted in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel also <span>shows a perspective</span> of an infinite reference ground plane grid, like a piece of graph paper with nothing on it yet. The grid spans across the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (red) and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> (blue) axes. The <span class="emphasis"><em>y </em></span>axis (green) is up.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip7"></a>Note</h3><p>An easy way to remember the Gizmo axes colors is by keeping in mind that R-G-B corresponds to <span class="emphasis"><em>X-Y-Z</em></span>.</p></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel shows the details of the currently selected item. Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Directional Light</code></strong> with your mouse, either from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> list or within the scene itself, and look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> panel for each of the properties and components associated with the object, including its transform. An object's transform specifies its position, rotation, and scale in the 3D world space. For example, position (0, 3, 0) is 3 units above (in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> direction) the center of the ground plane (<span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> = <code class="literal">0</code>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> = <code class="literal">0</code>). A rotation of (<code class="literal">50</code>, <code class="literal">330</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>) means that it's rotated 50 degrees around the <span class="emphasis"><em>x </em></span>axis and 330 degrees around the <span class="emphasis"><em>y </em></span>axis. As you'll see, you can change an object's transforms numerically here or directly with the mouse in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel.</p><p>Similarly, if you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong>, it may be located at the (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>, <code class="literal">-10</code>) position with no rotation. That is, it's pointed straight ahead, towards the positive <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> direction.</p><p>When you select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong>, as shown in the preceding editor screenshot, a <strong class="userinput"><code>Camera Preview</code></strong> inset is added to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> panel, which shows the view that the camera presently sees. (If the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game</code></strong> tab is open, you'll see the same view there too). Presently, the view is empty and the reference grid does not get rendered, but a foggy horizon is discernible, with the grey ground plane below and the blue default ambient <strong class="userinput"><code>Skybox</code></strong> above.</p></div></div>
