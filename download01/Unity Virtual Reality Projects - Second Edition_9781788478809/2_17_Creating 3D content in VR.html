After all, it's pretty awkward trying to use an inherently 2D desktop screen with a 2D mouse to form, sculpt, assemble, and manipulate 3D models. If only it could be more like real-life sculpture <span>and</span><a id="id325552440" class="indexterm"></a> construction. So, why not just do it directly in 3D? In VR!</p><p>Like other digital platforms, we can categorize VR apps into ones that present an experience, ones where you interact to engage with the environment, and ones where you actually create content, for yourself or for sharing. An example of the latter and one of the first to be widely successful is Google Tilt Brush (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/" target="_blank">https://www.tiltbrush.com/</a>) where you paint in 3D. This is one my favorite go-to apps when introducing VR to family <span>and</span><a id="id325555076" class="indexterm"></a> friends. Tilt Brush lets you paint in 3D in virtual reality.</p><p>Other VR 3D with sculpting and painting tools, to name just a few, include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Google Blocks</strong></span>: Low <span>poly</span><a id="id325555197" class="indexterm"></a> modeling (<a class="ulink" href="https://vr.google.com/blocks/" target="_blank">https://vr.google.com/blocks/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Medium</strong></span>: Sculpt, model, paint <span>in</span><a id="id325560759" class="indexterm"></a> VR (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.oculus.com/medium/" target="_blank">https://www.oculus.com/medium/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Quill</strong></span>: A VR <span>illustration</span><a id="id325563574" class="indexterm"></a> tool (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.facebook.com/QuillApp/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/QuillApp/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Kudon</strong></span>: Surface and <span>volume</span><a id="id325563592" class="indexterm"></a> sculpting (<a class="ulink" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/479010/Kodon/)" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/479010/Kodon/)</a></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>MasterpieceVR</strong></span>: VR sculpting <span>and</span><a id="id325567575" class="indexterm"></a> painting (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.masterpiecevr.com/" target="_blank">https://www.masterpiecevr.com/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Microsoft Paint 3D</strong></span>: Easy 3D sculpting <span>and</span><a id="id325567593" class="indexterm"></a> painting bundled free with Windows (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99</a>)</li></ul></div><p>Making stuff and playing with it in VR is creative and fun, but to be useful and productive, you need to be able to share your creations outside of the app. Most VR sculpting tools let you export the models to share on the Internet, export in FBX file format, for example, and import them into Unity. There are two different workflows to do this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Export/Import</strong></span>: In the first workflow you make a model and export it to a compatible format, like FBX. This is akin to traditional 3D software like we did with Blender.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Publish/Import</strong></span>: The second workflow is to upload it to a sharing service and subsequently download and install it into your Unity project.</li></ul></div><p>In this section, we will use Tilt Brush as an example. Suppose you have Google Tilt Brush and a compatible VR rig. Further, suppose you have a creation you'd like to integrate with your VR app with Unity. Let's walk through each workflow process.</p><p>I opened Tilt Brush in VR and created a masterpiece using the Paper ribbon brush. I call it <span class="emphasis"><em>TiltBox</em></span>, consistent with the cube theme we're using in this chapter. I know, it's beautiful.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>The Tilt Brush features and user interface presented here (at the time of writing) are considered by Google to be in beta or experimental and are subject to change by the <span>time you read this.</span></p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/92e36b44-6cca-49b7-a24e-505a4964ac29.png" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Exporting and importing Tilt Brush models</h3></div></div></div><p>We are going to export our model as FBX and then <span>import</span><a id="id325572841" class="indexterm"></a> it into Unity.
