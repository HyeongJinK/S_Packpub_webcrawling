We started by examining Unity's components that support conventional third-person and first-person characters and quickly realized most of those capabilities are not too useful in VR. For instance, we don't want the app to bob our head up and down as we walk, and we don't necessarily want to go jumping off buildings either. Moving around is important, but player comfort is more so. You don't want to induce motion sickness.</p><p>Locomotion is moving smoothly and linearly across the scene, akin to walking. Using gaze-based mechanics, we implemented moving in the direction you're looking and used input buttons to start and stop. Then, we separated the locomotion from head direction, always moving "forward" and using a separate input (thumbpad) to change the angle our body is facing. With this <span class="emphasis"><em>comfort mode</em></span>, you can locomote and still look around. </p><p>Jumping to a new location is called teleportation. We started again with a gaze-based mechanic, letting you select a teleport location where you're looking. We implemented a couple ways of constraining where you are allowed to teleport, using NavMesh and using teleport spawn points. Then, we looked at some teleportation toolkits, from SteamVR and Google Daydream, which provide a rich set of capabilities, as well as a juicy user experience that is not trivial to implement from scratch. If you're targeting a different platform, such as Oculus, there are similar tools.</p><p>In <span>the next chapter</span>,<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>we'll explore the Unity physics engine more and implement some interactive games. </p></div>
