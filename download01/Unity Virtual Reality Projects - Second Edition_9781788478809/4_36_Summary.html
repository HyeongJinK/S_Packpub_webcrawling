We first made Ethan (the zombie) walk randomly around the scene and enabled him to move by using a NavMesh, but then we directed his wanderings using a 3D cursor on the <strong class="userinput"><code>x</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>z</code></strong> ground plane. This cursor follows our gaze as we look around the scene in virtual reality. Lastly, we also used our gaze to shoot a ray at Ethan, causing him to lose health and eventually explode.</p><p>These look-based techniques can be used in non-VR games, but in VR, it's very common and almost essential. We'll be using them more in the later chapters ofÂ this book too.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will use our hands to interact with the virtual scene. We will learn about Unity Input events, as well as input systems for SteamVR, Oculus, and Windows Mixed Reality, to name a few. As this can get complicated, we'll write our own VR input event system to keep our application independent of the specific VR devices.</p></div>
