Most VR devices provide a hand controller to select, grab, and interact with virtual objects in the scene.</p><p>In this chapter, we introduce practices for capturing user input in Unity, illustrating how to use them in a simple VR scene. Everyone loves balloons, so in this project we will make balloons. We may even pop a few. We will continue from the previous chapter, using C# programming for basic scripting, and explore several software design patterns for user input. We will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Polling for input device data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using scriptable data objects for storing and retrieving input state</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Invoking and subscribing to input events</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using interactable components provided with device-specific Unity packages</li></ul></div><p>An important lesson we will learn in this chapter is there is not just one way to handle user input for your VR application. There isn't even one <span class="emphasis"><em>best way</em></span>. Unity includes several mechanisms for handling user input and, in general, messaging between objects. VR device manufacturers provide their own input controller objects and scripts for their SDK.</p><p>Furthermore, VR manufacturers and others offer convenient framework toolkits with higher-level components and prefabs. We recommend you become familiar with the toolkits provided for your target device. Study the demo scenes to see how the components work and their recommended practices, as we will do at the end of this chapter. </p><p>That said, in this chapter we will start with the very simple button press input, and progress from there, showing various design patterns. You won't always want to roll your own, but you should have an understanding of how things work.</p></div>
