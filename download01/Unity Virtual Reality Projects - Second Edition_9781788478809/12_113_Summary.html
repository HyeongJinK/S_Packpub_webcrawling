We built a simple scene and an avatar, keeping in mind that the intent is to allow the avatar's head movement to be synchronized with the player's head-mounted display.</p><p>We then converted the scene to multiplayer, adding the Unity Network components, which simplifies the multiplayer implementation to just a handful of clicks. Having proven we can build a shared multiplayer experience with the avatars, we added a bouncy ball game object shared between players, providing the fundamentals for building a multiplayer networked game.</p><p>Next, we took a quick spin of the Oculus Avatar SDKs, replacing our spherical avatars with full bodied personalized ones from the Oculus Platform ecosystem. Finally, we stepped through how easy it is to create a virtual room in VRChat by exporting a scene that you can share almost instantly.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will dive into the technical details of optimizing your VR projects to run smoothly and comfortably in VR. We will consider the different areas that affect performance and latency, from model polygon count, to Unity scripting, to bottlenecks on the CPU and GPU processors.</p><p> </p></div>
