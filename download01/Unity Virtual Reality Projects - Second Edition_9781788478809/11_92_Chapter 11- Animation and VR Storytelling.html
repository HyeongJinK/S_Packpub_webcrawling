Many of the tools and lessons we cover in this chapter can also be used with 360 media, but we're going to focus on 3D computer graphics and animation here.</p><p>For this project, we are going to create a little VR experience, a simplistic story about a bird who gains its wings and learns to fly.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to learn about the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Importing and using external models and animations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using Unity Timelines to activate and animate objects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Animation editor window for editing property keyframes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Controlling Animation Clips with an Animation Controller</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Making the story interactive </li></ul></div></div>
