It is a fact that VR can cause motion sickness. </p><p>The symptoms of motion sickness are nausea, sweating, headaches, even vomiting. It can take hours, perhaps an overnight sleep, to recover. In real life, humans are susceptible to motion sickness: riding a roller coaster, a bumpy airplane, a rocking boat. It's caused when one part of the balance-sensing system thinks your body is moving but other parts don't.</p><p>In VR, this could occur when the eyes see motion but your body doesn't sense it. We've considered ways you can design your VR apps to avoid this. With locomotion, always give the user control over their first person movement. Try to avoid riding-the-rails experiences and especially avoid free-falling. Include using a horizon line or dashboard in the foreground so at least the player feels they're grounded in a cockpit if not on solid ground. </p><p>The opposite is also true: when you body feels motion but your eyes don't see it.  Even very subtle discord can have a bad effect. In VR, a major culprit is latency. If you move your head but the view you see doesn't keep up with the movement, that can cause nausea. </p><p>Although this chapter is at the end of this book, we do not mean to suggest that performance issues be left for the end of your project implementation. The old adage "first get it to work, then get it to work faster" doesn't necessarily apply to VR development. You need to pay attention to performance and comfort throughout your development process, which we will address as the main topics in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing your artwork and 3D models</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing your scene and lighting</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing your code</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimizing the rendering with shaders and settings</li></ul></div><p>Key tools in analyzing and diagnosing performance issues are the built-in Unity Profiler and Stats windows. We will start with a quick introduction to these.</p></div>
