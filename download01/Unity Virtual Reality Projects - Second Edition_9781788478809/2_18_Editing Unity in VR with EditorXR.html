We also <span>learned</span><a id="id325549813" class="indexterm"></a> a bit about Blender—a tool for creating 3D assets on at 2D computer screen. Then we progressed to the <span>new</span><a id="id325549821" class="indexterm"></a> generation of 3D asset creation tools in virtual reality including Tilt Brush and Poly. Now we'll explore creating VR scenes directly in virtual reality too!</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Unity EditorXR</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>EXR</strong></span>) is a new experimental feature of Unity (at time of writing) where you can edit your 3D scenes directly in VR <span>rather</span><a id="id325552376" class="indexterm"></a> than on your 2D monitor. In this section, we may be getting ahead of ourselves in more ways than one. This is both an advanced topic and an experimental one. If you are just getting started with VR, or if you are just getting started with Unity, you may want to skip this topic for now and come back at a later time.</p><p>EXR is an advanced topic because it assumes you are comfortable with using the Unity Editor windows, are used to thinking in 3D, and are somewhat experienced in working with 3D assets. It also assumes you have a VR rig with tracking hand controllers, like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. You will need a powerful PC with a high-end graphics card if you hope to have any chance of a smooth, comfortable experience. And last but not least, some of EXR's user interaction conventions take some learning and getting used to.</p><p>Despite that, EXR is a pretty sweet project that you could start using today to be productive. Especially if you're not afraid of software that is experimental. This also means that the UI we describe in this book is certainly subject to change. (For example, at this moment in time the package is being rebranded from EditorVR to EditorXR and EXR).

One hand holds your menu palette and the other picks functions from it. <span>Like a boxy glove</span>, you can change menus with the flick of your thumb to rotate menu box faces. That’s the starting point but EXR is ever more complex, as it needs to provide the rich set of Unity Editor features in your virtual workspace, compounded with the need to navigate the scene, organize your editor panels, and of course edit your scene game objects. We encourage you to watch a few demo videos before jumping in.</p><p>The hand controller selectors implement an innovative, simultaneous combination of laser pointers for picking distant objects and grabbing (via a <span class="emphasis"><em>selection cone</em></span>) for objects within reach, as illustrated here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/d749eea4-2589-4c41-a634-9073a9739933.png" /></div><p></p><p>To manipulate objects, EXR has implemented robust 3D versions of the familiar scene editor widgets in the 2D Editor. They’re really quite powerful and easy to use.</p><p>Without going into much further detail, here are the key features in EXR editor:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Selection</strong></span>: Robust use of the hand controller thumbpad/stick, buttons, trigger, and grib</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Menus</strong></span>: Boxed glove menu panels, radial menu, shortcuts, and tools to organize panels in 3D</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Navigation</strong></span>: Move throughout your scene as you work, fly and blink modes, rotate in place, scale the world, use a mini-world view</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Workspaces</strong></span>: <span>Correspond to windows in the 2D editor, for Project, Hierarchy, Inspector, Console, Profile, and more, can be opened and placed in the VR work area</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Other features <span>include locked objects, snapping,</span></li></ul></div><p>The following diagram shows how the manipulator Gizmo can be used for direct manipulation of the current selected object, in conjunction with the radial menu on your controller, to switch tools:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/5834c53c-c533-4653-96ec-f5390e2bfcb3.png" /></div><p></p><p>Perhaps one of the more challenging <span>things</span><a id="id325581662" class="indexterm"></a> to learn in EXR is what each of the hand controls do as they switch meaning depending on the current context. The following diagram shows the controller guides for the VIVE:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/3e3f84e3-dd79-4e53-83de-f40763ff9a11.png" /></div><p>Controller guides for the Oculus touch are shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/c75d68af-35f5-4534-9beb-7f221afaf8e9.png" /></div><p></p><p>To wrap up this topic, you can even use Google Poly to find objects and insert them into your scene in VR. An example of the third-party extensions of the EditorXR interface and API, the Poly workspace is available in VR. If you have the Poly Toolkit installed (as discussed) and you are using EditorXR, then Poly is one of the available workspaces. Open it to browse and add 3D models from <span>the</span><a id="id325581696" class="indexterm"></a> cloud into your scene, as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/18454b60-2830-4b9f-8a62-b13d253a8d6f.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>To learn more about EditorXR and Google Poly see this debut blog post by Matt Schoen of Unity Labs: <a class="ulink" href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/11/30/learn-how-googles-poly-works-with-unity-editorxr/" target="_blank">https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/11/30/learn-how-googles-poly-works-with-unity-editorxr/</a>.
