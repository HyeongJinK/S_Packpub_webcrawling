If this interests you, I recommend you look closely at the Unity manual and go through their tutorials too. As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, a good place to start is the Unity Networking Concepts document (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetConcepts.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetConcepts.html</a>). </p><p>It's important to understand Peer-to-Peer versus Client-Server versus Dedicated Server networking architecture. As we've seen, by default Unity Networking is Client-Server, with a player as the host Server (the player is also its own Client). You also have the option of setting up with a dedicated server running Unity as a standalone player in headless mode. </p><p>Some other networking topics and issues include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Synchronizing <span>other</span><a id="id325317297" class="indexterm"></a> serializable state variables (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetStateSync.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetStateSync.html</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Client custom spawn functions (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetCustomSpawning.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetCustomSpawning.html</a>)  </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Spawning and controlling non-player characters (NPC) from a server</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Further understanding when to use local player authority versus server authority (<a class="ulink" href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1440902/unet-local-player-authority.html" target="_blank">https://answers.unity.com/questions/1440902/unet-local-player-authority.html</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Calling Commands (client to server) versus  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (server to client) (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetActions.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetActions.html</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building your own multiplayer lobby (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetLobby.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetLobby.html</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Testing, debugging, and simulating networking conditions (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetManager.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetManager.html</a>)</li></ul></div><p>Networking is not specifically a VR topic, but if you do embark on building a multiplayer networked VR application, you should spend time gaining an understanding of how data, messages, and commands are exchanged between client and server. VR includes its own unique networking challenges. The immediate, immersive experience of VR can amplify problems of latency, synchronization, and realism. We will also address some of these issues in the next chapter.</p></div>
