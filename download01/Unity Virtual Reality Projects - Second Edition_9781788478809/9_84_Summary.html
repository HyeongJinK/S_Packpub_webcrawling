We imported the model into Unity and added some environmental lighting. Then, we built an artwork rig consisting of an image, a picture frame, and a spotlight, and placed instances of the rig on various walls throughout the gallery. Next, we imported a bunch of personal photos and wrote a script that populates the art frames at runtime. Adding more detailed data about each artwork, we explored several ways of managing lists of non-graphical data. Finally, we added the ability to move around within the art gallery level, via teleportation and an automated first-person walkthrough of the scene.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at a different kind of VR experience using pre-recorded 360-degree media. You will build and learn about photospheres, equirectangular projections, and infographics.</p></div>
