The requirements are not specific to virtual reality; these are the same steps <span>required</span><a id="id325577566" class="indexterm"></a> by anyone <span>building</span><a id="id325577575" class="indexterm"></a> any iOS app from Unity. The process is also well documented elsewhere, including the Unity documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/iphone-GettingStarted.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/iphone-GettingStarted.html</a>.</p><p>A requirement of Apple's closed ecosystem is you must use a Mac as your development machine to develop for iOS. That’s just the way it is. The upside is the setup process is very straightforward.</p><p>At the time of writing, the only VR apps that will run on iOS are Google Cardboard.</p><p>The steps include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Have an Apple ID</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Install Xcode</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Configure the Unity Player Settings for iOS</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Build And Run</li></ul></div><p>OK, let's take a bite of this apple.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec52"></a>Have an Apple ID</h3></div></div></div><p>To develop for iOS you need a Mac computer to <span>develop</span><a id="id325547513" class="indexterm"></a> on, and an Apple ID to log into the App Store. This will permit you to build iOS apps that run on your personal device.</p><p>It is also recommended that you have an Apple Developer account. It costs $99 USD per year but is your admission ticket to the tools and services including setup provisioning profiles needed to share and test your app on other devices.

First, ensure <span class="emphasis"><em>iOS</em></span> is your target platform in Build Settings. Unity provides a great deal of support for iOS, including configuration and optimization for runtime features and the capabilities of mobile devices. These options can be found in Player Settings. We only need to set a couple of them now (the minimum required to build our projects):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>In Unity, navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code><span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span><strong class="userinput"><code><span class="strong"><strong>ile</strong></span></code></strong></code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code><span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span></code></strong> and examine the <strong class="userinput"><code>Platform</code></strong> pane.

An ID is required for all iOS apps. Typically, it is in the format <code class="literal">com.CompanyName.ProductName</code>. It must be unique on the target device, and eventually, unique in the App Store.
