Along the way, we explore managing objects, Rigidbody physics, and adding more interactivity to the virtual experience. You will see how properties and materials based on physics can be added to objects, as well as more on C# scripting, particle effects, and music.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Unity physics engine, the Unity Rigidbody component, and Physic Materials</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using velocity and gravity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Managing object lifetime and object pooling</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Interacting with objects in VR using your head and hands</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building a fireball using particle effects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Synchronizing with music </li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip76"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that the projects in this chapter are separate and are not directly required by the other chapters in this book.
