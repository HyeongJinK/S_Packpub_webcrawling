First, we explained in layman's terms the relationship between Rigidbody, Colliders, and Physic Materials, and explored how the physics engine uses these to determine the velocity and collision of objects in the scene.</p><p>Then, we considered the life cycle of game objects and implemented an object pooler that helps avoid memory fragmentation and garbage collection, which can lead to performance problems and VR discomfort.</p><p>Using what we learned, we implemented several variations of a ball game, first aiming for a target with your head, then using hand paddles. We modified the game so that, instead of serving balls from above-using gravity, we shoot them from in front and apply a velocity vector. Lastly, we juiced up our game, changing the bouncy balls into fireballs, adding a cool level environment, and synchronizing the fireballs to music beats. In the end, we have a good start to making our own version of the Audio Shield VR game.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will see another more practical example of a virtual interactive space. We are going to build an interactive art gallery space that you can move through and query the artwork for information and details.</p></div>
