A lot of work has been done over the past few decades, and more so in the past few years.</p><p>With consumer VR devices so readily available, and powerful development tools like Unity, it's not surprising there are many people inventing and trying new things, innovating continuously, and producing really excellent VR experiences. You are probably one of them. But the context of today's VR is not a vacuum. There is a history of research and development that feeds into present-day work.  The book <span class="emphasis"><em>3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice</em></span> (Bowman et al), for example, is a classic academic survey of 3D user interaction for consumer, industrial, and scientific applications and research. Originally published in 2004, the second edition was published in 2017 (LaViola et al) and is an up-to-date review of academic theory and practical principles. </p><p>Current writings for VR design are more accessible. An easy to read <span>but</span><a id="id325567580" class="indexterm"></a> practical introduction to VR user experience design is the Medium article <span class="emphasis"><em>Get started with VR: user experience design</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://medium.com/vrinflux-dot-com/get-started-with-vr-user-experience-design-974486cf9d18" target="_blank">https://medium.com/vrinflux-dot-com/get-started-with-vr-user-experience-design-974486cf9d18</a>) by Adrienne Hunter, co-creator of the popular VR physics package, NewtonVR. She identifies some important core principles, including It's like theatre in the round, drawing attention with to objects, lighting, and audio cues, and designing space for height and accessibility.</p><p>Another great article is <span class="emphasis"><em>Practical VR: A Design Cheat Sheet</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://virtualrealitypop.com/practical-vr-ce80427e8e9d" target="_blank">https://virtualrealitypop.com/practical-vr-ce80427e8e9d</a>). This is intended to be a living primer with VR design guidelines, process, tools <span>and</span><a id="id325567606" class="indexterm"></a> other resources the author intends to maintain and update.</p><p>One of my favorite studies of design for VR is the <span class="emphasis"><em>VR Interface Design Pre-Visualization Methods</em></span> produced by Mike Algers as a grad student in 2015. His inspiring video at <a class="ulink" href="https://vimeo.com/141330081" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/141330081</a> presents an easily digestible thesis of design principles, especially for seated VR experiences, based on established ergonomics of workspaces and visual perception. We'll use some of these ideas in this chapter. Algers also explores button design for VR, mockup workflows, and concepts for VR operating system design. (Algers presently works in the Google VR development group.)</p><p>In his thesis, Algers establishes a set of comfort zones radially around the user's first-person location, as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/2fd1d5ff-c0b4-4fc1-b92f-ac1daa03af0e.png" /></div><p></p><p>Anything closer than <strong class="userinput"><code>0.5 m</code></strong> is too close for comfort; you might have to cross your eyes just to focus and follow objects at that range. Beyond <strong class="userinput"><code>20 m</code></strong> is too far way to have meaningful interactions, and is also too far for depth perception with parallax. Your <strong class="userinput"><code>Peripheral Zones</code></strong> (<strong class="userinput"><code>77</code></strong>–<strong class="userinput"><code>102</code></strong> degrees) should not contain primary content and interactions but can have secondary ones. <span>Behind you he calls the <strong class="userinput"><code>Curiosity Zone</code></strong>, you'd need to stretch (or swivel your chair or turn around) to see what's going on there so it'd better be important yet not imperative</span>. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Content Zone</code></strong> is your normal workspace. Then, accounting for arm reach (forward, up, and down) and other normal human movement in a workspace, Algers defines the optimal virtual work zone for seated VR experience as shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788478809/graphics/04ac6d04-6517-4264-8b74-df223953e26a.png" /></div><p>For standing and room-scale VR, the workspace is different. When standing, it may be much easier (and expected) to be able to turn around to access things all around you. With room-scale, you can walk around (and jump, duck, and crawl, for that matter). Alex Schwartz and Devin Reimer of Owlchemy Labs (since acquired by Google), in their talk at Oculus Connect 2 ( <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjc7AJwZ4DI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjc7AJwZ4DI</a>), discuss the challenges of designing standing VR experiences for their popular Job Simulator, including accommodation for real-world ergonomics and varied height experiences. </p><p>Some other great resources on designing for virtual reality include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Oculus's series of articles on VR design best practices, including on user input (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/bp-userinput/" target="_blank">https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/bp-userinput/</a>) which includes recommendations on movement, button mapping, menus, and using your hands in VR.
