You will learn about the following in this book:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>World scale</strong></span>: When building for a VR experience, attention to the 3D space and scale is important. One unit in Unity is usually equal to one meter in the virtual world.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>First-person controls</strong></span>: There are various techniques that can be used to control the movement of your avatar (first-person camera), gaze-based selection, tracked hand input controllers, and head movements.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>User interface </strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>controls</strong></span>: Unlike conventional video (and mobile) games, all user interface components are in world coordinates in VR, not screen coordinates. We'll explore ways to present notices, buttons, selectors, and other <span class="strong"><strong>user interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span>) controls <span>to</span><a id="id325567250" class="indexterm"></a> the users so that they can interact and make selections.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Physics and gravity</strong></span>: Critical to the sense of presence and immersion in VR is the physics and gravity of the world. We'll use the Unity physics engine to our advantage.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span>: Moving objects within the scene is called <span class="emphasis"><em>animation</em></span>—duh! It can either be along predefined paths or it may use AI (artificial intelligence) scripting that follows a logical algorithm in response to events in the environment.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Multi-user services</strong></span>: Real-time networking and <span>multi-user games</span> are not easy to implement, but online services make it easy without you having to be a computer engineer.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>run and optimize</strong></span>: Different HMDs use different developer kits SDK and assets to build applications that target a specific device. We'll consider techniques that let you use a single interface for multiple devices. Understanding the rendering pipeline and how to optimize performance is a critical skill for VR development.</li></ul></div><p>We will write scripts in the C# language and use features of Unity as and when they are needed to get things done.</p><p>However, there are technical areas that we will not cover, such as realistic rendering, shaders, materials, and lighting. We will not go into modeling techniques, terrains, or humanoid animations. We also won't discuss game mechanics, dynamics, and strategies. All of these are very important topics that may be necessary for you to learn (or for someone in your team), in addition to this book, to build complete, successful and immersive VR applications.</p><p>So let's see what does this book actually covers and who does it caters to.</p></div>
