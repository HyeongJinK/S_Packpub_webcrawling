How are metallic and specular materials set up to respond differently to light? We will answer these questions as we work through the objectives in this chapter.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Comparing metallic and specular workflows</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussing shader dependence on lighting and reflection data</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding new properties to a shader</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding and utilizing unique UV coordinates</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Accessing and modifying shader properties with scripts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Modifying material instances at runtime</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Locating and utilizing Unity's built-in shader assets in <code class="literal">CGIncludes</code>
</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's take a look at how metallic and specular features can be added manually and what kind of surfaces we can achieve outside the Standard Shader's range.</p><p>At this point in the game, our character reaches the damaged research station and prepares to enter. From outside, the research center appears to be intact.</p></div>
