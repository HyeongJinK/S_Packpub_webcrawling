With the metallic shader workflow, we created a custom decal material for the scene's crate asset. We then demonstrated how the decal could be varied among different crate game objects in the scene at runtime with the help of a little coding.</p><p>With the specular workflow, we took a look at Unity's built-in lighting models and incorporated the necessary code in our own custom shader to utilize specular lighting effects.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a closer look at shader creation for organic surfaces, such as hair and skin.</p></div>
