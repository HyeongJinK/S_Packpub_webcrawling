We then explored the options for creating emissive materials with Unity's Standard Shader.</p><p>We also demonstrated how the Standard Shader can be used to emit light in the scene and what impact this has on a variety of surfaces.</p><p>Within the context of our spacecraft bridge scene, we created a custom wireframe shader to represent a projected scan visualization of the planet's surface. We completed the chapter by adding further effects to complete the look of the spacecraft bridge.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will demonstrate how these shader effects can be animated and controlled during gameplay with the use of a little external code and a closer look at the shaders.</p></div>
