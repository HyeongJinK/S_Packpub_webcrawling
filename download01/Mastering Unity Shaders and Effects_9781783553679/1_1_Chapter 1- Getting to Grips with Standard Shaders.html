The Standard Shaders utilize physically-based rendering.</p><p>Before the Standard Shader arrangement, specialized shaders were required to create transparent, reflective, and metallic materials. This made including a lot of different surfaces in a single game scene problematic—each shader is essentially a small program that needs to be run, negatively impacting the performance.</p><p>The Standard Shaders offer a universal approach—they can be reflective, transparent, metallic, and all of these. Unused map channels are discarded at runtime, making for an efficient shader and reduced performance time.</p><p>Combined with Unity's versatile <span class="strong"><strong>Enlighten</strong></span> lighting solution, Standard Shaders allow for more responsive, realistic surfaces in a game scene.</p><p>We will compare the Standard Shader metallic and specular workflows, and offer different opportunities to use both within our game context.</p><p>This chapter will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussing the project setup and importing a custom Asset Package</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating complex materials to cover a variety of surfaces</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Defining specular and metallic values using sliders and texture maps</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Utilizing material groups on imported models</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Making surfaces transparent</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Layering materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussing key differences between Standard (metallic) and standard specular workflows</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussing Skybox asset creation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discussing basic scene light adjustment</p></li></ul></div><p>Throughout this book, we will develop an understanding of shaders and the effects within the context of a next generation science-fiction horror game.</p><p>In the game, a lone astronaut journeys in her spacecraft to a distant planet, <span class="strong"><strong>Ridley VI</strong></span>, to make contact with a research team after communication with the team was mysteriously cut off.</p><p>This context will give us plenty of opportunities to explore the use of shaders and effects in a game development setting.</p><p>Let's get to work!</p></div>
