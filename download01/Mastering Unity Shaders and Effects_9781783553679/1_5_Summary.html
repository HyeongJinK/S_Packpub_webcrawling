We used the transparent option in another standard material to make the astronaut's helmet transparent.</p><p>For the spacecraft's material, we explored an additional layer technique in order to blend together different surface qualities.</p><p>We introduced the Standard specular workflow and used a specular material for the planet, defining colored specularity on the planet's surface.</p><p>After this, we created a custom skybox as the backdrop for our scene, adjusted scene lighting, and then added some appealing effects to the scene.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a step beyond the Standard Shader, adding animation and additional effects.</p></div>
