The interior of the spacecraft is lit with glowing lights and displays.</p><p>This scene already has standard materials applied. We will demonstrate how some of the surfaces interact with light before we examine the specific qualities in our own shader.</p><p>We will start by looking at the existing scene lights.</p></div>
