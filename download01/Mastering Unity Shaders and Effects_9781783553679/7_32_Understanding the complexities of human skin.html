For added realism, we will create a new shader that more closely approximates the physical properties of human skin.</p><p>Human skin is partially translucent, rather than reflecting light in the same way as a typical opaque material. Some light is scattered around in the underlying, or epidermal, layers. This often means that skin appears lighter in all but extremely low-light conditions.</p><p>In game graphics, we do not usually have the resources to recreate the underlying layers of skin in human characters, we have to try and accomplish the effect by varying the surface's response to light in our shader output.</p><p>In this case, we will set up a standard specular material and add a subtle emissive quality to the surface.</p></div>
