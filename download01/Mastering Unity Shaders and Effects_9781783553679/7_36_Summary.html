We created a custom shader to manipulated the pupil scale.</p><p>For the hair, we created a custom anisotropic lighting effect to emphasize the strands of the hair using a normal map.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at how shaders can be created for eye catching particle effects in our game.</p></div>
