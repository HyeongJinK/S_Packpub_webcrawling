This can be a bit of an intimidating place for some developers, since many picked Unity as their solution primarily to avoid the kind of low-level grunt work that comes from engine development and memory management. They would prefer instead to focus on higher-level concerns related to gameplay implementation, level design, and art asset management.</p><p>Many games of limited scope can get away with focusing on such higher-level concerns, at the cost of wasted resources, and may never run into any problems related to memory. This is all well and good until the day it becomes a problem. At this point, their neglect in understanding the important components of the engine leads to a scramble to find solutions that can be difficult to understand and implement without proper knowledge to back it up.</p><p>Therefore, understanding what is happening with memory allocations and C# language features, how they interact with the Mono Platform, how Mono interacts with the underlying engine, and the various libraries we have available are absolutely paramount to making high-quality, efficient script code. So, in this chapter, you will learn about all of the nuts and bolts of the underlying Unity Engine, Mono Platform, C# language, and .NET Framework.</p><p>Let's start by exploring the familiar part of the engine, which handles most of the work for our game's scripting code—the Mono platform.</p></div>
