Some of these techniques demand some forethought and profiling investigation before being implemented, since they often come with introducing additional risks or obfuscating our codebase for new developers. Workflow is often just as important as performance and design, so before you make any performance changes to the code, you should consider whether or not you're sacrificing too much on the altar of performance optimization.</p><p>We will investigate more advanced scripting improvement techniques later, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Masterful Memory Management</em></span>, but let's take a break from staring at code and explore some ways to improve application performance using built-in Unity features such as Static and Dynamic Batching.</p></div>
