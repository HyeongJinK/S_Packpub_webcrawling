Or, from another perspective, there are plenty of ways to ruin our application's performance through asset mismanagement.</p><p>Almost every single opportunity is a trade-off between one performance metric or workflow task and another. So, we must remain vigilant and only pick the right techniques in the right projects for the right reasons. The worst thing we can do is implement such changes without understanding the impact. It's exciting to stumble on some big performance enhancing suggestion out in the big, wide world, but unless we understand how it works, and the resulting costs, we can invite further performance problems and bottlenecks without realizing it, costing us more time and effort down the road.</p><p>This concludes our exploration of improving performance through art asset manipulation. In the next chapter, we will be investigating the Box2D and PhysX physics solutions provided by Unity, the changes we can make to our script code, Scene, and project to make these components process our data faster; and behavior to avoid that might cause them to stumble.</p></div>
