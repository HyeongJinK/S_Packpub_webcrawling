The best technique when it comes to costly systems such as Physics Engines is simply avoidance. The less we need to use the system, the less we need to worry about it generating bottlenecks. In the worst case, we may need to reduce the scope of our game to condense physics activity down to only the essentials, but as we've learned, there are plenty of ways to reduce physics complexity without causing any noticeable gameplay effects.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will immerse ourselves in Unity's graphics system, discovering how to maximize graphical fidelity using all of the CPU cycles we've freed up using the performance enhancements from earlier chapters.</p></div>
