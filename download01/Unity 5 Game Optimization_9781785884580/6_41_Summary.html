That was a lot of information to absorb for just one component of the Unity Engine, but then it is clearly the most complicated of them all, requiring a matching depth of explanation. Hopefully, you've learned a lot of approaches to help you improve your rendering performance and enough about the rendering pipeline to know how to use them responsibly!</p><p>By now we should be used to the idea that, with the exception of algorithm improvements, every performance enhancement we implement will come with some related cost that we must be willing to bear for the sake of removing one bottleneck. We should also be ready to implement multiple techniques until we've squashed them all.</p><p>We've just covered a very abstract system in great detail, so let's move things along with an exploration of a more concrete system: Unity's underlying Engine and the C# language. In the next chapter, we will take a look at our Script code in a more advanced light and investigate some methods to improve our CPU and memory management.</p></div>
