It can be difficult to say whether one piece of art is "better" than the other, and it's likely that we won't be able to find complete consensus on our opinions. The technical aspects behind art assets that support a game's artistry can also be very subjective. There are multiple workarounds that can be implemented to improve performance, but these tend to result in a loss of quality for the sake of speed. If we're trying to reach peak performance, then it's important that we consult with our team members whenever we decide to make any changes to our art assets as it is primarily a balancing act, which can be an art form in itself.</p><p>Whether we're trying to minimize our runtime memory footprint, keeping the smallest possible executable size, maximizing loading speed, or maintaining consistency in frame rate, there are plenty of options to explore. There are some methods that are clearly always ideal, and others which may require a little more care and forethought before being adopted, as they might result in reduced quality or increase the chances of developing bottlenecks in other components.</p><p>We will begin examining audio files, followed by Texture files, and finish up with meshes and animations. In each case, we will investigate how Unity loads, stores, and manipulates these assets during runtime, what our options are, and what we can do to avoid behavior that might generate performance bottlenecks.</p></div>
