However, quite a lot of the Editor's functionality is not well documented, well known, or just not something we think about until after the fact that it could have been applied perfectly to solve a particular problem we were having 6 months ago.</p><p>The Internet is crammed full of blogs and forum posts that try to help other Unity developers learn about these useful features, but they only tend to focus on a handful of tips at a time. There don't seem to be any online resources that group together many of them in one place. As a result, intermediate and advanced users probably have bookmarked managers bursting at the seams with links to these tips that they run into at one point or another, but which sit and rot until it comes time to do some spring cleaning.</p><p>So, because this book is primarily for intermediate and advanced users, it felt like it was worth throwing in a short chapter to bring tons of these tips and tricks together in one location. It works as a reference list in the hope of saving us a lot of future development effort.</p></div>
