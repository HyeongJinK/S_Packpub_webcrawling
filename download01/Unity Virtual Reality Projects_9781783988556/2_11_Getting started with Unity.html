The fully-featured <span class="strong"><strong>Personal Edition</strong></span> is free and runs on both Windows<a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a> and Mac. To get Unity, go to <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/</a>, select the version that you want, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Download Installer</strong></span>, and continue following the instructions. This book assumes version 5.1 of Unity.</p><p>For you beginners out there, we're going to take this first section nice and slow, with more hand-holding than what you'll get later on in the book. Furthermore, even if you already know Unity and have developed your own games, it may be worthwhile revisiting the fundamental concepts, since the rules sometimes are different when designing for virtual reality.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"></a>Starting a new Unity project</h3></div></div></div><p>Create a <a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a>new Unity project named <code class="literal">VR_is_Awesome</code>, or whatever you'd like.</p><p>To create a new Unity project, launch Unity from your operating system, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> dialog box will appear. From this dialog box, select <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span>, which opens a <span class="strong"><strong>New project</strong></span> dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_02.jpg" /></div><p>Fill in the name of your project and verify that the folder location is what you want.

Here's a brief explanation of each panel that is shown in the preceding layout image (your layout may be different):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel on the upper left-hand side (highlighted) is where you can visually compose the 3D space of the current scene, including the placement of objects.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Below<a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel (lower left-hand side) is the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view, which shows the actual game camera view (presently, it is empty with an ambient sky). When in <span class="strong"><strong>Play Mode</strong></span>, your game runs in this panel.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In the center are the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panels (from the top to the bottom) respectively. The <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel provides a tree view of all the objects in the current scene.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel contains all the reusable resources for the project, including the ones imported as well as those that you'll create along the way.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel shows messages from Unity, including warnings and errors from code scripts.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>On the right-hand side is the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel (highlighted), which contains the properties of the currently selected object. (Objects are selected by clicking on them in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, or the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel). The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel has separate panes for each component of the object.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>At the top is the main menu bar (on a Mac, this will be at the top of your screen, not at the top of the Unity window). There's a toolbar area with various controls that we'll use later on, including the <span class="emphasis"><em>play</em></span> (triangle icon) button that starts Play Mode.</p></li></ul></div><p>From the <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>main menu bar <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> menu, you can open additional panels, as needed. The editor's user interface is configurable. Each panel can be rearranged, resized, and tabbed by grabbing one of the panel tabs and dragging it. Go ahead, try it! On the upper right-hand side is a <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> selector that lets you either choose between various default layouts, or save your own preferences.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"></a>The default world space</h3></div></div></div><p>A <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>default empty Unity scene consists of a <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> component and a single <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> component, as listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and depicted in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel. The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel also shows a perspective of an infinite reference ground plane grid, like a piece of graph paper with nothing on it yet. The grid spans across the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (red) and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> (blue) axes. The <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis (green) is up.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"></a>Note</h3><p>An easy way to remember the gizmo axis colors is by keeping in mind that R-G-B corresponds to X-Y-Z.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel shows the details of the currently selected item: Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> with your mouse, either from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> list or within the scene itself, and look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel for each of the properties and components associated with the object, including its transform. An object's transform specifies its position, rotation, and scale in the 3D world space. For example, a (0, 3, 0) position is 3 units above (Y direction) the center of the ground plane (<span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> = 0, <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> = 0). A rotation of (50, 330, 0) means that it's rotated 50 degrees around the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-axis and 330 degrees around the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis. As you'll see, you can change an object's transforms numerically here or directly with the mouse in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel.</p><p>Similarly, if you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, it may be located at the (0, 1, -10) position with no rotation. That is, it's pointed straight ahead, towards the positive Z direction.</p><p>When you select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, as shown in the preceding editor screenshot, a <span class="strong"><strong>Camera Preview</strong></span> inset is added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> panel, which shows the view that the camera <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>presently sees. (If the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab is open, you'll see the same view there too). Presently, the view is empty and the reference grid does not get rendered, but a foggy horizon is discernible, with the grey ground plane below and the blue default ambient <span class="strong"><strong>Skybox</strong></span> above.</p></div></div>
