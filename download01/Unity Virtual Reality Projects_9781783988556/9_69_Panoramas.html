Let's try this and map it onto a cylinder.</p><p>I was in Los Angeles last year. I hiked to the top of the Hollywood sign, where I took two 180-degree panoramic images with my phone, and later I quickly stitched them together in Gimp. The <code class="literal">Hollywood.png</code> image is included with this book, or you can use your own panorama:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_09_04.jpg" /></div><p>Putting it together, using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Move <code class="literal">Sphere 2</code> out of the way and set its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">-3, 1.5, 0</code>).</p></li><li><p>Create a new cylinder by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span>, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0, 1.5, 0</code>), and name it <code class="literal">Cylinder 3</code>.</p></li><li><p>Set the<a id="id526" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">2, 0.5, 2</code>).</p></li><li><p>Disable its <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule Collider</strong></span> component by unchecking the checkbox.</p></li><li><p>Drag the <code class="literal">Hollywood</code> texture onto the cylinder.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that the <code class="literal">Cylinder 3</code> object is selected. On its <code class="literal">Hollywood</code> material component in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>InwardShader</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>A default cylinder in Unity is 2 units tall and 1 unit wide (a radius of 0.5 units). My image has a resolution of 5242 x 780, which is an aspect ratio of about 6.75:1. How big should the cylinder be to respect this aspect ratio and not distort the image? If you set <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.5</code> to normalize the height to 1.0 unit, then we need a circumference of 6.75 units. Given <span class="emphasis"><em>circumference = 2 ‚àè r</em></span>, then <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> should be 1.0 units. So, we set the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform </strong></span>component's <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">2, 0.5, 2</code>). The result looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_09_05.jpg" /></div><p>Try it in VR. Walk inside the cylinder and look around.</p><p>Undesirably, the texture image is also mapped onto the top and bottom circle planes at either end of the cylinder. If you're interested, you can use Blender to build a proper cylinder with no faces on the ends.</p><p>However, while panoramas are fun in a "Year 2009" kind of way, the real answer is that panoramic cylinders are pretty lame for VR. Nevertheless, there may be other practical applications <a id="id527" class="indexterm"></a>of cylindrical projections in VR, especially for the display of two-dimensional quantitative information, which we will explore next<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span>
