You can unwrap a mesh (in Blender, for instance) into a flattened 2D configuration to define the mapping of texture pixels to the corresponding areas on the mesh surface (the UV coordinates). A globe of the Earth, when unwrapped, will be distorted, as defined by the unwrapped mesh. The resulting image is called a UV Texture image.</p><p>In computer graphic modeling, this UV mapping can be arbitrary and depends on the artistic requirements at hand. However, for 360-degree media, this is typically done using an <a id="id533" class="indexterm"></a>
