<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec46"></a>Locomotion, teleportation, and sensors</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>We just <a id="id372" class="indexterm"></a>implemented a simple look-based mechanism to move through a <a id="id373" class="indexterm"></a>virtual reality scene. You could of course decide to stick with<a id="id374" class="indexterm"></a> a keyboard, joystick, or a gamepad to control your character like a conventional video game. New techniques for locomotion and teleportation<a id="id375" class="indexterm"></a> control are continuously being tried. Here are some ideas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Look to walk</strong></span>: Walk in the direction of your gaze. Your feet stay on the ground, animated. This is the mechanism that we previously implemented.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The hover disc</strong></span>: Step onto a hover disc to begin moving. Step off it when you're done. This requires a way to indicate the action of stepping on and stepping off.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Segway</strong></span>: Like the hover disc but you move forward and turn by leaning into it, and slow down or stop by leaning back.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Superman fly</strong></span>: Jump to take off, fly by looking, and crouch to land. With positional hand controllers, you can stretch your hands out to your sides to glide and in front to go up or down. Also, take off by leaping over tall buildings in a single bound.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The grappling "look"</strong></span>: Stare at a location, eject a hook (or a <span class="emphasis"><em>spidey</em></span> web) on a rope, which attaches and you swing through the space.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The third-person runner</strong></span>: When you start moving quickly, the camera steps away<a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a> from the first-person view to the third-person view <a id="id377" class="indexterm"></a>while you're traveling. When you're done, it<a id="id378" class="indexterm"></a> returns to the first-person view.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pilot</strong></span>: You're<a id="id379" class="indexterm"></a> sitting in the cockpit of a vehicle, driving it with various controls.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ride on rails</strong></span>: A passive ride through the scene, such as a roller coaster or a tour bus. There are no user controls for where you're going, but you can look around.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Look-at targets</strong></span>: The scene includes targets that you can stare at, press a button, and you get teleported to the location in the scene.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Walk-through portals</strong></span>: Teleport by walking through a portal or a doorway. This is a common mechanism that is used to jump between scenes or levels.</p></li></ul></div><p>How many more can you think of? We will implement a few of these in the coming chapters.</p><p>Hardware input devices will have a big impact on how we control our first-person character. At this time, we're limited by the available hardware. For this book, I had to take the lowest common denominator of Oculus and Cardboard. So, we cannot necessarily assume any input devices, not even the humble handheld gamepad, keyboard, or mouse.</p><p>However, in the near future, this will change. We already have <span class="strong"><strong>Microsoft Kinect</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Leap Motion</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Valve Lighthouse</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Touch</strong></span>, and other technologies to experiment with. As the hand- and body-tracking input becomes more common, developers will have more options for the implementation of locomotion and teleportation mechanics in virtual reality <a id="id380" class="indexterm"></a>applications. Devices may include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gamepad</strong></span>: Here<a id="id381" class="indexterm"></a> today, a traditional gamepad controller or a keyboard (WASD) and/or a mouse input device can certainly be used in VR applications. The problem is that it's hard to see which button to press when your eyes are covered. An <span class="strong"><strong>Xbox One</strong></span> controller will ship with the Oculus Rift consumer versions.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>HMD touchpad</strong></span>: Samsung <a id="id382" class="indexterm"></a>Gear VR includes a small touchpad on the side for user input.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Positional game controller</strong></span>: A handheld controller that includes positional tracking <a id="id383" class="indexterm"></a>and motion sensors can be used to drive your character as well as use hand gestures. A few strategically placed buttons can also be effective. There's one for each hand. Examples of handheld controllers are Valve Lighthouse and Oculus Touch.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wearable motion sensors</strong></span>: In addition to your head and hands, if you're wearing <a id="id384" class="indexterm"></a>motion sensors on your torso, legs, or feet, the game can sense all kinds of body movement.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Body-tracking cameras</strong></span>: We can use infrared or other camera technology with body<a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a> recognition and tracking<a id="id386" class="indexterm"></a> software, such as<a id="id387" class="indexterm"></a> Microsoft Kinect.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Treadmills</strong></span>: VR<a id="id388" class="indexterm"></a> treadmills and related devices detect when <a id="id389" class="indexterm"></a>and where you're walking. Walk around using your feet and legs? How strange!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Voice commands</strong></span>: Speak <a id="id390" class="indexterm"></a>your mind rather than push buttons.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Gesture recognition</strong></span>: With hand recognition, gesture input vocabularies will be <a id="id391" class="indexterm"></a>established (for instance, everyone now knows about swipe and pinch on smartphones.)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Eye tracking</strong></span>: This detects <a id="id392" class="indexterm"></a>where your eyeballs are looking, and, perhaps, recognize glances and other eye gestures.</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Facial Expression Recognition</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Alpha Brain Waves</strong></span>... and the list can go on.</p><p>People <a id="id393" class="indexterm"></a>have joked about tongue-based input controllers. A presentation that was made in 1991 makes fun of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Nose Gesture Interface</em></span> (for more information, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.powershow.com/view4/44dcae-ZjBjY/A_Nose_Gesture_Interface_Device_Extending_Virtual_Realities_powerpoint_ppt_presentation" target="_blank">http://www.powershow.com/view4/44dcae-ZjBjY/A_Nose_Gesture_Interface_Device_Extending_Virtual_Realities_powerpoint_ppt_presentation</a>.)</p><p>As new input devices and recognition software emerge for the consumer market, they will accelerate the expectations of VR users and force your implementation of first-person characters to provide the most immersive VR experiences.</p></div>
