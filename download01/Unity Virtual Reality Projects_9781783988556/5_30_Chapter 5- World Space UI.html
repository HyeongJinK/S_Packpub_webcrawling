<span class="strong"><strong>Graphical user interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GUI</strong></span>) or just UI, usually refers to on-screen two-dimensional graphics, which <a id="id243" class="indexterm"></a>overlay the main gameplay and present information to the user with status messages, gauges, and input controls such as menus, buttons, sliders, and so on.</p><p>In Unity 5, UI elements always reside on a <span class="strong"><strong>canvas</strong></span>. The Unity manual quotes the <span class="strong"><strong>canvas</strong></span> component as the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The <a id="id244" class="indexterm"></a>Canvas component represents the abstract space in which the UI is laid out and rendered. All UI elements must be children of a GameObject that has a Canvas component attached.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In conventional video games, UI objects are usually rendered in a <span class="strong"><strong>screen space</strong></span> canvas as an overlay. Screen space UI is analogous to a piece of cardboard pasted on your TV or monitor, overlaying the game action behind it.</p><p>However, that doesn't work in VR. If you attempt to use screen space for UI in virtual reality, you'll run into issues. Since there are two stereographic cameras, you need separate views for each eye. While conventional games may co-opt the edges of the screen for UI, <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual reality has no screen edges!</em></span>
</p><p>Instead in VR, we use various approaches that place the user interface elements in <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> rather than screen space. In this chapter, I characterized a number of these types. We'll define these types in detail and give examples of the same throughout this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Visor heads-up display</strong></span>: In visor <span class="strong"><strong>heads-up display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>) the user interface canvas<a id="id245" class="indexterm"></a> appears at the same spot in front of your eyes regardless of the head movement</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reticle cursors</strong></span>: Similar<a id="id246" class="indexterm"></a> to visor HUD, a crosshair or a pointer cursor is used to choose things in the scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Windshield HUD</strong></span>: This <a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a>is a pop-up panel floating in 3D space like a windshield in a cockpit</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game element UI</strong></span>: The canvas is in the scene as a part of the gameplay, like a <a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a>scoreboard in a stadium</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Info bubble</strong></span>: This<a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a> is a UI message that is attached to objects in the scene, like a thought bubble hovering over a character's head</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>In-game dashboard</strong></span>: This is a control panel that is a part of the gameplay, usually<a id="id250" class="indexterm"></a> at the waist or desk height</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Responsive object UI</strong></span>: UI information need not necessarily be present in the field <a id="id251" class="indexterm"></a>of view at all times, but it is invoked in a relevant context</p></li></ul></div><p>The differences in these UI techniques basically come down to where and when you show the canvas and how the user interacts with it. In this chapter, we're going to try each of these in turn. Along the way, we'll also continue to explore user input with head movement and gestures as well as button clicks.</p><p>Note that some of the projects in this chapter use the scene completed in the previous chapter, <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gaze-based Control</em></span>, but are separate and not directly required by the other chapters in this book. If you decide to skip any of it or not save your work, that's OK.</p></div>
