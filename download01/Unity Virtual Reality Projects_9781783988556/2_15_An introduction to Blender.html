<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"></a>An introduction to Blender</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Open <a id="id110" class="indexterm"></a>the Blender application. Dismiss the opening splash screen. You will be in the Blender editor, which is similar to what's shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_12.jpg" /></div><p>Like Unity, Blender consists of a number of non-overlapping windows, and their layout can be customized to suit your needs. However, the Blender interface can be more daunting, in part because it integrates a number of different editors that can be opened at the same time, in their own panels.</p><p>It's helpful to realize that the default view, as shown in the preceding screenshot, contains five different editors!</p><p>The most obvious editor is the large <span class="strong"><strong>3D View</strong></span>, which I highlighted with a (red) rectangle. This is where you<a id="id111" class="indexterm"></a> can view, move, and organize the objects in your Blender scene.</p><p>The following are the other editors that are opened:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Info editor</strong></span>, which can be seen along the top edge of the app, has global menus <a id="id112" class="indexterm"></a>and information about the application</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Timeline editor</strong></span>, which <a id="id113" class="indexterm"></a>is present along the bottom edge of the app, is for animations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Outliner editor</strong></span>, in the upper right-hand side, has a hierarchical view of the<a id="id114" class="indexterm"></a> objects in your scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Properties editor</strong></span>, which can be seen to the right below the Outliner, is a powerful <a id="id115" class="indexterm"></a>panel that lets you see and modify many properties of the objects in the scene</p></li></ul></div><p>Each editor<a id="id116" class="indexterm"></a> can have multiple panes. Let's consider the 3D View editor:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The large area in the middle is the <span class="strong"><strong>3D Viewport</strong></span>, where you can view, move, and organize the objects in your Blender scene.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Just below the 3D Viewport is the editor <span class="strong"><strong>Header</strong></span>, which is called so although it's at the bottom in this case. The Header is a row of menus and tools that provide great control over the editor, including view selectors, edit modes, transform manipulators, and layer management.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>On the left-hand side is the <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Shelf</strong></span> containing various editing tools that can be applied to the currently selected object, which can be organized into tabbed groups. The <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Shelf</strong></span> can be toggled open or closed by grabbing and sliding its edge or by pressing the key <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The 3D Viewport also has a <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> pane, which may be hidden by default and can be toggled open or closed by pressing the key <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>. It provides the property settings for the currently selected object.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the upcoming instructions, we will ask you to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Interaction Mode</strong></span> of the 3D View editor, say between the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Mode</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Paint</strong></span> mode. This is selected in the Header, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_13.jpg" /></div><p>The other <a id="id117" class="indexterm"></a>editors also have the Header panes. The Info editor (at the top of the app) is only a Header! The Outliner and Properties editors (on the right) have their Headers at the top of their panel rather than at the bottom.</p><p>Once you recognize this layout, it doesn't look so crowded and confusing.</p><p>The Properties editor Header has a wide set of icons, which act like tabs, to select the group of properties presented in the rest of the panel. Hovering your mouse over the icon (like any of the UI widgets here) will show a tooltip with a better hint as regards what it's for. It's pictured in the following images (in a couple of pages) when we get to using it.</p><p>The Blender layout is very flexible. You can even change a panel from one editor to another. At the far left of each Header is the <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Type</strong></span> selector. When you click on it, you can see all the options.</p><p>In addition to the plethora of things that you can click on in the Blender interface, you can use just about any command using a keyboard shortcut. If you forget where to find a selection, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>space bar</em></span> and type in your best guess of the command name that you're looking for. It just might pop up!</p><p>The following is the screenshot showing the <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Type</strong></span> selector available in Blender:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_14.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec24"></a>A unit cube</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, let's <a id="id118" class="indexterm"></a>build a unit cube in Blender.</p><p>The default scene may already have objects, including a cube, camera, and a light source, as shown earlier in the default Blender window. (Your start up settings may be different, since that can be configured).</p><p>If your startup scene does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> contain a unit cube, create one, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Make sure that the scene is empty by deleting whatever is there in it (right-click to select, <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> key on the keyboard to delete).</p></li><li><p>Set the 3D cursor to the origin (0,0,0) using <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> (opens the <span class="strong"><strong>Snap</strong></span> options list) | <span class="strong"><strong>Cursor To Center</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In the left <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Shelf</strong></span> panel, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> tab and under <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh</strong></span> select <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> to add a cube.</p></li></ol></div><p>OK, now<a id="id119" class="indexterm"></a> we're all on the same page.</p><p>Note that in Blender, the reference grid extends in the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axes, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> is up (unlike Unity, where the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis is up).</p><p>Furthermore, note that the default cube in Blender has the size of (2, 2, 2). We want a unit cube sitting on the ground plane at the origin. For this, follow the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the Properties pane with the keyboard <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> key.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> and set <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>).</p></li><li><p>Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Location</strong></span> and set <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.5</code>.</p></li><li><p>Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> key again to hide the pane.</p></li><li><p>You can zoom in using the scroll-wheel of the mouse.</p></li></ol></div><p>For our purposes, also ensure that the current renderer is <span class="strong"><strong>Blender Render</strong></span> (on the drop-down selector on the Info editor at the top of the app window in the center).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec25"></a>A UV Texture image</h3></div></div></div><p>Next, we <a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a>will create a <span class="strong"><strong>UV Texture image</strong></span>, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Go into <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Mode</strong></span> using the <span class="strong"><strong>Interaction Mode</strong></span> selector in the bottom Header bar.</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> ( press the <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> key on keyboard twice) to make sure that all the faces are selected.</p></li><li><p>In the left <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Shelf</strong></span> panel, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Shading/UVs</strong></span> tab.</p></li><li><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>UV Mapping</strong></span> click on <span class="strong"><strong>Unwrap</strong></span>, select <span class="strong"><strong>Smart UV Project</strong></span> from the drop-down list, accept the default values, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> (the result, shown in the following screenshot, also shows what the unwrapped cube looks like).</p></li><li><p>Now, go into the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Paint</strong></span> mode using the <span class="strong"><strong>Interaction Mode</strong></span> selector in the bottom Header bar again.</p></li><li><p>We need to define a <span class="emphasis"><em>paint slot</em></span> for our material. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Paint Slot</strong></span>, select <span class="strong"><strong>Diffuse Color</strong></span>, name it <code class="literal">CubeFaces</code>, and press <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>We can now start painting directly on the cube. Paint the front face first, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Make a smaller brush. In the left <span class="strong"><strong>Tool Shelf</strong></span> panel, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Tools</strong></span> tab, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Brush</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span> and enter <code class="literal">8 px</code>.</p></li><li><p>It may be easier to work in an orthographic view. From the menu bar at the bottom, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>View Persp/Ortho</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Then, navigate<a id="id121" class="indexterm"></a> to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Front</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>You can zoom in or out using the mouse scroll-wheel, if needed.</p></li><li><p>With your best handwriting, write the word <code class="literal">Front</code> using the left-click of the mouse and draw.</p></li><li><p>Now, we'll do the same for the back face.</p></li><li><p>From the menu bar at the bottom, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Back</strong></span> and select this face with a right-click.</p></li><li><p>With your best handwriting, write <code class="literal">Back</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Repeat the above process for the left, right, top, and bottom faces. If at some point it's not painting, make sure that there's a current face selected. Try right-clicking on the face to reselect it. The result should look something like this (shown side-by-side both in the <span class="strong"><strong>3D View</strong></span> editor with an orthographic perspective and the <span class="strong"><strong>UV/Image Editor</strong></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_15.jpg" /></div><p>Now, we need to save the texture image and set up its properties, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Change the current <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>UV/Image Editor</strong></span> using the selector on the far left of the Header at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>3D View</strong></span> editor.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Browse Image to be linked</strong></span> selector icon (just towards the left of <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> icon) and choose <code class="literal">CubeFaces</code> from the list.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span>
<a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a> menu item on the menu bar at the bottom now has an asterisk (<span class="strong"><strong>Image*</strong></span>) indicating that there's an unsaved image. Click on it, select <span class="strong"><strong>Save As Image</strong></span>, and save it as <code class="literal">CubeFaces.png</code>. Use a folder outside the Unity project.</p></li><li><p>On the right-hand side, in the Properties editor panel, find the long row of icons in its Header and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> one (third from the last). It may be hidden if the panel isn't wide enough; you can scroll down with your mouse to show it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_16.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Within the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> properties, change <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Image or Movie</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Then, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> group of properties, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Browse Image to be Linked</strong></span> selector icon (as shown in the following screenshot) and choose <code class="literal">CubeFaces</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_17.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You should see the labeled faces texture image in the <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> window.</p></li></ol></div><p>Good! Let's save the Blender model, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> from the top main menu bar in the Info editor and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> (or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>).</p></li><li><p>Use the same folder as the one where you saved the texture image.</p></li><li><p>Name it <code class="literal">UprightCube.blend</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save Blender File</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>We <a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>should now have two files in a folder, <code class="literal">UprightCube.blend</code> and <code class="literal">CubeFaces.png</code>. I use a folder named <code class="literal">Blender/</code> in the root of my Unity project. Note that alternatively, you can export to other standard formats, such as <span class="strong"><strong>FBX</strong></span> (short for <span class="strong"><strong>Filmbox</strong></span>).</p><p>Wow, that <a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a>was a lot. Don't worry if you didn't get it all. Blender can be daunting. However, Unity needs models. You can always download someone else's models from the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> and other 3D model sharing sites. Don't be a wimp, learn to make your own. Ha ha! Seriously, it's a good thing to start to learn.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Importing into Unity</h3></div></div></div><p>Back in<a id="id125" class="indexterm"></a> Unity, we now want to import both the files, <code class="literal">UprightCube.blend</code> and <code class="literal">CubeFaces.png</code>, one at a time, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, select the top-level <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span>, and rename the folder to <code class="literal">Models</code>.</p></li><li><p>An easy way to import files into Unity is to just drag and drop the <code class="literal">.blend</code> file from the Windows Explorer (or Mac Finder) window into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel <span class="strong"><strong>Assets/Models</strong></span> folder and drag and drop the <code class="literal">.png</code> file into the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets/Textures</strong></span> folder (or you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset...</strong></span> from the main menu bar).</p></li><li><p>Add <code class="literal">UprightCube</code> to the scene by dragging it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets/Models</strong></span> folder where it was just imported into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.</p></li><li><p>Set its position so that it's away from the other objects.

Is that a mistake? Actually, it makes sense since the current viewpoint is looking forward. So we should see the back of the cube. If you didn't notice already, the same goes for Ethan. It also seems like the cube has a one-unit dimension.</p><p>However, on closer examination, in the cube's <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, you'll see it imported with the scale that we gave it in Blender—(0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Also, it has an X-rotation of <code class="literal">-90</code> (minus 90). Thus, if we reset the transform, that is, the scale to (1,1,1), it'll be 2 units in our world space and tipped over (so, don't reset it).</p><p>There's not much that we can do to compensate for the rotational adjustment without going back to Blender.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"></a>Note</h3><p>Blender's default up direction is <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>, while Unity's is <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>. Importing with a -90 X-rotation adjusts for that. An imported scale can be adjusted in the object's <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel's <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span>.</p></div><p>The scaling issue can be fixed with further tweaking, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, select <code class="literal">UprightCube</code> that we imported. The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel shows its <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Change <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Factor</strong></span> from <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.5</code>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><p>The cube in the scene can now have <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> (1, 1, 1) and be a unit cube, like we'd expected.</p></li><li><p>With <code class="literal">UprightCube</code> selected in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, change its <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">1</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>).</p></li></ol></div><p>Before<a id="id127" class="indexterm"></a> ending the preceding process, select <code class="literal">UprightCube</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and drag it into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel's <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder. (You may consider making an <span class="strong"><strong>Assets/Prefabs</strong></span> subfolder and placing it into that). This makes it a reusable prefab, texture image and all.</p><p>There are some important lessons in this exercise (other than having learned a little bit of Blender) that apply to any 3D Unity project, including the VR ones. Normally, you will be importing models that are much more complex than a cube. You will likely run into issues related to data conversion, scale, orientation, and UV texture images that might be confusing at best. If this happens, try to break the problem into smaller, more isolated scenarios. Do little tests to gain insight on how applications exchange data and help you understand which parameter tweaks might be necessary.</p></div></div>
