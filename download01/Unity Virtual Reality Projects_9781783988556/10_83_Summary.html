We built a simple scene and an avatar, keeping in mind that the intent was to allow the avatar's head movement to be synchronized with the player's head-mounted display.</p><p>We then converted the scene to multiplayer, adding the Unity Network components, which simplified the multiplayer implementation to just a handful of clicks.</p><p>Next, we added virtual reality to the multiplayer experience, first by using Unity's built-in support for the Oculus Rift and then by adding Google Cardboard support for Android.</p><p>Finally, I showed you how easy it is to create a virtual room in the VRChat metaverse by exporting a scene that you can share almost instantly.</p></div>
