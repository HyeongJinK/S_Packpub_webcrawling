Along the way, we learned about positioning and transforming objects in Unity's 3D world space. The problem is that the actual size of stuff in your scene is not always obvious. You could be zoomed up or you may be using either a <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> versus <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> view, or other features that affect the apparent size. Let's look at ways to deal with the scale.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>Keeping a unit cube handy</h3></div></div></div><p>I suggest <a id="id102" class="indexterm"></a>keeping a unit cube handy in your <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. When it's not needed, just disable it (uncheck the checkbox in the top left-hand side of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel). It can be used like a measuring stick or rather a measuring block, when needed. I use one to estimate actual world sizes of objects, distances between objects, heights and elevations, and so forth. Let's do it now.</p><p>Create a unit cube, name it <code class="literal">Unit Cube</code>, place it somewhere out of the way for now, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> (<code class="literal">-2</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">-2</code>).</p><p>You can also add a tick-marked tape measure texture to its edges.</p><p>Leave it enabled for the time being.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"></a>Using a Grid Projector</h3></div></div></div><p>I want to <a id="id103" class="indexterm"></a>tell you about the <span class="strong"><strong>Grid Projector</strong></span>, a handy tool that is used to visualize a scale in any Unity scene. It's one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> package. So, you may need to import it into your project. To import, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> in the main menu bar and then navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> dialog box pops up, containing the list of all the things that can get imported. If you want, just click on <span class="strong"><strong>All</strong></span> and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>. However, we only really need the <span class="strong"><strong>Projectors</strong></span> folder so that you can choose and import just that folder.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, we'll add a Projector to the scene, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Find the Grid Projector prefab located in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, navigating to the <code class="literal">Assets/Standard Assets/Effects/Projectors/Prefabs</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Drag a copy of Grid Projector into your scene. Set its <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to <code class="literal">5</code> so that it's above the ground plane.</p></li></ol></div><p>The default Grid Projector is facing downward (<span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> = <code class="literal">90</code>), which is usually what <a id="id104" class="indexterm"></a>we want. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, you can see the Orthographic projection rays. A Unity doc (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Projector.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Projector.html</a>) explains a Projector as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A Projector allows you to project a Material onto all objects that intersect its frustum.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>This means that the objects intersected by the projection rays will receive the projected material.</p><p>In this case, as you'd expect, the Projector material (also named <code class="literal">GridProjector</code>) has a "Grid" texture, which simply looks like a crosshair (see for yourself, in the <code class="literal">Assets/â€¦/Projectors/Textures/Grid</code> object).</p><p>By default, the Projector shines the grid pattern as a light on the surface that it illuminates. In our scene, the <code class="literal">GroundPlane</code> plane is light. So the grid may not show up. Now follow the following steps:</p><p>With Grid Projector selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, locate the <code class="literal">GridProjector</code> Material component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel and change its <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> from <span class="strong"><strong>Hidden/Projector Light</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Hidden/Projector Multiply</strong></span>.</p><p>It now paints white gridlines on black. To get a better feel of what's going on, change the scene view to a <span class="strong"><strong>Top</strong></span> view orientation, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click the green <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> cone on the Scene view gizmo in the upper right-hand side of the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>Also, click the little cube at the center of the gizmo to change from the <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> to the <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> (non-distortion) view.</p></li></ol></div><p>You should now be looking straight down onto the ground plane. With the Grid Projector selected (make sure that the Translate tool is active, which is the second icon in the top left icon toolbar), you can grab the Translate gizmo attached to the Projector and move it from side-to-side. The grid line will move accordingly. You might leave it at <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> (<code class="literal">-2.5</code>, <code class="literal">5</code>, <code class="literal">-0.5</code>) and avoid the projector blocking the directional light.</p><p>At this <a id="id105" class="indexterm"></a>point, the built-in view reference grid might be confusing. So, turn it off in the following way:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view panel, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Gizmos</strong></span> (the menu with this name, which has options to control your gizmos) and uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>Show Grid</strong></span>.</p><p>OK, so what does this get us? We can see that the default grid size measures half the edge of the unit cube. In <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, the Projector component's <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> size value is 0.25.</p></li><li><p>Change the Projector's <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> Size value from 0.25 to <code class="literal">0.5</code>.</p></li><li><p>Save the scene and the project.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, we have a 1-unit grid that can be turned on and projected onto the scene any time it is needed.</p><p>Let's leave it on for now because it looks kind of cool, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_10.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec23"></a>Measuring the Ethan character</h3></div></div></div><p>How<a id="id106" class="indexterm"></a> big is an avatar? Unity comes with a third-person character named <code class="literal">Ethan</code>. Let's add him to our scene. He's one of the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span> package. So, you may need to import that into your project.</p><p>To import, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> in the main menu bar and then navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> dialog box pops up, containing the list of all the things that can get imported. Click <span class="strong"><strong>All</strong></span> and then <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>ThirdPersonController</strong></span> is a prefab (pre-built asset) located in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. This can be found by navigating to the <code class="literal">Assets/Standard Assets/Characters/ThirdPersonCharacter/Prefabs</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Drag a copy of <span class="strong"><strong>ThirdPersonController</strong></span> into your scene. The exact X and Z positions don't matter, but set the Y to 0 so that the character named <code class="literal">Ethan</code> is standing on <code class="literal">GroundPlane</code>. I left mine at (2.2, 0, 0.75).</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's try it out:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Play</em></span> icon at the top of the Unity window in the center, to start your game. Use the <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> keys to move him around. <span class="emphasis"><em>Run, Ethan! Run!</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Play</em></span> icon again to stop the game and return to the edit mode.</p></li></ol></div><p>So, how big is Ethan? According to Google search, the average height of a human male is 5' 6" or 1.68 meters (in USA, the average adult male is more like 5' 10" or 1.77 meters tall). Let's see how tall Ethan is when compared to these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Slide the unit cube next to Ethan using the Translate gizmo</p><p>Alright, he's about 1.6 times its height</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scale the unit cube's height (<span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>) to <code class="literal">1.6</code> and adjust its Y position to <code class="literal">0.8</code>
</p></li></ul></div><p>Look again. As illustrated in the following screenshot, he's not quite 1.6. So Ethan is a little shorter than the average male (unless you include his pointy hairdo). Swinging my view around, I'm looking at Ethan right in the face, and by further adjusting the cube the eye level is about 1.4 meters. Make a note of this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Restore the unit cube's <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> (<code class="literal">1</code>,<code class="literal">1</code>,<code class="literal">1</code>) and <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> (<code class="literal">-2</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">-2</code>).</p></li><li><p>Save the scene and the project.</p></li></ol></div><p>The following screenshot shows the comparison of a cube 1.6 units tall and Ethan:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/4781_02_11.jpg" /></div></div></div>
