We started by dissecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span> prefabs under Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> and the components that they use, including Camera, Character Controller, and/or Rigidbody.</p><p>Then, we developed our own first-person character, starting with the static positioned VR camera rig that we used for our <code class="literal">Diorama</code> scene. We incrementally added features to move in the direction of your gaze, gravity, solid-object collisions, and use head gestures to start and stop walking. We made adjustments for camera height and explored the relationship between a first-person head versus a body in virtual reality. Lastly, we reviewed some of the factors that VR developers should think about to provide a comfortable VR experience and avoid motion sickness.</p><p>It is not my intent to say that you should always build your own first-person controllers instead of using the prefabs provided by Unity or VR integration packages. However, you certainly might need to take one of them apart and customize it. After this chapter, you should have a better idea of what this might entail.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Physics and the Environment</em></span>, we'll explore uses of Rigidbody, the Unity physics engine, and physic materials, plus a bit of 3D modeling using Blender.</p></div>
