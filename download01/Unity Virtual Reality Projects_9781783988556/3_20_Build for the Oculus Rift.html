To develop for the Rift, you'll want to be sure that the Rift runs fine on the same machine on which you're using Unity.</p><p>Unity has built-in support for the Oculus Rift. You just need to configure your <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings...</strong></span>, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>From main menu bar, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings...</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>If the current scene is not listed under <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Choose <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac, &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> list on the left and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Choose your <span class="strong"><strong>Target Platform OS</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Select</strong></span> list on the right (for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span>).</p></li><li><p>Then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings...</strong></span> and go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>Other Settings</strong></span>, check off the <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality Supported</strong></span> checkbox and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> if the <span class="strong"><strong>Changing editor vr device</strong></span> dialog box pops up.</p></li></ol></div><p>To test it <a id="id155" class="indexterm"></a>out, make sure that the Rift is properly connected and turned on. Click on the game <span class="emphasis"><em>Play</em></span> button at the top of the application in the center. Put on the headset, and IT SHOULD BE AWESOME! Within the Rift, you can look all around—left, right, up, down, and behind you. You can lean over and lean in. Using the keyboard, you can make Ethan walk, run, and jump just like we did earlier.</p><p>Now, you can build your game as a separate executable app using the following steps. Most likely, you've done this before, at least for non-VR apps. It's pretty much the same:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>From the main menu bar, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings...</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> and set its name.</p></li><li><p>I like to keep my builds in a subdirectory named <code class="literal">Builds</code>; create one if you want to.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>An executable will be created in your <code class="literal">Builds</code> folder. If you're on Windows, there may also be a <code class="literal">rift_Data</code> folder with built data. Run <code class="literal">Diorama</code> as you would do for any executable application—double-click on it. Choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Windowed</strong></span> checkbox option so that when you're ready to quit, close the window with the standard <span class="emphasis"><em>Close</em></span> icon in the upper right of your screen.</p></div>
