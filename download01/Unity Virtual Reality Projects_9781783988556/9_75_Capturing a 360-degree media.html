When viewed in VR, yes, there are left and right eyes, but this is a stereo view of the same flat image that was projected onto a sphere. It doesn't provide any real parallax or illusion of depth through occlusion. You can rotate your head, but you should not move its position from the center of the sphere. Otherwise, the immersive illusion may be broken.</p><p>What about true 360-degree stereo? What if each eye has its own photo sphere offset from the other eye's position? Stereoscopic 360-degree recording and playback is a very difficult problem.</p><p>To capture non-stereo 360-degree media, you can use a rig such as GoPro Kolor, pictured in the following image on the left. It records all six directions at once with six separate GoPro cameras. The synchronized videos are then stitched together with special, advanced imaging software, much like the Photo Sphere app mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, but for videos.</p><p>To capture stereo 360-degree media, you'd need a rig such as Google Jump, which arranges 16 separate GoPro cameras in a cylindrical array, pictured at the center of the following image. Advanced image processing software then constructs stereographic views using batch cloud processing power that may take hours to complete.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>For a<a id="id551" class="indexterm"></a> more detailed explanation of how rigs such as the Google Jump 16-camera array work, read the article, <span class="emphasis"><em>Stereographic 3D Panoramic Images</em></span>, by Paul Bourke (May, 2002) by visiting <a class="ulink" href="http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereopanoramic/" target="_blank">http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereopanoramic/</a>.</p></div><p>To capture fully immersive 360-degree media, new technologies such as the JauntVR NEO light field camera, pictured in the following image, on the right-hand side, are being invented from the ground up, specifically for cinematic VR content:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_09_13.jpg" /></div><p>Time <a id="id552" class="indexterm"></a>will tell how these media technologies will develop and become a part of our creative toolbox.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"></a>Note</h3><p>
