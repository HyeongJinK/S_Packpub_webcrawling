This is just the beginning for all of us. We are pioneers, and you have an opportunity to help invent the future.</p><p>I have a few more parting thoughts that are more philosophical than you might expect in a technical book like this.</p><p>Humans are especially good at navigating 3D spaces and remembering where they've been. Having visited a place in person, you're much more likely to retain its memory than if you were just told about it. There are proven memorization techniques, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>memory palace</em></span>, where you remember names at a dinner party or lines of Shakespeare by building an imaginary castle in your mind with hallways and rooms representing places to "store" things. It works because it draws upon our innate abilities to remember spaces.</p><p>With this instinctive<a id="id619" class="indexterm"></a> spatial memory, we form cognitive maps that help us solve problems, which might otherwise prove too abstract or complex. Such capacities have been attributed not only to physical navigation, but also to engineering, mathematics, music, literature, visual thinking, science, social models, and, in fact, most areas of human endeavor. We engage <span class="emphasis"><em>mental models</em></span> to gain critical understanding of the problems at hand.</p><p>One reason behind why virtual reality is compelling is because it exploits our inherent capacity to experience and use three-dimensional spaces without being limited to the physical world. Applications of VR offer the promise of enhancing human memory and intelligence.</p><p>Photorealism is not necessarily required. It's now recognized that <span class="emphasis"><em>almost-real</em></span> is often worse than <a id="id620" class="indexterm"></a>cartoons in what's called the <span class="strong"><strong>uncanny valley</strong></span>, where we experience virtuality, especially humanoid characters, as creepy and unnatural (for more <a id="id621" class="indexterm"></a>information, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley</a>). Realism can be good up to a point, but sometimes, abstraction or cartooning is more effective. Keep this in mind when designing your own VR experiences.</p><p>Still, many people are drawn to virtual reality with the expectation or at least the eventual promise of have realistic real-life experiences in cyberspace. I think that this is a mistake. Do not assume that for VR to succeed, we must experience a full sensory simulation of life-like virtual environments. Are you going to just jack yourself into the metaverse with feeding tubes, like <span class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Ready Player One</em></span>?</p><p>More likely, as VR goes mainstream, it will develop into its own medium for expression, communications, education, problem solving, and storytelling. Your grandparents needed to learn to type and read. Your parents needed to learn PowerPoint and browse the web. Your children will build castles and teleport between virtual spaces. VR will not replace the real world and our humanity; it will enhance it.</p></div>
