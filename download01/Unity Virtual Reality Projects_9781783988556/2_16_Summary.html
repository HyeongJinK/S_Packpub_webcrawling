We also set up several in-game tools to help us work with scaling and positioning in the future chapters. Lastly, we jumped into Blender, built a model with a UV texture, and learned some of the issues that can arise when importing these models into Unity.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll set up a project with a virtual reality camera and build and run the project in your VR headset.</p></div>
