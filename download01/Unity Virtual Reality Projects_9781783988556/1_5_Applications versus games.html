Video<a id="id30" class="indexterm"></a> gamers are already accustomed to being engaged in highly interactive hyper-realistic 3D environments. VR just ups the ante.</p><p>Gamers are early adopters of high-end graphics technology. Mass production of gaming consoles and PC-based components in the tens of millions and competition between vendors leads to lower prices and higher performance. Game developers follow suit, often pushing the state-of-the-art, squeezing every ounce of performance out of hardware and software. Gamers are a very demanding bunch, and the market has consistently stepped up to keep them satisfied. It's no surprise that many, if not most, of the current wave of the VR hardware and software companies are first targeting the video gaming industry. A<a id="id31" class="indexterm"></a> majority of the demos and downloads that are available<a id="id32" class="indexterm"></a> on <span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Share</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://share.oculus.com/" target="_blank">https://share.oculus.com/</a>) and <span class="strong"><strong>Google Play</strong></span> for the Cardboard app (<a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=cardboard&amp;c=apps" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/search?q=cardboard&amp;c=apps</a>) are games. Gamers are the most enthusiastic VR advocates and seriously appreciate its potential.</p><p>Game developers know that the core of a game is the <span class="strong"><strong>game mechanics</strong></span>, or the rules, which are largely independent of the <span class="emphasis"><em>skin</em></span>, or the thematic topic of the game. Gameplay mechanics can include puzzles, chance, strategy, timing, or muscle memory (<span class="emphasis"><em>twitch</em></span>). VR games <a id="id33" class="indexterm"></a>can have the same mechanic elements but might need<a id="id34" class="indexterm"></a> to be adjusted for the virtual environment. For example, a <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>first-person character walking in a console video game is probably going about 1.5 times faster than their actual pace in real life. If this wasn't the case, the player would feel that the game is too slow and boring. Put the same character in a VR scene and they will feel that it is too fast; it could likely make the player feel nauseous. In VR, you will want your characters to walk a normal, earthly pace. Not all video games will map well to VR; it may not be fun to be in the middle of a war zone when you're actually there.</p><p>That said, virtual reality is also being applied in areas other than gaming. Though games will remain important, non-gaming apps will eventually overshadow them. These applications may differ from games in a number of ways, with the most significant having much less emphasis on game mechanics and more emphasis on either the experience itself or application-specific goals. Of course, this doesn't preclude some game mechanics. For example, the application may be specifically designed to train the user at a specific skill. Sometimes, the <span class="strong"><strong>gamification</strong></span> of a business or personal application makes it more fun and effective in driving the desired behavior through competition. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Note</h3><p>In general, non-gaming VR applications are less about winning and more about the experience itself.</p></div><p>Here are a<a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a> few examples of the kinds of non-gaming applications that people are working on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Travel and tourism</strong></span>: Visit faraway places without leaving your home. Visit art museums in Paris, New York, and Tokyo in one afternoon. Take a walk on Mars. You can even enjoy Holi, the spring festival of colors, in India while sitting in your wintery cabin in Vermont.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mechanical engineering and industrial design</strong></span>: Computer-aided design software such as AutoCAD and SOLIDWORKS pioneered three-dimensional modeling, simulation, and visualization. With VR, engineers and designers can directly experience the hands-on end product before it's actually built and play with what-if scenarios at a very low cost. Consider iterating <a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a>a new automobile design. How does it look? How does it perform? How does it appear sitting in the driver's seat?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Architecture and civil engineering</strong></span>: Architects and engineers have always constructed scale models of their designs, if only to pitch the ideas to clients and investors, or more importantly, to validate the many assumptions about the design. Presently, modeling and rendering software is commonly used to build virtual models from architectural plans. With VR, the conversation with<a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a> stakeholders can be so much more confident. Other <a id="id39" class="indexterm"></a>personnel, such as the interior designers, HVAC, and electrical engineers, can be brought into the process sooner.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Real estate</strong></span>: Real estate agents have been quick adopters of the Internet and visualization technology to attract buyers and close sales. Real estate search websites were some of the first successful uses of the Web. Online panoramic video walk-throughs of for-sale properties are commonplace today. With VR, I can be in New York and find a place to live in Los Angeles. This<a id="id40" class="indexterm"></a> will become even easier with mobile 3D-sensing technologies such as <span class="strong"><strong>Google Project Tango</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango</a>), which performs a 3D scan of a room using a smartphone and automatically builds a model of the space.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Medicine</strong></span>: The potential of VR for health and medicine may literally be a matter of life and death. Every day, hospitals use MRI and other scanning devices to produce models of our bones and organs that are used for medical diagnosis and possibly pre-operative planning. Using VR to enhance visualization and measurement will provide a more intuitive analysis. Virtual reality is also being used for the simulation of surgery to train medical students.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mental health</strong></span>: Virtual reality experiences have been shown to be effective in a therapeutic context for the treatment of <span class="strong"><strong>post traumatic stress disorder</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PTSD</strong></span>) in <a id="id41" class="indexterm"></a>what's called <span class="strong"><strong>exposure therapy</strong></span>, where the patient, guided by a trained therapist, confronts their traumatic memories through the retelling of the experience. Similarly, VR is being used to treat arachnophobia (spiders) and the fear of flying.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Education</strong></span>: The educational opportunities for VR are almost too obvious to mention. One <a id="id42" class="indexterm"></a>of the first successful VR experiences is <span class="strong"><strong>Titans of Space</strong></span>, which lets you explore the solar system first hand. Science, history, arts, and mathematicsâ€”VR will help students of all ages because, as they say, field trips are much more effective than textbooks.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Training</strong></span>: Toyota has demonstrated a VR simulation of drivers' education to teach teenagers about the risks of distracted driving. In another project, vocational <a id="id43" class="indexterm"></a>students got to experience the operating of cranes and other heavy construction equipment. Training for first responders, police, and the fire and rescue workers can be enhanced with VR by presenting highly risky situations and alternative virtual scenarios. The NFL is looking to VR for athletic training.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Entertainment and journalism</strong></span>: Virtually attend rock concerts and sporting events. Watch music videos. Erotica. Re-experience news events as if you were personally present. Enjoy 360-degree cinematic experiences. The art of storytelling will be transformed by virtual reality.</p></li></ul></div><p>Wow, that's quite a list! This is just the low-hanging fruit.</p><p>The <a id="id44" class="indexterm"></a>purpose of this book is not to dive too deeply into any of<a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a> these applications. Rather, I hope that this survey helps stimulate your thinking and provides a perspective towards how virtual reality has the potential to be virtually anything for everyone.</p></div>
