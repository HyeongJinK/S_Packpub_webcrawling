The computer may be a Windows PC, Mac, Linux, or a game console. Most likely, the headset is connected to the computer with wires. The game runs on the remote machine and the <span class="strong"><strong>head-mounted display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HMD</strong></span>) is a peripheral display <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>device with a motion sensing input. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>desktop</em></span> is an unfortunate misnomer since it's just <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>as likely to be stationed in either a living room or a <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>den.</p><p>The <a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Rift</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.oculus.com/" target="_blank">https://www.oculus.com/</a>) is an example of a device where the goggles have an integrated display and sensors. The games run on a separate PC. Other <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>desktop headsets include <span class="strong"><strong>HTC/Valve Vive</strong></span> and Sony's <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>project <span class="strong"><strong>Morpheus</strong></span> for PlayStation.</p><p>The Oculus Rift is tethered to a desktop computer via video and USB cables, and generally, the more <span class="strong"><strong>graphics processing unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPU</strong></span>) power, the better. However, for the purpose<a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a> of this book, we won't have any heavy rendering in our projects, and you can get by even with a laptop (provided it has two USB ports and one HDMI port available).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Mobile VR</h3></div></div></div><p>Mobile VR, exemplified by <span class="strong"><strong>Google Cardboard</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/</a>), is a simple housing (device) for two lenses and<a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a> a slot for your mobile phone. The phone's display<a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a> is used to show the twin stereographic views. It has <a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a>rotational head tracking, but it has no positional tracking. Cardboard also provides the user with the ability to click or <span class="emphasis"><em>tap</em></span> its side to make selections in a game. The complexity of the imagery is limited because it uses your phone's <a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a>processor for rendering the views on the phone display screen. Other mobile <a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a>VR headsets include Samsung <span class="strong"><strong>Gear VR</strong></span> and Zeiss <span class="strong"><strong>VR One</strong></span>, among others.</p><p>Google provides the open source specifications, and other manufacturers have developed ready-made models for purchase, with prices for the same as low as $15. If you want to find one, just Google it! There are versions of Cardboard-compatible headsets that are available for all sizes of phones—both Android and iOS.</p><p>Although the quality of the VR experience with a Cardboard device is limited (some even say that it is inadequate) and it's probably a "starter" device that will just be <span class="emphasis"><em>quaint</em></span> in a couple of years, Cardboard is fine for the small projects in this book, and we'll revisit its limitations from time to time.</p></div></div>
