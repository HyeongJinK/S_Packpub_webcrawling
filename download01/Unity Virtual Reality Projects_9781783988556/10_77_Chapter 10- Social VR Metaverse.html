I had built a seasonally-themed world named GingerLand and invited my chat room friends to visit during one of the weekly meetups. Then, someone suggested, "Hey, let's take a group picture!"

It's very personal and alive. If you've tried it out yourself, you know exactly what I mean. We're now going to look at how social VR experiences can be implemented using Unity. There are many approaches, from building it from scratch to plugging into an existing VR world. In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An introduction to how multiplayer networking works</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing a multiplayer scene that runs in VR using the Unity networking engine</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building and sharing a custom VRChat room</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the projects in this chapter are separate and not directly required by the other chapters in this book.
