Setting up is not necessarily the smoothest process, but there are plenty of us early adopters doing it, so you can get help on the Internet if you get stuck. We also discussed what happens inside the hardware and software SDK that makes virtual reality work and how it matters to us VR developers.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll work more on the <code class="literal">Diorama</code> scene and explore techniques to control objects in virtual reality. From a third-person perspective, we'll interact with objects in the scene (Ethan, the zombie) and implement look-based control.</p></div>
