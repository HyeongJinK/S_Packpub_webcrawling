The scene is a photo gallery, where you design a simple floor plan and use Blender to extrude it vertically into the walls. Use your own photos. Then, we will take a simple tour of it. At the end, we'll have a technical conversation about optimization, performance, and comfort.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using Blender and Unity to build a simplistic art gallery</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating an animated walkthrough of the gallery scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Techniques that can be used to squeeze performance from complex scenes</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the projects in this chapter are separate and not directly required by the other chapters in this book. If you decide to skip any of it or not save your work, that's OK.</p></div>
