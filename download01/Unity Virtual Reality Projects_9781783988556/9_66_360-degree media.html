Consumers may be led to believe that it's all the same thing, it's all figured out, and it's all very easy to produce, when in fact, it is not so simple.</p><p>Generally, the "360-degree" term refers to the viewing of prerecorded photos or videos in a manner that allows you to rotate your view's direction to reveal content that was just outside your field of view.</p><p>Non-VR 360-degree media has become relatively common. For example, many real-estate listing sites provide panoramic walkthroughs with a web-based player that lets you interactively pan around to view the space. Similarly, YouTube supports the uploading and playback of 360-degree videos and provides a player with interactive controls to look around <a id="id515" class="indexterm"></a>during the playback. Google Maps lets you upload 360-degree still <span class="strong"><strong>photosphere</strong></span> images, much like their Street View tool, that you can create with an Android or iOS app or a consumer camera (for more information, visit <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/</a>). The Internet is teaming with 360-degree media!</p><p>With a VR headset, viewing 360-degree media is surprisingly immersive, even just for still photos. You're standing at the center of a sphere with an image projected onto the inside surface, but you feel like you're really there in the captured scene. Simply turn your head to look around. It's one of those things that gets people interested in VR the first time they see it, and it is a popular application for Google Cardboard and GearVR.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore a variety of uses of media that take advantage of Unity and VR's ability to use all 360 degrees.</p></div>
