Then, we inverted it with a custom shader, mapping the image inside the sphere. We explored cylindrical projections of panoramas and large infographics. Then, we took several sections to understand equirectangular spherical projections and photospheres and how they're used for 360-degree immersive media in virtual reality. Lastly, we explored some of the technology behind viewing and capturing 360-degree media.</p><p>In the next chapter, we go social as we look at ways to add multi-user networking to Unity VR projects and how to add scenes to the emerging metaverse. Multiplayer games are familiar to most of us, but when combined with virtual reality, this provides a social experience that is unparalleled by any other technology. We will learn about networking technology and the new Unity Networking features that were introduced in Unity 5.1.</p></div>
