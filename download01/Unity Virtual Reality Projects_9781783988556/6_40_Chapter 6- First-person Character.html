This was intentional.</p><p>The typical approach when one starts to build a VR application is to immediately place the user directly into the scene as a first-person character. After all, wearing a VR headset is inherently a first-person point of view. However, virtual reality does not always need to be from a first-person perspective. Watching and controlling the action from a third-person point of view, such as a diorama with live actors, is a legitimate approach. In fact, some research indicates that fast-paced action games, which can unavoidably cause motion sickness when played in VR from a first-person point of view, may benefit from a third-person perspective instead.</p><p>That said, in this chapter, we will now move ourselves into a controllable first-person character and explore techniques to move around the virtual world.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Unity's character objects and components</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Controlling navigation with buttons and/or head movement</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Calibrating your avatar</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Separating your head from your body</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Exploring techniques to maintain a sense of self in VR</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The issues around VR motion sickness</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that the projects in this chapter are separate and not directly required by the other chapters in this book.
