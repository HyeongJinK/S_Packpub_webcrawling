This chapter will focus more on the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis, as we explore adding physics to the virtual experience. You will see how properties and materials based on physics can be added to objects, as well as how one can transfer physical forces between objects using the C# scripting.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Unity physics engine, the Unity Rigidbody component, and physic materials</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Transferring physical forces from one object to another with scripting</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing velocity and gravity on first-person characters</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Interacting with the environment, including headshots and jump gestures</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building models in Blender</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the projects in this chapter are separate and are not directly required by the other chapters in this book.
