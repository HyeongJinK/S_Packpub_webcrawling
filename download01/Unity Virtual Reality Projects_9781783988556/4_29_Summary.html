We first made Ethan (the zombie) walk randomly around the scene and enabled to move by using a NavMesh, but then, we directed his wanderings using a 3D cursor on the X, Z ground plane. This cursor follows our gaze as we look around the scene in virtual reality. Lastly, we also used our gaze to shoot a ray at Ethan, causing him to lose health and eventually explode.</p><p>These look-based techniques can be used in non-VR games, but in VR, it's very common and almost essential. We'll be using them more in the later chapters of this book too.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at the various ways to present the user with information and input widgets in VR. <span class="strong"><strong>User interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span>) conventions found in desktop applications and video games may not work well in VR, because they operate in <span class="emphasis"><em>Screen Space</em></span>. However, as we'll see, there are numerous other effective ways that you can use to approach UI that do make sense in virtual worlds.</p></div>
