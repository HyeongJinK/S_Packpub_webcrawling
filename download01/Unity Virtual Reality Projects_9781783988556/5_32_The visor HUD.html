<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec34"></a>The visor HUD</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>A heads-up<a id="id259" class="indexterm"></a> display, or HUD, is a floating canvas in your field of view that overlays the gameplay scene. In VR vernacular, there are two variations of HUDs. I'll call these variations the <span class="emphasis"><em>visor HUD</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>windshield HUD</em></span>. This section looks at the first one.</p><p>In visor HUD, the UI canvas is attached to the camera. It doesn't appear to respond to your head movement. When you move your head, it appears to be <span class="emphasis"><em>stuck to your face</em></span>. Let's look at a nicer way of visualizing it. Let's suppose that you're wearing a helmet with a visor and the UI appears projected onto the surface of the visor. There may be contexts where this is OK in virtual reality, but it is likely to break the sense of immersion. So, it should generally only be used either when the visor is a part of the gameplay, or if the intent is to take you out of the scene, such as the utility menus for the hardware or the system.</p><p>Let's make a visor HUD with a welcome message as follows, and see for ourselves how it feels:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, unfold the <code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code> object and then drill down to the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object (for Oculus, we placed it as an immediate child of <code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code>; for Cardboard, you need to go deeper to <code class="literal">CardboardMain/Head/</code>).</p></li><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, drag the <code class="literal">DefaultCanvas</code> prefab onto the <code class="literal">Camera</code> object so that it becomes a child of <code class="literal">Camera</code>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, with the canvas selected, rename the canvas to <code class="literal">VisorCanvas</code>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel for the canvas, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Pos X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Z</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>).</p></li><li><p>Unfold <code class="literal">VisorCanvas</code> and select the child <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> object.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, change the text from <span class="strong"><strong>Default Text</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome! Mi reality es su reality</strong></span>. (You can enter line breaks in the input text area.)</p></li><li><p>Change the text color to something bright, such as green.</p></li><li><p>Disable the <code class="literal">Image</code> object so that only the text shows, by unchecking its <span class="strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span> checkbox in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Save the scene, and try it in VR.</p></li></ol></div><p>Here's a<a id="id260" class="indexterm"></a> capture of the Rift screen with the <code class="literal">VisorCanvas</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_05_06.jpg" /></div><p>In VR, when you move your head around, the text follows along as if it's attached to a visor in front of your face.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"></a>Note</h3><p>A visor HUD canvas and reticle cursor canvas are set as a child object of the camera.</p></div><p>Now, go ahead and either disable <code class="literal">VisorCanvas</code>, or just delete it (in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, right-click on it and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span>) because we're going to show the welcome message in a different way in a later topic. Next, we'll look at a different application of this technique.</p></div>
