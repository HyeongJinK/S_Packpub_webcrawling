The Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> has tons of amazing models (plus many other kinds of assets), and there are lots of other websites with large communities that share 3D models for fun and profit. Where do these models come from? Will you run into problems while importing them into Unity?</p><p>I know that this book is about Unity, but we're going on a short side adventure right now. We're going to <a id="id108" class="indexterm"></a>use Blender (version 2.7x), a free and open source 3D animation suite (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org/</a>), to make a model and then import it into Unity. Grab a coffee and strap yourself in!</p><p>The plan is not to build anything very fancy right now. We'll just build a cube and a simple texture map. The purpose of this exercise is to find out how well a one-unit cube in Blender imports with the same scale and orientation into Unity.</p><p>Feel free <a id="id109" class="indexterm"></a>to skip this section or try a similar experiment using your favorite modeling software. If you prefer not to follow along or run into problems, a copy of the completed files created in this topic is available in the download package for this book.</p></div>
