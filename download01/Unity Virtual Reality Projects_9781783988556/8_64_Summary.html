We imported the model into Unity and added some environmental lighting. Then, we built an artwork rig consisting of an image quad, a picture frame, and a spotlight, and placed instances of the rig on various walls throughout the gallery. Next, we imported a bunch of personal photos and wrote a script that populates the art frames at runtime. Finally, we wrote a script that takes the first-person camera on a walk-through of the scene, pausing to look at each picture one at a time for a nice, simple VR-on-rails experience.</p><p>Then, we had a detailed discussion about optimizing projects for performance and VR comfort, which means that you have to be mindful of your content and model complexity, the rendering pipeline, and the capabilities of your target platform.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at a different kind of VR experience using pre-recorded 360-degree media. You will build and learn about photospheres, equirectangular projections, and infographics.</p></div>
