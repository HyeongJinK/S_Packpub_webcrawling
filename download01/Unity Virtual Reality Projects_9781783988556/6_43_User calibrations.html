Are you presently sitting or standing? Am I referring to your real-life human self or your player inside the virtual world? Your first-person VR experience may not feel right if your virtual self isn't calibrated.</p><p>Mind you, I am not referring to your VR headset's physical configurations. For example, <span class="strong"><strong>Oculus Configuration Utility</strong></span> lets you calibrate the settings for <span class="emphasis"><em>eye relief</em></span> (how far the HMD lenses are from your eyes) and <span class="strong"><strong>Interpupillary Distance</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IPD</strong></span>) (distance between your eyes), which <a id="id348" class="indexterm"></a>affect the low-level distortion rendering that is performed by the SDK drivers. Although those may be important to have a satisfactory experience, I'm referring to calibrating the in-game character in the scene with youâ€”the player.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec72"></a>A character's height</h3></div></div></div><p>I do<a id="id349" class="indexterm"></a> not know whether you've been paying much attention to the first-person camera height, but it appears that we shrunk recently. Before this chapter, the eye-level of the camera was set to be eye-to-eye with Ethan. Now, we're looking at his chest. What happened?</p><p>If you've been following along, in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>VR Build and Run</em></span>, we created a <code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code> object located at 1.4 meters as shown in the following screenshot (<code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code> has <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> = <code class="literal">1.4</code>) to be at about eye-level with Ethan. The camera<a id="id350" class="indexterm"></a> child object has a relative position of (0,0,0) so that it's coincident:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_06_13.jpg" /></div><p>Then, earlier in this chapter, we added a Character Controller component to <code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code>, which includes a Capsule Collider with a default height of 2.0. The <code class="literal">Transform.position</code> prefab now represents the center of the capsule as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_06_14.jpg" /></div><p>Then, when <a id="id351" class="indexterm"></a>we play the scene (and call <code class="literal">SimpleMove</code>), gravity kicks in, dropping the object so that it makes contact with the ground, moving the center and the camera to <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>= <code class="literal">1.0</code> as shown in the following screenshot. (You can see this happen immediately when you press the Play Mode):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783988556/graphics/B04781_06_15.jpg" /></div><p>We need<a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a> to clean this up.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Feature</strong></span>: <span class="emphasis"><em>As a first-person character, my eye-level should be at 1.4 meters.</em></span>
</p><p>Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With <code class="literal">MeMyselfEye</code> selected in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">1.08</code>.</p></li><li><p>With its child VR <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> selected, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> value of <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0.4</code>.</p></li><li><p>If you still have the dashboard that we built in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>World Space UI</em></span>, in this scene, with the <code class="literal">Dashboard</code> child selected, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Pos Y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">-0.6</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>The capsule's full height is 2.0. So, we set its position to <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> = <code class="literal">1.08</code>. Why the extra 0.08? It has a default <span class="strong"><strong>Skin Width</strong></span> of 0.08 (<span class="emphasis"><em>skin</em></span> is a Unity fudge factor that lets characters fit through narrow passages). We want the camera height to be 0.4 above the center of the capsule. We will also adjust the dashboard as before to be one meter below the eye level. (These are my settings. For example, you can set the skin to <code class="literal">0.001</code> and the capsule height to <code class="literal">1.6</code> and make other adjustments accordingly.)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec73"></a>Real-life height of a player</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're <a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a>actually 1.6 meters tall (5 feet, 3 inches), then this eye level may feel normal when you play the character in VR. If you're actually taller (or shorter), it may feel weird.</p><p>At this point, you need to ask yourself, <span class="emphasis"><em>what is the intent of the application or game?</em></span> Are you playing as a kid that's Ethan's size? Alternatively, do you want to create a VR experience that makes you feel that you are being transported into a virtual world? Is your character standing up or sitting down?</p><p>The first case is easier. Let's say that you're in a VR game. Let's say you're <span class="emphasis"><em>Mario</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Luigi</em></span>. Then, you're playing a short guy, and it's OK to see the world from that height. You're not going to be six feet tall, even if that's how tall you are in real life. Likewise, if you're <span class="emphasis"><em>Bowser</em></span>, you'll need to be about ten feet tall. So whatever height you, the game designer, chooses will be fine.</p><p>The second case, where you're designing an experience to transport the actual user to a new virtual place, you will want the camera height close to the actual player's eye level. Depending on your project, it might be fine to pick the average human height worldwide (1.7 meters).</p><p>If you want to fine-tune it, your app can have a calibration menu that lets users enter their actual height or choose from a list, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Short</em></span> / <span class="emphasis"><em>Average</em></span> / <span class="emphasis"><em>Tall</em></span>. The Oculus Rift includes a <span class="strong"><strong>Configuration Utility</strong></span> that lets you predefine one or more user profiles. This includes height and gender, which are accessible to all the Rift apps through their API.</p><p>If your character is sitting, the eye-level height may be less of an issue because we're accustomed to sitting at desks of a standard height (for example, 28 inches) and adjusting our chairs to meet that height.</p><p>When virtual reality equipment advances to the point where hand and body sensors are more common, we'll need calibration tools and user profiles to help players feel more at home in their virtual bodies.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"></a>Note</h3><p>When you're impersonating a character in a game, you set the camera to the character's height. When you're virtually transporting the user into a new virtual place, you want to set the camera to their actual eye level.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec74"></a>Recentering</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes in <a id="id354" class="indexterm"></a>VR, the view presented in the headset is not quite in sync with your body's orientation. Device SDKs provide functions to reset the orientation of the headset with respect to the real-world space. This is often referred to as<a id="id355" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>recentering</strong></span> of the view.</p><p>For the Oculus Rift, you might add a script that listens for a specific key press, such as the <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> key to <span class="emphasis"><em>recenter</em></span> the view or a utility HUD menu button, and calls <code class="literal">InputTracking.Recenter()</code>.</p><p>Google <a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a>Cardboard has a similar function to reset the HMD orientation. It of course, doesn't have positional tracking. Only the orientation and motion sensors are reset by calling <code class="literal">Cardboard.SDK.Recenter()</code>.</p></div></div>
