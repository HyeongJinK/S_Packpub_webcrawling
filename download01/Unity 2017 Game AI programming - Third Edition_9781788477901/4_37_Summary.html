From simple waypoints, to the efficient and fast A* algorithm, to Unity's own powerful and robust NavMesh system, we've added some important and flexible tools to your game-making toolbelt. Not only do these concepts play well with each other, but they also work well with other systems we've already seen in this book, and we'll explore in those next few chapters.</p><p>In the next chapter,<span class="emphasis"><em>Â </em></span>we'll start to look at how we can create efficient and realistic simulations for groups of agents that need to move in unison. Let's get to it!</p></div>
