Not only are you able to purchase art, audio, and other kinds of assets, but it is also populated with a large number of plugins and frameworks. Most relevant to our purposes, there are a number of behavior tree plugins available on the asset store, ranging from free to a few hundred dollars. Most, if not all, provide some sort of GUI to make visualizing and arranging a fairly painless experience.</p><p>There are many advantages of going with an off-the-shelf <span>solution</span><a id="id288183610" class="indexterm"></a> from the asset store. Many of the frameworks include advanced functionality such as runtime (and often visual) debugging, robust APIs, serialization, and data-oriented tree support. Many even include sample leaf logic nodes to use in your game, minimizing the amount of coding you have to do to get up and running.</p><p>The previous edition of this book, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity 4.x Game AI Programming</em></span>, focused on developer AngryAnt's Behave plugin, which is currently available as Behave 2 for Unity on the asset store as a paid plugin, which continues to be an excellent choice for your behavior tree needs (and so much more). It is a very robust, performant, and excellently designed framework.</p><p>Some other alternatives are <span class="strong"><strong>Behavior Machine</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Behavior Designer</strong></span>, which offer <span>different</span><a id="id288559445" class="indexterm"></a> pricing tiers (Behavior Machine even offers a free edition) and a wide array of <span>useful</span><a id="id288559451" class="indexterm"></a> features. Many other options can be found for free around the web as both generic C# and Unity-specific implementations. Ultimately, as with any other system, the choice of rolling your own or using an existing solution will depend on your time, budget, and project.</p></div>
