As we discussed earlier, a character AI system needs to have awareness of its environment such as where the obstacles are, where the enemy it is looking for is, whether the enemy is visible in the player's sight, and so on. The quality of our NPC's AI completely depends on the information it can get from the environment. Nothing breaks the level of immersion in a game like an NPC getting stuck behind a wall. Based on the information the NPC can collect, the AI system can decide which logic to execute in response to that data. If the sensory systems do not provide enough data, or the AI system is unable to properly take action on that data, the agent can begin to glitch, or behave in a way contrary to what the developer, or more importantly the player, would expect. Some games have become infamous for their comically bad AI glitches, and it's worth a quick internet search to find some videos of AI glitches for a good laugh.</p><p>We can detect all the environment parameters and check them against our predetermined values if we want. But using a proper design pattern will help us maintain code and thus will be easy to extend. This chapter will introduce a design pattern that we can use to implement sensory systems.
