We'll learn how to implement each of these features in Unity in the upcoming chapters. Unity is a flexible engine that provides a number of approaches to implement AI patterns. Some are ready to go out of the box, so to speak, while others we'll have to build from scratch. In this book, we'll focus on implementing the most essential AI patterns within Unity so that you can get your game's AI entities up and running quickly. Learning and implementing the <span>techniques</span><a id="id288183617" class="indexterm"></a> within this book will serve as a fundamental first step in the vast world of AI. Many of the concepts we will cover in this book, such as pathfinding and Navigation Meshes, are interconnected and build on top of one another. For this reason, it's important to get the fundamentals right first before digging into the high-level APIs that Unity provides.</p></div>
