As you'll see in this chapter, flocks are relatively simple to implement, and they add a fairly extraordinary amount of realism to your simulation in just a few lines of code. Crowds can be a bit more complex, but we'll be exploring some of the powerful tools that come bundled with Unity to get the job done. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learning the history of flocks and herds</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the concepts behind flocks</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Flocking using the traditional algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using realistic crowds</li></ul></div></div>
