The sensory system is one component of the whole decision-making system. We can use the sensory system in combination with a behavior system to execute certain behaviors for certain senses. For example, we can use an FSM to change to <strong class="userinput"><code>Chase</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Attack</code></strong> states from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Patrol</code></strong> state once we have detected that there's an enemy within line of sight. We'll also cover how to apply behavior tree systems in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Trees</em></span>.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll be looking at popular pathfinding algorithms. We'll learn how to make our AI agent navigate complex environments using the ever-popular A* pathfinding algorithm, and even Unity's own <code class="literal">NavMesh</code> system.</p></div>
