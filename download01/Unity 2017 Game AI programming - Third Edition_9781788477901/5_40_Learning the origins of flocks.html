It was first <span>developed</span><a id="id288183624" class="indexterm"></a> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Craig Reynolds</em></span>, who developed it for use in films, the most famous adaptation of the technology being the swarm of bats in <span class="emphasis"><em>Batman Returns</em></span> in 1992, for which he won an Oscar. Since then, the use of the flocking algorithm has expanded beyond the world of film into various fields, from games to scientific research. Despite being relatively efficient and accurate, the algorithm is also very simple to understand and implement.</p></div>
