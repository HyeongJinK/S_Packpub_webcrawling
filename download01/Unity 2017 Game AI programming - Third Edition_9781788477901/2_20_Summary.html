We learned about state machine behaviors and transitions between states. With all of these concepts covered, we then applied the simple state machine to an agent, thus creating our first artificially intelligent entity!</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll continue to build our tank game and give our agent more complex methods for sensing the world around it.</p></div>
