These will be short but wide cubes grouped under an empty game object called <code class="literal">Obstacles</code>.</li><li>Add a plane to be used as a floor.</li><li>Then, we add a directional light so that we can see what is going on in our scene.</li></ol></div><p>As you can see in the example, there is a target 3D model, which we use for our player, and we represent our AI agent using a simple cube.Â We will also have a <code class="literal">Target</code> object to show us where the tank will move to in our scene.</p><p>For simplicity, our example provides a point light as a child of the <code class="literal">Target</code> so that we can easily see our target destination in the game view. Our scene hierarchy will look similar to the <span>following</span><a id="id288559454" class="indexterm"></a> screenshot after you've set everything up correctly:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788477901/graphics/6c2a9a28-bbd1-463a-9987-4b94ac263217.png" /></div><p>The scene hierarchy</p><p>Now we will position the tank, the AI character, and walls randomly in our scene. Increase the size of the plane to something that looks good. Fortunately, in this demo, our objects float, so nothing will fall off the plane. Also, be sure to adjust the camera so that we can have a clear view of the following scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788477901/graphics/6002d238-647d-4233-8cb7-eb77e8d4bcc7.png" /></div><p>Our game scene
</p><p>With the essential setup out of the way, we can begin tackling the code for driving the various systems.</p></div>
