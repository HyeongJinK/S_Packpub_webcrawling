In this chapter, we took a few of the concepts covered in the book and applied them to create a small tank-defense game. We built upon the concept of finite state machines, which we originally covered in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02"><span>Chapter 2</span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finite State Machines and You</em></span>, and created an artificial intelligence to drive our enemy towers' behavior. We then enhanced the behavior by combining it with sensing and perception, and finally we implemented navigation via Unity's NavMesh feature to help our tank AI navigate through our maze-like level, through a gauntlet of autonomous AI towers with one thing on their simple AI minds: destroy!</p><p>As we conclude this book, take a moment and pat yourself on the back! We've covered a lot of ground, and covered a lot of topics. You've now learned about state machines, behavior trees, A*, fuzzy logic, and so much more. What's most exciting is to think of all the ways in which you can mix-and-match and apply these concepts. Hopefully, throughout this book you've been thinking of ways to enhance your existing or upcoming games with these concepts. You now have the tools to create smarter inhabitants for your digital worlds. Good luck!</p></div>
