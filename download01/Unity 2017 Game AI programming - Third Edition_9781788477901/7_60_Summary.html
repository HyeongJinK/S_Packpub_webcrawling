Fuzzy logic tends to become far less fuzzy once you understand the basic concepts. Being one of the more pure math concepts in the book, it can be a little daunting if you're not familiar with the lingo, but when presented in a familiar context, the mystery fades away, and you're left with a very powerful tool to use in your game.</p><p>We learned how fuzzy logic is used in the real world, and how it can help illustrate vague concepts in a way that binary systems cannot. We also learned how to implement our own fuzzy logic controllers using the concepts of member functions, degrees of membership, and fuzzy sets. In addition to this, we also played around with a faction/morality system to further illustrate the concept of fuzzy logic in the context of a choose-your-own-adventure-style interaction. Lastly, we explored the various ways in which we can use the resulting data, and how it can help make our agents more unique.</p><p>In the final chapter, we will look at several of the concepts introduced in this book working together.</p><p> </p></div>
