The original stays safe and sound in the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> container in your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Naturally, we want this explosion to appear whenever we detect that the bomb has hit the ground. We've already put the logic in place to detect a ground hit—remember that we're moving the bomb back up into the sky as soon as it drops below ground level. So it should be a reasonable hop, skip, and jump towards making that explosion happen. And luckily, it is!</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open up your <span class="strong"><strong>Bomb</strong></span> Script and add the following variable at the very top:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>var prefab:GameObject;</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>Then, just after the code where we detect a ground hit, add this line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">if(transform.position.y &lt; 0)
{
<span class="strong"><strong>  Instantiate(prefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);</strong></span>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>We created a<a id="id755" class="indexterm"></a> variable called <code class="literal">prefab</code> at the top of the script to store some sort of <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. Note that small-p "prefab" is not a Unity keyword—we're calling it that because calling it "monkeybutt" would make the code even more confusing.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Instantiate</code> command does exactly what you suspect it does. We need to pass it a reference to a <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> (in our case, we've got one stored in the <code class="literal">prefab</code> variable), along with arguments to determine the position and the rotation of the thing. Then Unity goes looking for the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> we specified, and places it in the game at the position/rotation we specify.</p><p>What do we pass for the position value? The bomb's own position, before we move the bomb to the top of the apartment building. And what do we pass in for its rotation? SCARY MATH! BLAH!!</p><p>Once again, I'm not even going to pretend that I understand Quaternion mathematics. What I do know is that <code class="literal">Quaternion.identity</code> means "no rotation"—the object is aligned perfectly with the world or parent axes.</p></div>
