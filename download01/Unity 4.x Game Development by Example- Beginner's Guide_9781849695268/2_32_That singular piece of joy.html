What's fun about each of them? Which moments in a game like Master of Orion really turn your crank? Do you like mining a planet for resources and buying new stuff? Do you like the thrill of discovering a new planet? Or does building an armada of spaceships and conquering enemies really get you excited?</p><p>Distill your game down to that one thingâ€”that <span class="emphasis"><em>singular piece of joy</em></span>. Create that one joyful experience for your player, and nail it. That's your game. Everything else is just feature creep.</p></div>
