We're going to focus on small, simple, and fun game mechanics. Once you close the back cover of this book, you can take those simple concepts and iterate on them, even blowing them out to ambitious fully featured crazy-fests such as Master of Orion or Mario Power Tennis. But stick to the strategy that will make you successful throughoutâ€”start at zero, discover that singular piece of joy, and iterate until your game is finished.</p></div></div>
