<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch06lvl1sec166"></a>What exactly is "this"?</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Did the <code class="literal">this.img = img;</code> line trip you up? Here's what's going on with that.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Card</code> class has <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>an instance variable called <code class="literal">img</code>. We're also passing an argument to its constructor function with the exact same name, <code class="literal">img</code>. If we simply wrote <code class="literal">img = img;</code>, that means we'd be setting the value of the argument to the value of the argument. Hunh! That's not quite what we're after.</p><p>By specifying <code class="literal">this.img = img;</code>, we're saying that we want the <code class="literal">img</code> variable attached to this, the <code class="literal">Card</code> class, to have the same value as the <span class="emphasis"><em>argument</em></span> called <code class="literal">img</code>.</p><p>It's a smidge confusing, I'll admit. So, why not just call the argument something different? You absolutely could! We did it this way because it's very common to see variables passed to the constructor function with the same name as the instance variables in the class. You may as well encounter it here with a full explanation, than come across it in the wild and let it gnaw your leg off.</p><p>Here's one more look at another, completely imaginary class that does the same kind of thing. Stare at it, absorb it, and be at peace with it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">class Dog extends System.Object
{
  // Declare some instance variables:
  var myName:String;
  var breed:String
  var age:int;

  function Dog(myName:String,breed:String,age:int)
  {
     this.myName = myName; // set the value of the instance variable
      "myName" to the value of the argument "myName"
     this.breed = breed; // set the value of the instance variable
      "breed" to the value of the argument "breed"
     this.age = age; // set the value of the instance variable "age"
      to the value of the argument "age"
  }
}</pre></div><p>It might help your understanding to know that those arguments that are passed into the constructor function have a limited <span class="strong"><strong>scope</strong></span>. They will disappear if we don't do something with them in the function. The instance variables declared at the top of the class have a broader <span class="strong"><strong>scope</strong></span>—they exist outside of all the functions, and they persist no matter what happens inside the functions. We take the values of the ephemeral, soon-to-disappear arguments, and store them in the longer-term instance variables. We use the keyword <code class="literal">this</code> to tell the difference between the two.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec68"></a>Have a go hero – grokketh-thou Random.Range()?</h3></div></div></div><p>As long as we're taking some time to let it all sink in, let's do another pass on this <code class="literal">Random.Range()</code> method. If <code class="literal">Random.Range()</code> is not clear to you yet, try building a test loop at the bottom of the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function and logging the results:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>for(i=0; i&lt;1000; i++)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>{</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>   Debug.Log(Random.Range(0,10));</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>}</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Test and run. Make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window is open (<span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>), and make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>Collapse</strong></span> is unchecked—otherwise, you'll see only the last few log lines. You should also ensure there are no other <code class="literal">print()</code> or <code class="literal">Debug.Log()</code> statements cluttering the console. Use double-slashes <code class="literal">//</code> to comment those out for the time being.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_06_05.jpg" /></div><p>The number Unity spits out should never equal ten (provided you're using ints and not floats).
