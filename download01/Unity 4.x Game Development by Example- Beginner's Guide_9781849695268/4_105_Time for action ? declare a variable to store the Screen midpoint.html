<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened – we've gone too var</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We've used the special <code class="literal">var</code> keyword to declare our variable (bucket). I chose the name <code class="literal">halfW</code>, which is short for "half width"—half the width of the screen. You can choose any name you like for a variable as long as it isn't a reserved Unity keyword, and it doesn't break any of the naming rules that we discussed when we looked at naming functions. For example, <code class="literal">1myvar funfun</code> will <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> work, because it begins with a number and has a space in the middle. Also, it sounds ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. Try your best to keep your variable names logical.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>F is for function</strong></span>
</p><p>The biggest difference between naming a function and naming a variable in Unity is that a function name should start with a<a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a> capital letter, while a variable name should not. This is<a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a> not a hard and fast rule, but it's called a "best practice", which means that everyone else does it, so you should too. Jump off a bridge with us!</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_22.jpg" /></div><p>We stuck a colon and the word <code class="literal">float</code> at the end of our variable name. Why? By using a colon, we're telling <a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a>Unity what <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> of variable we're using. This lets the program know how big of a bucket in memory to create. Giving a variable a type speeds up our game because Unity doesn't have to keep guessing what type of bucket <code class="literal">halfW</code> is.</p><p>
<code class="literal">float</code> is short for a <span class="emphasis"><em>single-precision floating point</em></span>. To you and me, that's a number with a decimal point in it. Here are a few more data types that Unity uses:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">String</code>: An alphanumeric bunch of characters such as "Hello, my name is Herb" or "123 Fake St"</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Boolean</code>: Like a light switch, a <code class="literal">Boolean</code> can be only one of two states—<code class="literal">true</code> or <code class="literal">false</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">int</code>: An integer, such as 28 or -7</p></li></ul></div><p>Our <code class="literal">halfW</code> variable is<a id="id330" class="indexterm"></a> typed as <code class="literal">float</code> because we need that decimal place. But we're not splitting the atom or anything, so we don't need to make it a <code class="literal">double</code>, which is a more accurate numerical data type that can store a number with many more digits in it.</p><p>Save the Script and test your game to make sure everything is working correctly.</p></div></div>
