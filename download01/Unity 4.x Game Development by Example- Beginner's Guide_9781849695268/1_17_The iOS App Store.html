On any given day, a good number of the games on the "Top 100" list are Unity-made titles. For a particularly good time, try <span class="strong"><strong>The Room</strong></span>, which is a short-and-sweet <span class="strong"><strong>MYST</strong></span>-like game that will have you safe-cracking increasingly complex puzzle boxes nested inside one another. Again, a significant amount of time, talent, and effort went into creating The Room, but this tour is about getting a feel for what Unity can doâ€”and what you can do with it (given enough time, talent, and effort!). </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_28.jpg" /></div></div>
