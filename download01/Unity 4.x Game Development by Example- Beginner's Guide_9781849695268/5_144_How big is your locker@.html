You need to tell Unity how many things you're putting inside, and that number can never change. Other Collections, like Generic Lists, can take <a id="id420" class="indexterm"></a>whatever we throw at themâ€”their length is elastic, and they don't have to have a set size. Which approach is better? As you'll see, there are advantages and disadvantages to each.</p><p>You'll remember that when we define a variable (a bucket that can hold one thing), we're actually carving out a storage locker in the computer's memory. By <span class="emphasis"><em>typing</em></span> the variable (giving it a <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span>), we're telling the computer how big that storage locker needs to be. An <code class="literal">int</code> variable needs a different amount of room in memory than a <code class="literal">string</code> variable or a <code class="literal">boolean</code> variable, and so on.</p><p>It's the same idea with a Collection. If we tell Unity how many elements an array needs to hold, Unity can reserve the right amount of space in memory and call it a day. Imagine if you were moving house, and you had to rent a storage locker, but the amount of stuff you needed to store was constantly changing. You'd need to rent more lockers, or bigger lockers, and then get rid of them and consolidate your things, and then rent another few lockers again. What a hassle! We reap the benefit of a fast Collection when we use a built-in Array, and tell Unity exactly how many things it needs to hold.</p><p>This is what it might look like if we used one line of code to declare and define a 20-piece bucket of fried chicken with absolutely no tennis shoes in it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var aDefinitelyFriedChicken:FriedChicken[] = new FriedChicken[20];</pre></div><p>So if you had the choice of <a id="id421" class="indexterm"></a>using a sleek, speedy Built-In Array with its fixed size, why would we ever want to use the slower <code class="literal">Generic List</code> class, with its flexible size? Well, one advantage of the <code class="literal">Generic List</code> class is that it has a few methods that the stripped-down, no-nonsense Built-in Array doesn't have. We're going to use one of those methods unique to the <code class="literal">Generic List</code> class a little later in the code. And who the heck knows how much stuff they're going to want to cram into their storage locker ahead of time? Flexible Collection size is a real advantage in some situations. For now, let's keep on trucking. We have a game to build!</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip26"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>"A" is for Anal Retentiv</strong></span>e</p><p>Programmers develop their own naming conventions for things. My own best practice when declaring Collections like Arrays and Lists is to begin them with a lowercase letter "a". It's just a code organization technique that helps me keep everything straight in my head.</p></div></div>
