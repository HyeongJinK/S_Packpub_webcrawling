A technique called <span class="strong"><strong>mip-mapping</strong></span> reduces this effect. Unity creates a series of images from your texture that are each half the size of the previous image, which allows the computer to figure out the best pixel colors to show to the player, reducing the sparkle effect.</p><p>Because our title screen is presented as-is with no 3D camera movement, we're not really concerned about sparkle. And, as you can imagine, with all those extra images, mip-mapping requires a decent amount of extra memory for storage. As we don't need mip-mapping—adding that extra bulk—let's disable it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With the "title" texture image selected, find the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> checkbox in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>Uncheck the box.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to save these changes.</p></li><li><p>The rest of the images that you imported should not be mip-mapped, but there's no harm in checking them for peace of mind.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_05_24.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div>
