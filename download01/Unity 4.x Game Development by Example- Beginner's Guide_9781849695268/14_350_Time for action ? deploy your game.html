<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch14lvl1sec345"></a>Time for action â€“ deploy your game</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>You may be wondering<a id="id1076" class="indexterm"></a> why the section on deploying your game has been squeezed into a tiny section at the very end of the book. That's because Unity makes it so darned simple to package up your game, that we don't need any more space. Here's how to do it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the menu, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File | Build Settings...</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>We need to add the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span> to this list that we want bundled into our <a id="id1077" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>game</strong></span> file. The first <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> we add to the list will be the first one Unity displays to our player, so that's where our preloader or title screen should normally go.</p><p>Because we have only one <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> in this game so far, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button to pop it into the list. In games with multiple <a id="id1078" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span>, you can simply click-and-drag those <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span> into the list to add them to the build. Be sure to choose <span class="strong"><strong>Web Player</strong></span> as your deployment preference if you'd like a file that can be played in a browser.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_14_33.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on the <a id="id1079" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Build And Run</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>Unity asks where you want to save the <code class="literal">.unity3d</code> game file. Choose a folder and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>In the background, Unity cranks out a <code class="literal">.unity3d</code> file and an <code class="literal">.html</code> file to house it. Then Unity<a id="id1080" class="indexterm"></a> throws us to our default web browser and opens the HTML file. And there's our game, running beautifully within the browser.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_14_34.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>To publish the game live to the world, just upload the <code class="literal">.unity3d</code> file and the <code class="literal">.html</code> file to your web host, or pop it onto one of the Unity game portals we looked at off the top of the book. Unity support grows on a daily basis, so there are bound to be many more places hosting Unity games by the time you read this paragraph.</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that you can also deploy your game as a standalone version to run on the Mac, PC and Linux platforms. And if you spring for additional Unity licenses and development kits, you can deploy your content to a growing list of platforms, including popular consoles, phones and<a id="id1081" class="indexterm"></a> tablets.</p></div>
