As we saw in the previous chapter, a classic board game like <span class="emphasis"><em>Battleship</em></span> is set up in a grid. So are about 50 other board games I can think of off the top of my head: <span class="emphasis"><em>Connect Four</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Guess Who</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Stratego</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>chess</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>tic-tac-toe</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Clue</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>checkers</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>chutes n' ladders</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>go</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>slider puzzles</em></span>, and so on—it's an absolutely huge list. Add to that the slew of digital games that use a grid layout: <span class="emphasis"><em>MineSweeper</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tetris</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bejewelled</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Puzzle League</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bomberman</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Mario</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Breakout</em></span>. And lest you think that only 2D games use grids, consider 3D turn-based strategy games—the action takes place on a grid! Grids are used in inventory screens, in image galleries, and on level select screens. A* (A-star), a popular method for moving characters around obstacles on the screen ("pathfinding"), can also use grids. In fact, your entire computer display is a grid of square pixels.</p><p>Mastering the grid is key to mastering game development. You'll use grids again and again, from the main mechanic to the interface to perhaps even the high score table at the end of the game. The 2D array method we learned in the last chapter is just one way of setting up a grid, but it's a great one to start with.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec64"></a>Do the random card shuffle</h3></div></div></div><p>What fun is a flip n' match memory game<a id="id455" class="indexterm"></a> if all the cards are face up, and they all have the same image on them? Answer: no fun. No fun at all. What we <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> is to deal out a bunch of different cards. And, as long as we're shooting for the moon here, why not deal out a <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> bunch of cards every time we play?</p><p>We're going to define a List to represent our entire deck of cards. Then, we'll randomly draw a card from that deck and put it on the table—just like we would in real life.</p></div></div>
