<span class="emphasis"><em>Way back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Start with the Sky</em></span>, we talked about the difference between a game's mechanics and its skin. We've used Unity to create some very simple games with funny, strange, or interesting skins. In this chapter, we'll investigate the enormous difference a new skin can make to our games.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>We're going to<a id="id822" class="indexterm"></a> re-skin The Break-Up from the last <a id="id823" class="indexterm"></a>few chapters as a completely different game: a sci-fi space shooter (think Galaga, Space Invaders, Centipede, and so on). We're going to leverage the work we've already done on The Break-Up to create a game with a very different feel, but the guts will be the same. In the industry, we call this getting more products for less effort, and it's a very good plan. When you break it down, there's not much difference between a catch game and a space shooter. In both games, you're moving your character back and forth across the screen. In a catch game, you're trying to collide with valuable objects, while in a space shooter, you're trying to avoid dangerous objects—namely, enemy ships. Luckily, our catch game includes both colliding with and avoiding objects, so we're all set. The only other real difference is that a space shooter, by definition, requires shooting. You may be surprised to see how easy it is to include a new shooting feature based on techniques you've already learned!</em></span>
