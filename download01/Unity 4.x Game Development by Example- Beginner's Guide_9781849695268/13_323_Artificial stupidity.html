We now have a 2-player turn-based strategy game with a computer opponent. The human player can win and, with a little luck (and some rotten playing on the human's part), the computer player can win.</p><p>Try playing a few rounds of the worst Tic Tac Toe of your life. The computer player can win, but it's almost a challenge to play so badly that you lose to your artificially "intelligent" opponent.</p><p>Randomly choosing an empty Square isn't going to cut it. We need to make the computer opponent smarter. To do that, we have to sit down and study Tic Tac Toe until we understand what makes it ... ahem ... <span class="emphasis"><em>tick</em></span>. We need to be experts at how to play, and win, Tic Tac Toe. The computer scientists who programmed Big Blue to defeat Kasparov had to go through the same process with a considerably more complicated game, studying the intricacies of chess so they could teach a computer how to strategize.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec122"></a>Have a go hero – solve Tic Tac Toe</h3></div></div></div><p>Tic Tac Toe is what ludologists (people who study games) call a "solved game<a id="id974" class="indexterm"></a>". A solved game is one <a id="id975" class="indexterm"></a>where you can reliably predict the outcome of a match from any point, as long as both players play "perfectly", or optimally, without making any strategic errors. The process of solving a game can involve mapping out all of the game's possible states in a flowchart-like "game tree", and from that chart, deriving a set of steps to follow that will produce the best possible outcome for either player.</p><p>The game tree <a id="id976" class="indexterm"></a>for Tic Tac Toe terminates in 138 different end states, as long as you don't include symmetries or board rotations. If you're feeling plucky, why not grab a pencil and a piece of paper and map out the game tree for Tic Tac Toe? Here's a nudge to get you started.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_01.jpg" /></div><p>At first glance, it seems like player 1 has nine different options for placing an X—after all, there are nine empty squares in the grid. Consider, though, that an X placed in the top left-hand corner is identical to an X <a id="id977" class="indexterm"></a>placed in the bottom right-hand corner, if you rotate the board. It's the same story with the sides.</p><p>In reality, at the beginning of a Tic Tac Toe game, there are only three unique moves a player can make: a corner, a side, or the center.</p><p>Consequently, the top of our game tree looks like this:</p><p>  </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_02.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Pursue the first branch<a id="id978" class="indexterm"></a> of the diagram where X takes a corner. O <a id="id979" class="indexterm"></a>can respond with five possible moves: an adjacent side, an opposite side, an adjacent corner, an opposite corner, or the center.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_03.jpg" /></div><p>The Tic Tac Toe game tree<a id="id980" class="indexterm"></a> begins to look more like a maniacal football coach's playbook.</p><p>From those five<a id="id981" class="indexterm"></a> options, you can keep<a id="id982" class="indexterm"></a> branching out until you find the inevitable conclusion for each one. Then go back, and doodle the possibilities for the remaining unexplored paths.</p><p>If drawing this game tree scratches a ludological (or obsessive-compulsive) itch for you, keep going until you find all the 138 terminal board positions. Finishing the game tree is not crucial to completing this chapter, but it will give you a good feel for the lengths to which some computer scientists will go to find the answers to burning questions, like "how do you win at Tic Tac Toe?".</p></div></div>
