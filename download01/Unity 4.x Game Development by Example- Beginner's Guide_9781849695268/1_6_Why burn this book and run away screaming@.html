Here are a few places where Unity<a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a> doesn't stack up against its rivals:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Learning Curve</strong></span>: Even with the abundance of training available, Unity largely requires developers to learn how to program and to deal with complex concepts such as <span class="strong"><strong>shaders</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>third dimension</strong></span>. If you've come to Unity after hearing "it makes game development simple! Anyone can do it!", you've been fed a hot bowl full of filthy lies.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cost</strong></span>: Bang for buck notwithstanding, when you get into a situation where you're buying pro versions of Unity for an entire development team, and the Unity Asset Server on top of that, as well as copies of the deployment add-ons, the cost begins to add up. I may have knocked XCode in the previous section, but it does have the advantage of being free.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Purity</strong></span>: If you're coming from a "pure" programming background, some of the ways in which you solve different problems in Unity may seem outright sacrilegious to you. If the thought of working within a GUI and dragging things on top of other things to create reflexive relationships gives you the willies, you may not dig the way Unity gets things done.</p></li></ul></div></div>
