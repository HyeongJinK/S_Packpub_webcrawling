<span class="emphasis"><em>One of the secret aspects of game development is that getting a mechanic working is often less challenging than getting an entire GAME working. Our keep-up game has a working mechanic, but it's clearly nothing like a finished game.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>In this chapter, we'll take a break from our keep-up game to add an important tool to our Unity game development tool belt: Graphical User Interface programming. Graphical User Interfaces, or GUIs<a id="id368" class="indexterm"></a> for short, include all of the buttons, sliders, dropdowns, arrows, and on-screen text that help players understand and move through your game. Unity has a whole separate GUI (pronounced "gooey") system that we'll start digging around in to flesh out our games a bit better. To get a good grasp on what the GUI system can do, we're going to program an entire working 2D flip n' match memory game in that system!</em></span>

</p><p>There's nothing particularly Unity-centric about what we're going to learn in this chapter. The techniques you learn here can generally be applied to other scripting languages to build the same game. Programming a memory game in Unity GUI is not much different from building one in <a id="id369" class="indexterm"></a>VB6, <a id="id370" class="indexterm"></a>Flash, <a id="id371" class="indexterm"></a>XNA, or<a id="id372" class="indexterm"></a> OBJ-C for iOS.</p></div><p>In this chapter, we'll:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Start building a working memory game called <span class="strong"><strong>Robot Repair</strong></span> using only the Unity GUI controls</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learn how to add buttons and images to the screen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Connect multiple scenes with buttons</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Practice our programming, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional Collections</p></li></ul></div><p>All set?
