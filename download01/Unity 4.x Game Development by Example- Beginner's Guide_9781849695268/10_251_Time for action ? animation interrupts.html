We just happen to have a reusable <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> that contains a satisfying bomb explosion. Wouldn't it be great if we could trigger that explosion to happen right on top of the character's face? (The character might disagree with us, but I say let's go for it!)</p></div></div>
