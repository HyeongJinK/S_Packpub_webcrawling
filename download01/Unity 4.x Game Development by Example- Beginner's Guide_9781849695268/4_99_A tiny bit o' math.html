Our paddle moves only to the right, along the positive X-axis, because we're working onl<a id="id319" class="indexterm"></a>y with positive numbers. We need some negative numbers in there so that the paddle will move to the left at some point. But, at what point?</p><p>Hmmâ€¦ what if we take half of the screen's width and <span class="emphasis"><em>subtract</em></span> it from <code class="literal">Input.mousePosition.x</code>? What does that do for us?</p><p>A quick trip to Unity Script Reference tells us how to find the width of the screen in pixels. Let's divide that <a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a>number by 2 and subtract it from the mouse position.</p><p>Change the <code class="literal">Debug.Log()</code> function call to look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Debug.Log(<span class="strong"><strong>Input.mousePosition.x - Screen.width/2</strong></span>);</pre></div><p>Save and test. Watch the bottom of the screen for the result.</p></div>
