Let's pretend we are the computer, and we see this situation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_04.jpg" /></div><p>It wouldn't make<a id="id983" class="indexterm"></a> sense to place an O anywhere but in X's way—otherwise, the computer loses. So we have our first rule:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Block opponent from winning</p></li></ul></div><p>Now let's look at this situation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_05.jpg" /></div><p>Sure, X is about to win, but O also has an opportunity to win. Which is more important: for O to keep X from winning, or for O to win? Clearly, it's more important for O to claim victory and win the game. So we have our second rule:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Win</p></li></ul></div><p>We just said that it's <span class="emphasis"><em>more important</em></span> for O to claim victory than to block X, so we've also established a preferred order for these two rules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Win</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Block</p></li></ul></div><p>Notice that our two statements<a id="id984" class="indexterm"></a> are already written in pseudocode. <code class="literal">Win()</code> and <code class="literal">Block()</code> could just as easily be written as function calls. If we keep this up, we can just convert our plain English statements into Unity JavaScript and, theoretically, our code will work in-game.</p></div>
