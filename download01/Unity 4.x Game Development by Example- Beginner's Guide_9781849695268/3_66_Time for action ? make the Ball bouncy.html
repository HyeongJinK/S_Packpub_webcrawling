These special materials change what happens when a collider hits another collider. We chose the one <a id="id235" class="indexterm"></a>called <span class="strong"><strong>Bouncy</strong></span>, and lo and behold, when the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> game object's <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere Collider</strong></span> hits the <span class="strong"><strong>Cube Collider</strong></span> of the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span>, it reacts like<a id="id236" class="indexterm"></a> a bouncy ball should. At our current phase of human technological progress, this is as close to a <span class="strong"><strong>Make Game</strong></span> button<a id="id237" class="indexterm"></a> as you're going to get!</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec42"></a>Have a go hero</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> package provided us with a <span class="strong"><strong>Bouncy</strong></span> physic material to use, but we could just as easily have created our own. If you want to create your own physic material from scratch, right-click/alternate-click on a blank area of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physic Material</strong></span>. Alternatively, you can click-and-hold the mouse button on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Physic Material</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_37.jpg" /></div><p>A new <span class="strong"><strong>Physic Material</strong></span> called (appropriately enough) <span class="strong"><strong>New Physic Material</strong></span> appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.<a id="id238" class="indexterm"></a> You can rename it the same way you renamed the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> game objects. Call it <span class="strong"><strong>BouncyBall</strong></span>.</p><p>Click to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Physic Material</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Its parameters are listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. If you're desperate to know what everything does, click on the blue book icon with the question mark on it, and prepare to be bored to tears by talk of anisotropic friction. Yawn! What you really want to do is change the <span class="strong"><strong>Bounciness</strong></span> to <code class="literal">1</code>, and set the <span class="strong"><strong>Bounce Combine</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Maximum</strong></span>. Or choose your own settings if you just want to see what they do:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_38.jpg" /></div><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> again. Find where the <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere Collider</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> parameter<a id="id239" class="indexterm"></a> is set to that built-in <span class="strong"><strong>Bouncy Physic Material</strong></span>. Drag-and-drop your <span class="strong"><strong>BouncyBall</strong></span> physic material into the slot where the built-in <span class="strong"><strong>Bouncy</strong></span> one is. Alternatively, you can choose your <span class="strong"><strong>BouncyBall</strong></span> physic material from the menu. The <span class="strong"><strong>Bouncy</strong></span> physic material is swapped out for your own custom-created <span class="strong"><strong>BouncyBall</strong></span> physic material.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>What a drag!</strong></span>
</p><p>We'll be pulling that same drag-and-drop maneuver again and again as we use Unity. If you weren't feeling up to trying those last steps, don't worry; you'll get plenty of chances to drag stuff around the interface as we build more games.</p></div><p>Test the game by clicking the Play button. The paddle is flat, the ball is bouncy, and everything seems right with the world! We haven't programmed any interactivity yet, but try moving and rotating the paddle around while the game is running using the Unity tools to get a sense of how the ball might react when we rig up mouse control in the next chapter. (You'll have to deselect <span class="strong"><strong>Maximize on Play</strong></span> to gain access to your tools to try this out in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.)  While any changes you make to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> don't "stick" while the game is playing, changes you make to elements in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel do get saved. This feature allows you to adjust things such as the <span class="strong"><strong>BouncyBall</strong></span> material's bounciness live while you play.</p></div></div>
