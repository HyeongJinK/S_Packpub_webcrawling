<span class="strong"><strong>BEDMAS</strong></span>: evaluate the Brackets first, then the Exponents, then Division, Multiplication, Addition, and finally Subtraction.</p><p>To wrap your brain around it, here's what we're doing, in pseudocode:</p><p>    (first thing)/(second thing)</p><p>We're dividing something by something else. The first thing is the -640 to 640 number range that we cooked up. The second thing is <code class="literal">Screen.width/2</code> (the screen's midpoint). We wrap all of that in a tasty <code class="literal">Debug.Log()</code> shell:</p><p>    Debug.Log((first thing)/(second thing));</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pseudocode</strong></span><a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a> is fake code that will not work if you type it into a Script. We're just using it to better understand the real code that we're writing. Some programmers use pseudocode to type their thoughts out with English words to help them puzzle through a problem. Then, they go back over the pseudocode and translate it into a language that the computer will understand—JavaScript, C#, and so on.</p></div><p>Now, we really have something. If you save and test and move the mouse cursor around, you'll see that as you get closer to the left edge of the screen, you get closer to -1. And, as you get closer to the right edge, you approach 1. In the middle, it's zero.</p><p>Copy or rewrite the chunk of code from the <code class="literal">Debug.Log()</code> statement to the line above it so that it now reads:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">transform.position.x = (<span class="strong"><strong>Input.mousePosition.x -Screen.width/2) / (Screen.width/2)</strong></span>;</pre></div><p>Save and test your file.</p></div>
