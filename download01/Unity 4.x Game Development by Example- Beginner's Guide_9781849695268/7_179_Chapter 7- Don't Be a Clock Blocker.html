<span class="emphasis"><em>We've taken a baby game like Memory and made it slightly cooler by changing the straight-up match mechanism and adding a twist: matching disembodied robot parts to their bodies. Robot Repair is a tiny bit more interesting and more challenging thanks to this simple modification.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>There are lots of ways we could make the game even more difficult: we could quadruple the number of robots, crank the game up to a 20x20 card grid, or rig Unity up to some peripheral device that issues a low-grade electrical shock to the player's fiddly bits every time he doesn't find a match. NOW who's making a baby game?</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>These ideas could take a lot of time though, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Return-On-Investment</strong></span> (ROI)<a id="id500" class="indexterm"></a> we see from these features may not be worth the effort. One cheap, effective way of amping up the game experience is to add a clock. Games have used clocks to make us nervous for time immemorial, and it's hard to find a video game in existence that doesn't include some sort of time pressure—from the increasing speed of falling Tetris pieces, to the countdown clock in every Super Mario Bros. level, to the hourglass timers packaged with many popular board games like Boggle, Taboo, and Scattergories.</em></span>
