Most of the assets were created with other software; Unity is the program you use to put everything together and to make it interactive. The Demo contains special models, such as the airlocks, which were imported from 3D software packages like <a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>3D Studio Max</strong></span>, <a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Maya</strong></span>, or <a id="id49" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Blender</strong></span>. Certain elements, like robot enemies, have scripts attached to them. <span class="strong"><strong>Scripts</strong></span> are lists of instructions that tell the items in the game world how to behave. </p><p>Throughout the book, we'll learn how to import 3D models and write scripts to control them. Let's take a quick look around the Unity interface and note a few points of interest.</p></div>
