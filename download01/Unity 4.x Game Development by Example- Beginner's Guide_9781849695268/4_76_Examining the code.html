Nearly all <a id="id272" class="indexterm"></a>single-line statements must end in a semicolon or the code might break. When code breaks, Unity uses a special pop-up window called the <a id="id273" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>console</strong></span> to tell us about it. When you have code that throws an error, we say there is a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> in your code.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Semi-confusing</strong></span>
</p><p>So why doesn't the function declaration have a semicolon? Why don't the curly braces each have one? It's because they're a different beast. They're not a single line of codeâ€”they're more like a house where code lives. If you start seeing the declaration and statement block as one complete thing instead of three different things, you'll be well on your way to getting past the confusing bracket hurdle that many new programmers face.</p></div><p>In order to understand the rest of that line, you need to realize that there is a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of code going on behind the scenes that you can't see. It looks like a bunch of pretty pictures to you and me, but the Unity team had<a id="id274" class="indexterm"></a> to write code to make it look that way. Behind each instance of your <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, and behind the Unity program itself, there are thousands of lines of code telling your computer what to show you.</p><p>Renderer is one <a id="id275" class="indexterm"></a>such piece of code. When you set the <code class="literal">enabled</code> property of your Ball's renderer to <code class="literal">false</code>, you're saying that you don't want Unity to draw the triangles in the mesh that makes up your ball.</p></div>
