When it's closer to the right edge, you get positive numbers. And, if you try to position your cursor at exactly the<a id="id321" class="indexterm"></a> halfway point, you get zero. This makes sense. We know that when the mouse is at the left edge, <code class="literal">Input.mousePosition.x</code> is zero. If we subtract half of the screen width from zero (on my monitor, that's 640 pixels), we get <span class="strong"><strong>-640</strong></span> at the left edge instead.</p><p>My screen is 1280 pixels wide, so I'm using 640 to represent half of its width. Your mileage may vary! Common screen widths are 800, 1024, 1152, 1280, 1600, or 1920.</p><p>When the mouse is in the middle of the screen, <code class="literal">Input.mousePosition.x</code> is <code class="literal">640</code>. It's at the halfway point. If we subtract half the screen width (640 in my case), we get zero.</p><p>When the mouse position is at the right edge of the screen, <code class="literal">Input.mousePosition.x</code> is almost at 1280 on my 1280-pixel-wide display (again, your mileage may vary). Subtract half the <code class="literal">Screen.width</code> and we get 640. <span class="strong"><strong>-640</strong></span> at the left edge, <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> in the middle, and <span class="strong"><strong>640</strong></span> at the right edge.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_20_new.jpg" /></div></div>
