<span class="emphasis"><em>We've been learning pieces of game development like Lego bricks. We've chugged along merrily on two tracks simultaneously: learning about what we need to build to have a complete game, and how we can use Unity to build those pieces.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Break-Up<a id="id679" class="indexterm"></a> will be a simple catch game. Catch is in a genre of what we now call mini-games—often, they are games within games. Catch, like keep-up, has a very simple mechanic. The player controls a thing, (like a paddle, a character, a bucket, or a trampoline), usually at the bottom of the screen, and other things fall or move towards the player-controlled thing from the top of the screen. In a catch game, the player has to connect his controllable thing with the falling things (people jumping out of buildings, cherries falling from a tree, and so on) to catch or collide with them. A common feature upgrade is to add bad things that the player must avoid.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>That's how the unskinned mechanic works. Of course, you can skin it in a million different ways. One of the earliest catch games I ever played was called Kaboom! on the Atari 2600. The player controlled a group of buckets, and had to catch bombs dropped by the Mad Bomber villain at the top of the screen.</em></span>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_09_01.jpg" /></div><p>The skin I've cooked up for the Break-Up puts you in the role of a guy who's been kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend. Your most prized possessions are your Beer Steins of the World collection and your cartoon bomb collection, and your ex-girlfriend is throwing both of them out of the window! The bombs, naturally, are lit. You have to catch the fragile beer steins and avoid the bombs.</p><p>That skin is<a id="id680" class="indexterm"></a> clearly just a little west of nuts, but it shows how far you can go with the fictional wallpaper on a simple mechanic.</p><p>So what are we going to need? We should have some kind of backdrop to set the scene, some beer stein and bomb models, and a character. Ideally, that character should be animated. Oh, and we should probably learn how to blow stuff up too, because blowing stuff up is awesome. In this chapter, let's learn:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to set up animations from external models</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to create particle effects like explosions and sparks</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to use <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span><a id="id681" class="indexterm"></a> to handle multiple copies of the same <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>

Be sure to include the <code class="literal">Particles.unityPackage</code> file from the list. Once your project starts up, save the default <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and call it <code class="literal">Game</code>. Next, download and import the <a id="id682" class="indexterm"></a>assets package required for this chapter, and all of the goodies you need to build the game will show up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, in their own <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Models</strong></span> folders.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip44"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Conversion perversion</strong></span>
</p><p>As with the heart, hands, and tray models from our Ticker Taker project, these particular goodies were created in Blender, a free 3D modeling package. Then they were exported to the <code class="literal">.fbx</code> format, a common format among different 3D software packages. The drawback in converting your work to a common format is that certain things can be lost in translation—pieces of the geometry can be flipped inside out, textures can show up in the wrong place or not at all, and the model might not look the way you want it to. Remember that Unity can recognize a number of native 3D file formats. There are advantages and disadvantages to working with native file formats instead of common formats like <code class="literal">.fbx</code>, which you'll discover as you gain more experience with Unity.</p></div></div>
