We want to create 16 new cards and put them into our deck, the <code class="literal">aGrid</code> array. To do that, we're using an "iterative loop"<a id="id424" class="indexterm"></a> to populate our two-dimensional array.</p><p>An iterative loop is a piece of code that repeats itself, with special instructions telling it when to start and when to end. If a loop never ends, our game crashes, and we're flooded with angry tech support calls.</p><p>This line begins an iterative loop:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">for(var i:int=0; i&lt;rows; i++)</pre></div><p>The variable <code class="literal">i</code> is called the iterator. That's what we use to figure out how many times to loop, and when to<a id="id425" class="indexterm"></a> stop. You don't have to use the letter <code class="literal">i</code>, but you'll see it a lot in other people's code. It's a best practice. And, as we'll see shortly, when you start putting loops inside other loops, you'll actually have to start using other letters, or else your code will break.</p></div>
