Throughout the book, I won't pester you to save your project in every other paragraph—that's up to you and how comfy you feel with your dodgy power cable and the fact that you're reading this book during <a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a>a lightning storm. At the very least, let's learn how to save the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> that we're working on. Save frequency is up to you from this point on!</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>Save Scene As</strong></span>) in the menu. You're asking Unity to save the current named <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, but there really is no named <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> for it to save yet. Let's fix that.</p></li><li><p>In the resulting dialog, type a name for your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. I chose to call mine <code class="literal">Game</code>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button. Unity actually creates a <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel called <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>. You know that it's a <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> because it has a Unity 3D icon next to it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_09.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now that you've named your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, you can quickly save changes at any point by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, or by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Scene</strong></span> in the menu. Clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project</strong></span> will do a blanket save across your entire project.</p></li></ol></div></div>
