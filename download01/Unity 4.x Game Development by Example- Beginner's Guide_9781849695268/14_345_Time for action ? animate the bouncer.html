If you so choose, you can dock it within the interface like the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panels. I prefer not to because I like having a lot of space for this window. I resize the window so that it covers most of the right half of my screen. You can drag the middle line that splits the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> window (dividing the dark and light parts of the window) to give more or less real estate to the key view (dark side).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_14_23.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Press the round reddish-pink <span class="strong"><strong>Record</strong></span> button<a id="id1054" class="indexterm"></a> near the top-left of the window.</p></li><li><p>Unity asks you to name your new <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> clip.<a id="id1055" class="indexterm"></a> Save it as <code class="literal">animBounce</code>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec134"></a>

</h3></div></div></div><p>When you save your Animation clip, two things happen: the clip becomes a tangible, reusable asset in your <a id="id1056" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, and the Record, Play, Pause, and Step buttons all light up red to notify you that you're in animation mode.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_14_24.jpg" /></div><p>Why make such a big, noticeable deal out of it? Because whenever you move your recorded <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span><a id="id1057" class="indexterm"></a> around, Unity is going to remember its position, rotation, and scale in a keyframe. <span class="strong"><strong>Keyframe</strong></span><a id="id1058" class="indexterm"></a> is a term borrowed from classical animation. Animation software packages store the position, rotation, and scale values of objects in keyframes, and use<a id="id1059" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>interpolation</strong></span> to figure out how to animate an object between those keys. In classical animation, this is called <span class="strong"><strong>in-betweening</strong></span>.<a id="id1060" class="indexterm"></a>
</p><p>If you create a keyframe for a GameObject on frame 1 and another on frame 10 where the GameObject has moved across the screen, Unity will interpolate between those two keyframes, filling in the blanks to make the GameObject move from one side of the screen to the other.</p></div></div>
