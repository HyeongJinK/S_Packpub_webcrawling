Audio is so important to games that even crummy little low-rent sounds<a id="id788" class="indexterm"></a> effects (like the ones we're about to add to this game!) can increase the game's awesomeness by a factor of WOW... to the power of GEE GOLLY—something like that.

<span class="strong"><strong>Now hear this</strong></span>
</p><p>You may have noticed that Unity also offers an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> component. What's the deal? Well, in the case of a 3D game, you don't necessarily want the player to hear everything that's going on all the time. You want him to hear audio fading in and out as he moves closer to or farther from the source (the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Source</strong></span>, to be specific). By default, an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> component is attached to the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> in any <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. In something like a first-person perspective game, the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> will only pick up sounds from Audio Source-enabled game objects if it's within range. If we tweak the settings just right, the player won't hear a noisy washing machine GameObject from the other side of the level. Each scene can only have one <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Listener</strong></span> at a time.</p><p>Unity also offers a <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Reverb Zone</strong></span> component. This is a spherical gizmo that lets you define an area where the sound is "pure" and unaffected, with a candy-coated craziness shell around it that lets you define echoes and other potentially oddball effects.</p></div><p>With the <span class="strong"><strong>Bomb</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Stein Prefabs</strong></span> so enabled, we can add a few lines to the <span class="strong"><strong>FallingObject</strong></span> to make them play sounds when they hit the ground.</p></div>
