The last project you had open should appear. (This might be the AngryBots Demo from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>That's One Fancy Hammer!</em></span>).</p></li><li><p>In the menu, click on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Projectâ€¦</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>Project Location</strong></span>, type in or browse to the folder where you want your project created. It's a good idea to create a new folder somewhere on your computer where you'll be able to find it again, and name it something that makes sense. I created a folder on my desktop called <code class="literal">UnityProjects</code>, and created my new project in an empty folder called <code class="literal">Chapter3Game</code>.</p></li><li><p>Unity gives us the option to import a bunch of useful ready-made goodies into our new project. We don't need any of these yet, so make sure all the boxes are unchecked:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/Image1.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Next, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button. Unity will briefly close and restart. After importing the assets we selected, the program will open.</p></li><li><p>Close the <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome to Unity</strong></span> start screen if it's open. You'll find yourself staring face-to-face with that <a id="id142" class="indexterm"></a>wide-open 3D plane.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>Where did everything go?</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're staring at nothing but a 3D plane in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, Unity has pulled a switcheroo on you. To get back to a layout, like the one you saw in the AngryBots Demo, choose <span class="strong"><strong>2 by 3</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> drop-down menu at the top right of the screen. Note that there are other choices here, and that Unity enables you to save and restore your own custom layouts:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_02.jpg" /></div></div></div>
