</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, there's nothing magical about it. Here's what happened when you clicked on that <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button.</p><p>When you import a font into Unity, an entire set of raster images is created for you by the True Type Font Importer. <span class="strong"><strong>Raster images</strong></span><a id="id539" class="indexterm"></a> are the ones that look all pixelly and square when you zoom in on them. Fonts are inherently vector instead of raster, which means that they use math to describe their <a id="id540" class="indexterm"></a>curves and angles. Vector images can be scaled up any size without going all Rubik's Cube on you.</p><p>But, Unity doesn't yet support vector fonts. For every font size that you want to support, you need to import a new version of the font and change its import settings to a different size. This means that you may have <a id="id541" class="indexterm"></a>four copies of, say, the Impact font, at the four different sizes you require.</p><p>When you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button, Unity creates its set of raster images based on the font that you're importing.</p></div></div>
