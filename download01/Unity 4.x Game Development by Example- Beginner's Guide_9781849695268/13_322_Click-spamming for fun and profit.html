Try "click-spamming" the grid to place more Xs than you ought to. If you're very quick, you can fill the <a id="id973" class="indexterm"></a>grid with Xs before the computer places a single O.</p><p>By adding a conditional check to the <code class="literal">ClickSquare</code> function, we can make sure the human can only place a piece when it's his or her turn:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">function ClickSquare(square:GameObject)
{
  if(gameIsOver || currentPlayer == 2) return;</pre></div><p>The double-pipe means "OR". If either of the statements separated by || in the conditional check resolve to true, then the code within the conditional is executed.</p><p>So if the human clicks to place a piece, if either the game is over or it's the computer's turn, we use the return statement to eject out of the function and prevent the rest of the code from executing.</p><p>Test the game again. Now, neither player can cheat.</p></div>
