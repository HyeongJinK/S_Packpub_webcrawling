If you're sidling over from another development tool like Flash, GameMaker Pro, or Unreal Engine, I hope this book has provided you a sampling of the slick pipeline and process that Unity makes possible. A book like this can only ever scratch the surface of such an enormously powerful tool as Unity; if you've enjoyed what you've done with Unity so far, a fantastically supportive community and a deliciously deep development tool await you beyond the back cover of this book.</p></div>
