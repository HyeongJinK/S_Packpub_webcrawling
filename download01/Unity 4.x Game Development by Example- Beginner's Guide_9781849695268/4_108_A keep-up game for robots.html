It's very easy to keep the ball bouncing because there's nothing to send it spinning off in any crazy directions. At least in <span class="strong"><strong>Breakout</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Arkanoid</strong></span>, you had interesting angles to work with. Our game doesn't have any walls to angle off, but we do have that paddle.</p><p>What if we angled the paddle as the player moved it around? An angled paddle<a id="id335" class="indexterm"></a> would make the ball bounce in different directions and keep the player on her toes.</p></div>
