<span class="emphasis"><em>We've reached the precipice: we're staring at a game that doesn't do much and <span class="strong"><strong>won't</strong></span> do much more unless we write some code. If you're brand new to this stuff, code is scary—or, rather, the <span class="strong"><strong>idea</strong></span> of code is scary. Will you have to type a bunch of ones and zeroes or cryptic punctuation along thousands of monotonous line numbers? If you've ever tried developing a game or if you've ever been taught to program using some ancient language in a high school computer course, code might have been the thing to undo you. But, here you are giving it one more crack at the bat. The world <span class="emphasis"><em>needs</em></span> a three-dimensional keep-up game, by gum! It's time to show the world what you're made of.</em></span>
