An important skill of a computer programmer is to describe nonvisual things, like thought, in concrete steps that a computer can easily digest. But first you, as a human, have to properly digest them!</p><p>By using the example of a fairly simple game like Tic Tac Toe, you've walked half a block in the shoes of the computer scientists who programmed a computer to defeat the world's best chess player at his, and humankind's, own game.</p><p>In this chapter, you:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Learned to break a strategy game down into its core elements</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Explored game trees, and how they can be used to map out all of the branching positions possible in a strategy game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Prioritized a list of strategic options to create a preferred plan of attack.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Used the <code class="literal">||</code> (or) operator to build more sophisticated conditional statements</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Discovered how to create the illusion of thought by adding pauses in the computer's actions, and by choosing randomly from a list of preferred moves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Taught a computer to simulate mistakes by testing against a random number</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec133"></a>More hospitality</h3></div></div></div><p>The last chapter is nigh! In our final hurrah, we'll leverage our dual-camera technique from <span class="strong"><strong>Shoot the Moon</strong></span> to add environmental ambience to the <span class="strong"><strong>Ticker Taker</strong></span> game. Then we'll explore the animation tools, and learn how to publish our games so that anyone can play them.</p></div></div>
