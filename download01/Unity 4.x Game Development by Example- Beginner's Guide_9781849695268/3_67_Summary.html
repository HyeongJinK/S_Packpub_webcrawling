</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Customize <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span> components to make <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> become bouncy</p></li></ul></div><p>We took an impossibly complex game idea and hacked it down to its fun, naked essentials. We explored the origin pointâ€”the center of our game's universe. We learned about the building blocks of 3D construction: vertices, edges, and faces. We talked about how polygon counts can affect game performance. We laughed, we cried. It was profound.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec43"></a>Following the script</h3></div></div></div><p>What we have so far is not a game, but a very dull movie about the best keep-up player in the world who never, ever drops the ball. One key thing that distinguishes movies from games is popcorn. Also, games are interactive. We need to introduce interactivity to our game so that the player can move that paddle around.</p><p>We do this by writing a <span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span>. Just like in the movies where everyone follows a list of stage cues, lines, and notes to put the finished product together, <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in Unity can follow scripts to determine what to do. Scripts are essentially lists of instructions for people, or <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span>, to follow. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to add scripts to our <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> to add interactivity to our game.</p></div></div>
