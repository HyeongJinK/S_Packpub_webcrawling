Any developer can submit a game to Kongregate, and once the game is live, the Kongregate community can play, rate, and comment on it. If you're a first-time developer, that may sound a little scary. And if you're a veteran developer, you know <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> how scary it is!
