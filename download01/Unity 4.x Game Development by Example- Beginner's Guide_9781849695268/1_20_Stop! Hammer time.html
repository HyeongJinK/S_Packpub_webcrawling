</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>These paths may change depending on which version of Unity you've downloaded. As the Unity Technologies team improves the software, they launch new and more impressive demos to show off what Unity can do. If you're reading this book, and your copy of Unity 3D launches a different demo project, or if the Angry Bots Demo is no longer available by the time you begin reading this book, don't freak out! Everything we're about to discuss can be generally applied to most demos.</p></div><p>When the <a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a>Angry Bots Demo first opens, you may see a splash screen referring you to different tutorial resources and language guides. How helpful! Now close it (don't worry, it'll be there next time, unless you uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Show at Startup</strong></span> box). If you checked the box but you'd really like to see that welcome screen again, look in the menus under <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome Screen</strong></span>. In the menus, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Layouts</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>2 by 3</strong></span> to see the different panels that we're about to tour.</p><p>After the panels have repositioned themselves, look for the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. It should be one of the three vertically oriented panels on the right half of your screen. At the top right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel is a very small button that looks like a downward-facing triangle next to three horizontal lines. Click there, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>One Column Layout</strong></span> from the resulting context menu. This will get an annoying split view out of your way:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_19.jpg" /></div><p>If you don't see all the fancy highfalutin' 3D jazz going on in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> windows, you may just need to load the main game scene. To do this, find the Scene called <span class="strong"><strong>AngryBots</strong></span> at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel (it has a black-and-white Unity icon next to it), and double-click it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_20.jpg" /></div><p>To try out the<a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a> demo, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button at the top center of the screen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_07.jpg" /></div><p>You can walk around the Angry Bots Demo using the <span class="emphasis"><em>WASD</em></span> keys on your keyboard. Hold down the left-mouse button to fire your boomstick at the aggravated automatons. When you're finished <span class="strong"><strong>exploring</strong></span>, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Esc</em></span> key to pause the game and regain mouse control. Then click on the Play button again to end the demo:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_31.jpg" /></div></div></div>
