When you're working on your game, it may help to ascribe real-world measurements<a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a> to these units. Perhaps one unit equals one foot or one meter? If you're building a real-time strategy game where the scale is much larger, maybe one unit equals one mile or one kilometer? The ball that we've just created is a little large for our purposes, so let's shrink it down:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> still selected, type <code class="literal">0.4</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> scale values in the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component of the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> to move the cursor to each new field, and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> after typing in each field to commit the change:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_08.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> should shrink down to 0.4, or 40 percent of its original size. Note that if you enter 0.4 only into one or two of the three <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> fields, you'll accidentally create a weird-looking egg or an ovoid-shaped ball.<a id="id170" class="indexterm"></a> If you dig gizmos, you can also use Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> gizmo which, as we've seen, is mapped to the <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> key. Click and drag the grey box in the middle of the gizmo to scale the ball uniformly.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Size matters</strong></span>
</p><p>When it comes to including <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in Unity's physics simulation, as we'll do by the end of this chapter, scale does actually matter. The Unity manual recommends that you treat 1 unit as 1 real-world meter (that's 3.2 feet, for you imperial users).</p></div></div>
