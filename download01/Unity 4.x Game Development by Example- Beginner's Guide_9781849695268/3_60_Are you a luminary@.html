On many 3D animated movies and teevee shows, as well as on large game development teams, there's often at least one person dedicated to lighting the scene, just as there are lighting specialists on real-world film sets. Virtual lights are built to mimic the properties of real-world lights. Lighting, like modeling, can be an entirely unique discipline in the world of 3D game development.</p><p>When you're finished exploring lights, follow the steps mentioned previously in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action â€“ move and rotate the light</em></span> section to restore your directional light, or just press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> on the keyboard to undo everything back to when you started messing around.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec39"></a>Who turned out the lights?</h3></div></div></div><p>When you light a scene with multiple lights, it can be tricky to see which light is affecting which area. To turn a light off, <a id="id211" class="indexterm"></a>select the light in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. Then, uncheck the checkbox at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. Poof! The light is gone; but not forgotten. Check the checkbox again to make it reappear.</p><p>In fact, you can turn any <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> on and off by using this checkbox. It's a handy way to isolate things in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> without deleting your hard work.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_24.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec40"></a>Darkness reigns</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're working on a particularly grim game and you want to be able to see what's going on in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, toggle<a id="id212" class="indexterm"></a> the internal lighting by pressing the sunny little button at the top of your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view.
