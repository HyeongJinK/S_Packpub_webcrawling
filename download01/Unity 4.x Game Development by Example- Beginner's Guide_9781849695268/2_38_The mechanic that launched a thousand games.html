The innovation here is to turn Pong into a single-player game like real-world handball or squash, with the addition of a breakable brick wall. Breakout introduces stages or levels to the Pong concept, each with a different configuration of bricks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_02_21.jpg" /></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Arkanoid</strong></span><a id="id131" class="indexterm"></a> iterates on Breakout by changing the skin to a sci-fi theme. The paddle becomes a spaceship. Arkanoid adds a few new features, most importantly power-ups that come in the form of capsules that are released when the ball smashes into the bricks. When the player catches the capsules with the spaceship, the game rules get bent. The spaceship can become longer. It can become sticky so that the player can catch the ball and plan the next shot. My favorite Arkanoid power-up is the red capsule marked <span class="strong"><strong>L</strong></span>; it enables the spaceship to fire laser beams to destroy the bricks!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_02_22.jpg" /></div><p>The Pong legacy brings us all the way to the present day, with <span class="strong"><strong>Peggle</strong></span><a id="id132" class="indexterm"></a> by <a id="id133" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>PopCap Games</strong></span>. Peggle combines a few different game mechanics: the brick-smashing and ball-bouncing of Breakout, the angular aiming of <a id="id134" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bust-A-Move</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Puzzle Bobble</strong></span>, and the random insanity of real-world pachinko games. To jazz up the skin, PopCap adds cartoon unicorns and gophers, and in one of the most-talked-about payoffs in video game history, Peggle rewards players with an absolutely over-the-top slow-motion winning shot while blaring the climax of Beethoven's ninth symphony!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_02_23.jpg" /></div><p>Peggle<a id="id135" class="indexterm"></a> teaches us some important lessons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A few small twists on a timeless mechanic will still sell.

The famed MMORPG <span class="strong"><strong>World of Warcraft</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WoW</strong></span>) is embedded with a special version of Peggle, along with another blockbuster PopCap Games hit, <span class="strong"><strong>Bejewelled</strong></span>.
