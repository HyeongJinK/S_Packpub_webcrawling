The <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> is poised in midair, ready to fall.<a id="id215" class="indexterm"></a> Everything looks good. Let's test our game to see what happens next:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on the Play button to test your game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_31.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Ack! That was anti-climactic. The <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> is just sort of sitting there, waiting to fall, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> is not moving. Somewhere in the distance, a slow, sad strain of violin music plays.</p><p>But not to worry! We're one step away from making something amazing happen. Press the Play button again to stop testing the game.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The pitfalls of Play</strong></span>
</p><p>Remember that when you're testing your game with the Play button activated, you can still make changes to your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, but these changes don't get saved! When you stop testing, everything will go back to the way it once was, like Cinderella after the royal ball. To make it very clear that you're in this potentially confusing game-testing mode, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Maximize on Play</strong></span> button at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> window. Now, whenever you test your game, the window will fill the screen<a id="id216" class="indexterm"></a> to prevent you from absentmindedly messing with stuff.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_32.jpg" /></div></div></div>
