<span class="strong"><strong>Custom colliders</strong></span>
</p><p>You may have guessed that we could have used the <span class="strong"><strong>HeroShip's</strong></span> own mesh in its <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span>. The trouble with that plan is that the <span class="strong"><strong>HeroShip</strong></span> mesh is too complex. If you're making a game where you're trying to squeeze every last ounce of performance out of Unity, you might consider modeling a separate, simpler mesh to use as the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span> for your spaceship—one that roughly approximates the ship's shape, but with less detail, which is what we've done here. Unity can chew through its calculations faster if you use optimized mesh colliders. If you want Unity to turn your <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span> into a convex <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span>, like we did with the hands and tray models in <span class="strong"><strong>Ticker Taker</strong></span>, the mesh has to have fewer than 256 triangles. You'll recall that convex mesh colliders give us better results when testing collisions between moving objects. An unoptimized mesh, like a poorly constructed wall, can actually let other colliders pass right through it, which is called "tunneling". Be sure to optimize your <a id="id840" class="indexterm"></a>collider meshes to prevent tunneling. Thin, flimsy colliders are good candidates for unwanted tunneling.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_11_11.jpg" /></div></div>
