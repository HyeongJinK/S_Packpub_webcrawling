That speeds up Unity's calculations, because the software doesn't have to worry about sorting through different types of things in the Collection.</p><p>Imagine if you brought home a bucket of mystery fried chicken, but were warned that it also contained a tennis shoe, a wrench, 175 ball bearings, and a well-worn copy of Big Al's Bathroom Reader. It would take you longer to sort out what was chicken and what was scrap metal than if it was 100% chicken, and consequently, you wouldn't be able to eat your way through the bucket quite as quickly. (Of course, if you made any dire mistakes, that Bathroom Reader would probably come in handy.)</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Typing</em></span> the array (giving it a <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span>) also speeds you up as a programmer, because when you pull things out of a mystery bucket of fried chicken, you constantly have to tell Unity, "this is a shoe. This is fried chicken. This is a ball bearing," using a technique called <span class="strong"><strong>casting</strong></span> via the <code class="literal">as</code> keyword:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var friedChicken:FriedChicken = aMysteryBucket[0] as FriedChicken;
// This is definitely not a shoe, Unity.
// Using the 'as' keyword, I'm explicitly telling you that what I've // just pulled out of the bucket is absolutely a piece of fried chicken.</pre></div></div>
