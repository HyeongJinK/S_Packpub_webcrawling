It has these lists:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Variables</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Messages sent</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Inherited variables</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Inherited functions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Inherited class functions</p></li></ul></div><p>From that list, the only familiar word might be "functions", which we just learned are reusable bundles of code (or endlessly eatable sandwiches, if you prefer). As we write more code in this<a id="id285" class="indexterm"></a> chapter, we'll come to understand what variables are. For now, focus on the things listed under the <span class="strong"><strong>Variables</strong></span> section.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_10.jpg" /></div><p>One of the variables is called <code class="literal">enabled</code>.<a id="id286" class="indexterm"></a> Do you remember when you wrote <code class="literal">renderer.enabled = false;</code>? You've already used a variable, perhaps without knowing it. And, check it out—some of the other things that we noticed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component are listed here. There are variables called <code class="literal">castShadows</code> and <code class="literal">receiveShadows</code>, which we saw as checkboxes in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. There are also some material-related variables. At the bottom of the list, there's a variable called <code class="literal">isVisible</code>, which appears to do something different compared to the <code class="literal">enabled</code> variable.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Downloading the example code</strong></span>
</p><p>You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com" target="_blank">http://www.packtpub.com</a>. If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/support" target="_blank">http://www.packtpub.com/support</a> and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you. Each project in the book is intended to be built from the "ground up", beginning with an new project file. The downloadable .unitypackage files for this book contain the assets (sounds, images, and models) you need to build the projects. You may also download completed, working versions of each project for your reference, though these are not intended to be your "first stop" – they're more like the answer sheet at the back of a text book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec46"></a>Have a go hero – pulling the wings off of flies</h3></div></div></div><p>If you were the type of kid who disassembled your parents' clock radio, or got up close and personal with the insects in your backyard to see what made them tick, this is your time to shine. The Script Reference is your gateway to every special reserved word ("keyword") in the Unity language. Try clicking on the <code class="literal">enabled</code> variable in that list. The resulting page not only repeats the explanation of the variable, but it also provides an example of how you might use that variable in code. You can even use the drop-down lists on the right to see the C# and Boo translations. (Go ahead—check them out! Fortune favors the bold).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_11.jpg" /></div><p>If you're wired a certain way, you've already thrown this book down and are eagerly scouring the Script Reference looking for code you can mess around with. That's okay. We'll be here when you get back. If you are still a little wary of this foreign language and would like a little more guidance using it, read on.</p></div></div>
