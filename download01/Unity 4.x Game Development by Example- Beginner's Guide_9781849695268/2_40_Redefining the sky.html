But through this chapter, we've seen that that endless sky can actually trap us into an ambitious concept that we'll have no chance of completing. So, let's redefine the sky. Instead of wondering how big and complex your game can be, think about the endless array of simple interactions and moments of joy our world contains. Throwing and catching a ball, knocking a pile of stuff over, feeding an animal, growing a plant—the world is packed with simple, effective interactions that ignite our most primitive, most basic "Joy Cortices", which is a neurological term that I've entirely invented just now.</p><p>If you want to discover one of these joy-producing real-world moments, study a child. Because games are all about playing, the simple things that amuse and delight children and babies are the stuff of award-winning games. What is <span class="strong"><strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong></span> if not a complex game of hide and seek? <span class="strong"><strong>Rock Band</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Guitar Hero</strong></span> are digital versions of all those times you played<a id="id139" class="indexterm"></a> air guitar and pretended to be a rock star in front of the mirror with your bedroom door closed. Have you ever rolled snow into giant balls to build a snowman? <span class="strong"><strong>Katamari Damacy</strong></span> is the video game expression of that joy-producing activity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_02_24.jpg" /></div><p>Creative<a id="id140" class="indexterm"></a> limitation is not something to rebel against—it's something to be embraced! It's when we're under restriction that we come up with the most creative and interesting solutions to problems. Conversely, when we have absolutely no limitations, we're at risk of producing junk. This is a common criticism leveled at George Lucas for creating his vastly inferior <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> prequels; so the theory goes, no one dared to tell George "no", and the horrifying result was Jar Jar Binks.</p><p>It's even possible that in the midst of your limitations, you'll stumble upon a game bug or a strange behavior that's so fun and interesting, it becomes your core gameplay mechanic! In the world of video games, anything is possible.</p></div>
