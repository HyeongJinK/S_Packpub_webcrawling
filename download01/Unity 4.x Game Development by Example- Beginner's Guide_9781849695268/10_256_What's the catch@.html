Likewise, you want to enable the <span class="strong"><strong>explosion1</strong></span> sound effect if the player gets hit by a bomb. If you can't figure it out on your own, take a deep breath, and then go nag someone else to figure it out for you. That's called <a id="id801" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>delegating</strong></span>, and it's a perfectly legit way to develop a game.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip50"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Perfect for smashing</strong></span>
</p><p>Unity has all kinds of complex sound controls for playing music and other effects. The <code class="literal">audio.PlayOneShot</code> command is perfect for collision sound effects. If you'd like to learn more about adding sounds and music to your game, look up <span class="strong"><strong>AudioSource</strong></span> class, <span class="strong"><strong>AudioListener</strong></span> class, and <span class="strong"><strong>AudioClip</strong></span> class in the Unity Script Reference.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Lo-fi, high fun</strong></span>
</p><p>The sound effects that we're using for our game were created with a freeware sound effects generator called <span class="strong"><strong>BFXR</strong></span>.<a id="id802" class="indexterm"></a> The sounds are all free to use and adorable, hearkening back to a time when dragons looked like ducks and heroes had big white 4-pixel squares for heads. Download a copy of BFXR to generate your own temporary (or even final) game audio. Look for a download link for BFXR and scads of other helpful resources in the <a class="link" href="#" linkend="appA">Appendix</a> at the back of this book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec104"></a>Have a go hero – sound off</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're <a id="id803" class="indexterm"></a>not a big fan of the retro sounds, it's possible that you may<a id="id804" class="indexterm"></a> have missed out on the cavalcade of cheese we now know<a id="id805" class="indexterm"></a> as the 1980s. Feel free to create and <a id="id806" class="indexterm"></a>import your own sound effects for the game. There are a few different ways you can go about this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Get busy with a microphone and record your own effects. This is the only way you can truly be happy with the results and get exactly what's in your head into the game. The industry term for sound effect scores is called "foley". You could use the method acting approach and actually smash glass and detonate high-powered explosives next to your computer (not recommended), or you could say "boom!" and "smash!" into the microphone. It's a style thing.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There are a number of companies that sell royalty-free sound effects for film, television, and movies. I'll give you two warnings about using these—the first is that royalty-free sound effects collections can be very expensive on a hobbyist's budget. The second is that once you get enough experience with these popular collections under your belt, movies and teevee shows will be forever ruined for you. You'll hear these same sound effects everywhere! It's tough to stay immersed in a tense film when all you're thinking is "Hey, that's track #58 from disc 2 of the Explosive Ballistics Collection."</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There <a id="id807" class="indexterm"></a>are less expensive royalty-free sound effects <a id="id808" class="indexterm"></a>websites online, but I've found that a good <a id="id809" class="indexterm"></a>number of them contain <a id="id810" class="indexterm"></a>pirated sound effects from pricy collections that are passed off as legit effects. <span class="emphasis"><em>Caveat emptor</em></span>, which is Latin for "You probably won't get sued, but do the right thing anyway."</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
