<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch03lvl1sec58"></a>Origin story</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The center of your game world is called the <span class="strong"><strong>origin</strong></span>.<a id="id164" class="indexterm"></a> The origin is the magical place in 3D space where everything begins. 3D space is divided into three axes: <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>. If you remember your Cartesian grid from grade school, or if you've ever seen a bar or line graph, the X-axis runs one way (usually horizontally), and the Y-axis runs perpendicular to it (usually vertically). <a id="id165" class="indexterm"></a>3D is like taking a second piece of paper and sticking it at a right angle to your graph so that this axis is perpendicular to both X and Y-axis and you have a third axis firing straight up at your face from your desk, and down into the floor in the opposite direction.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_29.jpg" /></div><p>The orientation (the way the X, Y, and Z axes are positioned) varies from program to program. Unity has a Y-up orientation. The X and Z axes run perpendicular to each other on the "floor". If you hold your arms out like a scarecrow, your arms are the X axis, and the Z axis runs through your belly button. The Y axis runs straight up into the sky, and straight down to the center of the Earth where there are probably goblins or some such creatures.</p><p>Let's get a better look at that ball.<a id="id166" class="indexterm"></a> To orbit around the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, hold down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> key or <span class="emphasis"><em>option</em></span> key on your keyboard (depending on whether you're using a PC or a Mac) and press and hold the primary (usually left) mouse button. If the ball is centered near the origin, you should notice that the "ground" plane slices right through it. That's because the ball's transform ("registration" or "pivot point" in other software) is at its center. Half the ball is above ground, half the ball is below. If the ball's X, Y, and Z position values are all zero, the center of the ball is at the origin, where the three 3D planes converge. It's entirely likely that your ball is floating around somewhere else in the scene. Let's fix that right now.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Disoriented?</strong></span>
</p><p>If you ever get lost orbiting, panning, and zooming around the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, remember that you can reorient yourself by clicking on the gizmo at the top-right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. Click on the green <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> cone to view the scene from the Top-down. Click the red <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> cone to view the scene from the Right. Clicking on the blue <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> cone focuses us at the Front of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. Click the gray box in the middle of the gizmo to return to a perspective view. If you want to completely reverse your view, you can click on the white cone sitting opposite to your orientationâ€”doing this will flip the view around so that you're looking at things from the opposite angle. The label beneath the cone tells you which view you're currently using.</p></div><p>Remember, you can always<a id="id167" class="indexterm"></a> use the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key to frame (or focus) the selected game object.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_03_06.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"></a>XYZ/RGB</h3></div></div></div><p>If you've ever listened to your science or art teacher drone on about color spectrum of light, you might have noticed that X, Y, and Z map onto Red, Green, and Blue. Red, Green, and Blue are the primary colors of light, and are always listed in that order. If you're visually-oriented, it might help you to know that X is Red, Y is Green, and Z is Blue, when you're looking at any depiction of axes in Unity. Most often, your selected axis turns yellow when you hover over or select it.</p></div></div>
