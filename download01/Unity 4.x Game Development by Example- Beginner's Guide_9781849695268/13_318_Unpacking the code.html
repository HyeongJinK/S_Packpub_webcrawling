For example, if the <code class="literal">aEmptySquares</code> array has 5 squares in it, we'll get a number between 0 and 4.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> square = aEmptySquares[someRandomIndex];</pre></div><p>Retrieve a square from the <code class="literal">aEmptySquares</code> array at the index point we randomly chose. For example, if the randomly chosen number between 0 and 5 was 2, then retrieve the element at index 2 of the <code class="literal">aEmptySquares</code> array.</p><p>The line we actually used in our script is just those two lines above, condensed into a single line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> square = aEmptySquares[Random.Range(0,aEmptySquares.Count)];</pre></div><p>Why go through all<a id="id962" class="indexterm"></a> this trouble to compose a list of empty squares, and then randomly choose one from the list? Why don't we just stop at the first empty square we find, and play the computer's piece there?</p><p>This is the first lesson in artificial intelligence: <span class="emphasis"><em>randomness creates the illusion of thought</em></span>.</p><p>Let's say the Squares are listed in the array in order, and the first square in the array is the top-left square. If we always stop our search at the first empty square we find, then the computer will always play its piece in the top-left square (unless player 1 takes that square, and then the computer will always play its piece in the next square in the array).</p><p>If you were playing Tic Tac Toe against someone who always, always placed his or her piece in the same squares, and in always in the same order, would you consider that player intelligent? No! You would probably start looking around for a helmet and gloves to prevent your opponent from hurting himself.</p><p>By having the computer choose a random square, we can improve the illusion that the computer is "thinking". But as you'll soon see, that illusion breaks down pretty quickly.</p></div>
