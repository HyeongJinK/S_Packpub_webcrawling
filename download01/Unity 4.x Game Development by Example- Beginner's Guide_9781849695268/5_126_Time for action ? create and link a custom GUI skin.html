If you've ever worked with <span class="strong"><strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSS</strong></span>), you'll have a better idea of what's going on here. CSS<a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a> enables you to define the way a website looks; how the images are displayed, the font and size of the text, and the spacing of elements. All of the website's pages use that stylesheet to display their elements the same way. So you've got the thing, and then you've got the way the thing looks. It's like putting a costume on a kid at a birthday party. You can make the kid look like a pirate, a princess, a superhero, or a giant walking cupcake, but the foundation of the kid doesn't change. It's still little Billy under that foam cupcake suit. Two different websites can have the exact same content, but their stylesheets could make them appear radically different.</p><p>When you custom style your UI, you create a new "costume" for it. You can apply different costumes to the GUI, but the bones stay the same. You still have the same number of buttons at the same size and in the same position on the screen. Those buttons and controls all behave the same way as they did before—they're just wearing a different costume.</p><p>Let's take the first few steps towards setting<a id="id386" class="indexterm"></a> up our game to use a <a id="id387" class="indexterm"></a>custom UI—a different costume (or "skin") for our controls:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Double-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>TitleGUI</strong></span> script in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> Panel to open the default script editor, <span class="strong"><strong>MonoDevelop</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>At the top of the script, create a member variable to hold your custom GUI skin:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

Notice that the <code class="literal">customSkin</code> variable that we just created in code is now listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>TitleGUI</strong></span> script component!
