<span class="strong"><strong>Math will divide us</strong></span>
</p><p>Computers are faster at multiplication than they are at division. If you are a stickler for speed, you can amp up this code by multiplying the values by 0.5 instead of dividing them by 2.</p><p>By declaring and defining these variables at the top of the script, any of our script's functions can refer to them. They'll also show up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, where we can fiddle with their values without having to open a script editor.</p></div><p>So, what we're doing here is putting the button halfway across the screen. Because the button builds out from its top-left corner, we're bumping it back by half its own width to make sure it's perfectly centered. The only other thing we're doing here is placing the button at 460 pixels down the screen along the y axis. This puts the button just beneath the title work.</p><p>Here's what your complete code should look like:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var customSkin:GUISkin;

// button width:
var buttonW:int = 100;
// button height:
var buttonH:int = 50;

// half of the Screen width:
var halfScreenW:float;
// half of the button width:
var halfButtonW:float;

function Start()
{
  halfScreenW = Screen.width/2;
  halfButtonW = buttonW/2;
}
function OnGUI () {
  GUI.skin = customSkin;
  print("screenW = " + Screen.width);
  print("halfScreenW = " + halfScreenW);
  if(GUI.Button(Rect(halfScreenW-halfButtonW, 460, buttonW, buttonH), "Play Game"))
  {
    print("You clicked me!");
  }
