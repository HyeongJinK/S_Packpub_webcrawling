If you think, "I'd like to create a space-themed strategy game," and you think back to all of the space-themed strategy games that you've played, you might think of 4X games like <span class="strong"><strong>Alpha Centauri</strong></span><a id="id97" class="indexterm"></a> or <a id="id98" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Master of Orion</strong></span>—they both pit you in a massive quest to conquer the universe. They are <span class="emphasis"><em>huge</em></span> games that you likely won't finish alone. So, you start trimming them down for sanity's sake—"I'll just build Master of Orion with fewer planets," or "I'll just build Alpha Centauri with fewer features". Now you've unwittingly fallen into that self-defeating trap. Your project is still too huge. You eventually abandon all hope. A few years later, you're an accountant wondering what might have been.</p></div>
