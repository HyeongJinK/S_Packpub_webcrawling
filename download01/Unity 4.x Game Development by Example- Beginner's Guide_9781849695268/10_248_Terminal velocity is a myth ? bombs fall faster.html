One solution is to declare a variable called <code class="literal">speed</code> at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>FallingObject</strong></span> script.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var speed:int;</pre></div><p>Change the following line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">transform.position.y -= 50 * Time.deltaTime;</pre></div><p>to:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">transform.position.y -= speed * Time.deltaTime;</pre></div><p>Then for each object—the bomb and stein Prefabs—input a different number for the speed value in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. Try 30 for the stein and 50 for the bomb. Two objects, one <a id="id774" class="indexterm"></a>script, and two different speeds. Awesome? Confirmed: awesome.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip48"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Know when to double down</strong></span>
</p><p>At some point, objects become different enough that sharing a script is no longer saving you time and effort, it's causing you grief. As a game developer, you need to decide what sort of structure best suits your game-creating goal. Programmers have all kinds of tricks to save themselves work and to logically structure their code. The object-oriented programming pillar called inheritance (which we've looked at briefly) is another way to get two objects to share code, while ensuring that they function as two different things.</p><p>

</p><p>When it comes down to just getting your game finished and playable, don't ever feel foolish about making mistakes and writing your game the wrong way. A great rule, especially when you're starting out, is to get the game working first, and then go back to make the code elegant. Totally a fact—tuning up your code and making it as organized and pretty as possible is called refactoring. When you're just starting out, worry more about functional code than elegant code.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec101"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened – when game objects collide?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>Bombs plummet from the top floor of the apartment building and explode around our character, as his beloved beer steins shatter on the pavement with every step he takes. These are the origins of a competent catch game! Now, let's worry about what happens when the player catches a stein or comes in contact with a bomb.</p><p>There are a few different ways we can go about this. We can write the collision detection code into the <span class="strong"><strong>FallingObject Script</strong></span>, but that might get complicated. We're using the same script for both objects, and the objects need to do different things when they hit the player. It makes more sense to me to put the collision detection on the player character. We'll check to see when he gets hit by something, and then based on what hits him, he'll react in different <a id="id775" class="indexterm"></a>ways.</p></div></div>
