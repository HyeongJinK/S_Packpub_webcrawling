<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec152"></a>To nest is best</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The structure that we've <a id="id431" class="indexterm"></a>set up is called a<a id="id432" class="indexterm"></a> "nested loop" because we have one iterative loop running inside another.</p><p>Inside the second loop, we're using <code class="literal">j</code> as the iterator because <code class="literal">i</code> is already in use. We're using the <code class="literal">new</code> keyword to create a new instance of the <code class="literal">Card</code> class, and we're adding it to the array at index <code class="literal">aGrid[i,j]</code>.</p><p>Talk it through and it's not too tricky to understand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The first time through the outside loop, we're at index <code class="literal">0</code> of our 2D Array.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Then in the inner loop, we loop four times. Each time, we stuff a new card into the 2D Array called <code class="literal">aGrid</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Next, we do the main loop again. The outer index value <code class="literal">i</code> increases to 1.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>On to the inner loop, we cram four new cards into the empty. Now, <code class="literal">aGrid</code> contains 8 cards.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>We keep going until this whole thing plays out. At the end of the nested loop, <code class="literal">aGrid</code> is an array containing four arrays, and each of those arrays has four cards in it, for a total of 16 cards.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_05_28.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>The reason why 2D<a id="id433" class="indexterm"></a> Arrays are so handy is that we can easily access stuff inside them using grid coordinates, just like in that old board game Battleship. If we want to talk about the card three slots over and one slot down, we call it using <code class="literal">aGrid[1,2]</code>. In fact, if we were building a digital version of Battleship, we might use nested loops to build 2D arrays to build that game as well.</p><p>Note that arrays are zero based. The card at <code class="literal">aGrid[0,0]</code> is the card at the top-left of the grid. Next to that is the card in <code class="literal">aGrid[0,1]</code>. Next to that is the card in <code class="literal">aGrid[0,2]</code>. To get the card one row down, we increase the first index: <code class="literal">aGrid[1,2]</code>. Here's what you should try picturing in your head:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_05_29.jpg" /></div><p>Hopefully, you're <a id="id434" class="indexterm"></a>already seeing how a grid like this relates to a grid of cards laid out on the table for a Memory game. If not, take it on faith and keep reading! It should become clearer as we go.</p></div>
