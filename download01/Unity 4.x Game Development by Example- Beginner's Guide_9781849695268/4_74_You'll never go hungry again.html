It's like having a sandwich that you can eat as many times as you want. We use<a id="id264" class="indexterm"></a> functions to organize our code, and to house lines of code that we may need more than once.</p><p>The function we used is called <code class="literal">Update</code>. <a id="id265" class="indexterm"></a>Just as there's an ongoing physics process in the background of our game that we can tap into to make our ball move and bounce, there's an ongoing <code class="literal">Update</code> loop as well. <code class="literal">Update</code> is eaten (or called) again and again and again while our game runs. Any Script lines, or statements, that we put inside the <code class="literal">Update</code> function tap into that loop.</p><p>Notice the way the <code class="literal">Update</code> function is declared.<a id="id266" class="indexterm"></a> On a restaurant menu, we might declare that our Street-Fightin' Hoagie is a scrumptious offering of mile-high pastrami with lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, and cucumbers, topped with a fried egg, and slathered with mustard. We can declare a function much more simply. It starts with the word <code class="literal">function</code>, and adds the function name and a pair of round brackets. If our hoagie was a JavaScript function, it might look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">function Hoagie() {
}</pre></div><p>Certain functions, like <a id="id267" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code>, are special functions that are inherent to Unity. At the time of writing, Unity 3D does not have a built-in <code class="literal">Hoagie()</code> function, <a id="id268" class="indexterm"></a>which means it's a <span class="emphasis"><em>custom</em></span> function.</p></div>
