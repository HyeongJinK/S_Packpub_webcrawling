The language is searchable to the tiniest detail, but if you don't know Unity's particular word for something, you'll still be lost. It's like not knowing how to spell a certain word. You can look it up in a dictionary, but if you don't know how to spell it, you might have<a id="id287" class="indexterm"></a> trouble looking it up!</p><p>If you can't find what you're looking for, your best plan of attack is to bust out the synonyms. Try typing in any word you can think of that's related to what you want to do. If you want to hide or show something, try searching words like visible, visibility, visual, see, show, appearance, draw, render, hide, disappear, and vanish! Even if it's a long shot, try "POOF!" You never know. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_27.jpg" /></div><p>If you've exhausted your vocabulary and you still come up short, you can randomly click on words in the documentation and read about what they do. Another approach is to start scouring the Internet for Unity tutorials. Many developers like to share their code to help beginners like you learn new things. You might not understand what all this code does, but in grazing through it, you could<a id="id288" class="indexterm"></a> find a line of code that looks like it might do what you're trying to do. Copy it, paste it into your own Script, and start playing around. If it breaks your game, then good! You might think that you're not learning anything, but you are: you're learning how to <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> break your game. One final resource is chat channels, which you can find by using an Internet Relay Chat client, but as a Unity n00b (new user), you have to be careful and respectful of the way you speak to real people who know far more than you do. In most chat channels, there's very little love for new users who don't exhaust existing online resources before asking a question.</p><p>Be sure to also check the <a class="link" href="#" linkend="appA">Appendix</a> at the back of this book for a great list of Unity resources.</p></div>
