Your game's mechanic is how it physically functions. The very best games contain a simple mechanic that's easy to learn, hard to master, and compelling enough to keep a player interested. The mechanic in <span class="strong"><strong>Tetris</strong></span><a id="id94" class="indexterm"></a> is to move and rotate falling blocks into place to create and eliminate one or more solid lines. The mechanic in many golf games is to simulate swinging a golf club by moving the controller's thumbstick around or tapping a button when the "Power" and "Accuracy" meters are at the right level. The mechanic in <span class="strong"><strong>Breakout</strong></span> is to move a paddle back and forth to bounce a ball into a wall of fragile bricks.</p><p>A game's <span class="strong"><strong>skin</strong></span> is how<a id="id95" class="indexterm"></a> it looks and sounds. It's the animated cutscenes that<a id="id96" class="indexterm"></a> establish a story. It's the theme that you choose for your game. Imagine a game where you've programmed an object to follow the mouse cursor. There are "bad" objects on the screen that you must avoid, and "good" objects on the screen that you must collect. That's the game mechanic. The game skin could be practically anything. The player object could be a mouse collecting "good" cheese objects and avoiding "bad" rat objects. Or it could be a spaceship collecting space gold and avoiding black holes. Or it could be a fountain pen collecting verbs and avoiding conjunctive pronouns. As they say, "the sky's the limit!"</p></div>
