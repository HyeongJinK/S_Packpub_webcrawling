Understanding how to build a game clock will serve you well in nearly all of the games you venture off to build. Games without some kind of clock or timer are uncommon, so adding this notch to your game developer tool belt is a real victory. Here are some skills you learned in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a font material</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Displaying values on-screen with <span class="strong"><strong>GUIText</strong></span>

Let's return home like the mighty conquerors we are, and jazz it up with some of the new things we've learned. Then, we'll go even further, and start incorporating 3D models built in an actual 3D art package into our game <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes</strong></span>.</p></div>
