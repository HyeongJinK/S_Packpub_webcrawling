An error is a written notice that Unity sends you when something you typed doesn't work or doesn't make sense.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>You can press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key to drop the top sandwich bun down a line. Some programmers (like me) prefer writing code this way so that they can see the open or closed sandwich buns lined up, but other programmers prefer code that doesn't spread out too much.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_100_new.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>In this book, we'll use<a id="id270" class="indexterm"></a> both approaches just to keep you on your toes.</p></div>
