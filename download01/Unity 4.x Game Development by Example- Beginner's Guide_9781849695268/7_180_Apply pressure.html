Or what if, in our keep-up game, the player has to bounce the ball without dropping it until the timer runs out in order to advance to the next level? In this chapter, let's:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Program a text-based countdown clock to add a little pressure to our games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Modify the clock to make it graphical, with an ever-shrinking horizontal bar</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Layer in some new code and graphics to create a pie chart-style clock</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_07_01.jpg" /></div><p>That's three different countdown clocks, all running from the same initial code, all ready to be put to work in whatever Unity games you dream up.
