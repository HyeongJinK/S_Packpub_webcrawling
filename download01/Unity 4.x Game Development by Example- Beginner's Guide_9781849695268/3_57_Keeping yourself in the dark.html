The lights aren't actually "real" objects (such as our <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> meshes), they're virtual objects in 3D space that determine whether the faces on a mesh will appear bright or dark. The computer figures this out for us based on the kind of light we use, the way we position and rotate it, and the settings we give it.</p><p>So, while you can move a light around your scene just like the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> or the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span>, there's no actual geometry or triangles comprising the light. Lights aren't made of triangles, they're made of data. In Unity, as in many 3D programs, lights are represented in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view by icons (or as Unity calls themâ€”"gizmos"), with lines indicating their direction or their area of influence.</p></div>
