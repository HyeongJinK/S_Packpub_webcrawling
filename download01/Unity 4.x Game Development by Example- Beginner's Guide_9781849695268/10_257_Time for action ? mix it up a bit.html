In our game, hearing the same two sound effects over and over again is wearying. One of the <a id="id811" class="indexterm"></a>things I like to do is to create a bunch of slightly different sound effects for the same event, and when the time comes to play a sound, I just choose one of them at random. This can really vary the soundscape of the game and keep your player from overdosing on the same sound effects.</p><p>You probably noticed that the <code class="literal">SFX</code> folder contained five versions of the <span class="strong"><strong>smash</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>explosion</strong></span> sound effects. Let's learn how to set them up to play randomly:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="strong"><strong>FallingObject</strong></span> script.</p></li><li><p>Delete the line where you define the <code class="literal">clip1</code> variable, and replace it with an array declaration:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var prefab:GameObject;
var speed:int;
<span class="strong"><strong>var audioClips : AudioClip[];</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>Modify the line where you play the sound:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">audio.PlayOneShot(audioClips[Random.Range(0,audioClips.length)]  );</pre></div><p>Let's take a closer look at this new code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var audioClips : AudioClip[];</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>This is a special built-in array; it is statically typed, which means we're telling Unity what kind of thing it's going to contain. In this case, it's going to be a list of <span class="strong"><strong>AudioClip</strong></span> types. A normal<a id="id812" class="indexterm"></a> array (<code class="literal">var myArray = new Array()</code>) won't show up in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, but a built-in array will.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>audio.PlayOneShot(audioClips[Random.Range(0,audioClips.length)]);</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>What we're doing here is picking a random number from 0 to the built-in array's length. We're using the resulting number as the index of the <code class="literal">audioClip</code> in the array that we want to play. The last step is to click-and-drag the <span class="strong"><strong>explosion</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>smash</strong></span> sound effects into the new built-in array in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Bomb Prefab</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, locate the <span class="strong"><strong>FallingObject</strong></span> component.</p></li><li><p>Click on the gray arrow to expand the <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Clips</strong></span> array.</p></li><li><p>Enter a value of <code class="literal">5</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> label. The list expands even further to accommodate five empty slots for <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Clips</strong></span> objects.</p></li><li><p>Click-and-drag the five explosion sound effects into the various indices of the array.</p></li><li><p>Repeat these steps for the <span class="strong"><strong>Stein Prefab</strong></span> using the <span class="strong"><strong>smash</strong></span> sound effects.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_10_16.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Run the game.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now the <a id="id813" class="indexterm"></a>falling objects make different-ish noises when they hit the ground. Variety is the spice of life. Paprika is also reasonably delicious.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec105"></a>Have a go hero – filling in the gaps</h3></div></div></div><p>Consider this the jumping-off point for your catch game. With the basics roughed in, there are a number of finer elements missing from the experience:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Title screen with <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Instructions page</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Credits screen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>End game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Play Again</strong></span> button</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>On-screen scoring (counting the number of steins the player has collected)</p></li></ul></div><p>Sounds for when the player gets hit by something bad</p><p>We already know how to do a lot of this stuff. We've built a <span class="strong"><strong>Title</strong></span> screen with a <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button for Robot Repair, and it's the same process to build in the other screens, like Credits and Instructions. We've created an on-screen counter for Ticker Taker. We've built a timer for use in our games as well.</p><p>If you imagine all of these elements as ingredients in a cake, you should know how to bake a pretty scrumptious dessert by now. There are a few different decisions you can make about how the game plays:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Score points</strong></span>
</p><p>Let the <a id="id814" class="indexterm"></a>player catch beer steins. Count up each one he catches. End the game when he gets hit by a bomb. Show the player his last and best scores, and add a message when he beats his best score, exactly as we did with Ticker Taker.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Survive</strong></span>
</p><p>Add the timer from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hearty Har Har</em></span>, to the screen. The player has to keep collecting <a id="id815" class="indexterm"></a>beer steins until the timer runs out. He's allowed to miss only three beer steins—if he drops his third stein, or gets hit by a bomb, the game ends. This is different from the last scenario because there's a definite win scenario, whereas the other method kept the player playing until he inevitably lost. This win scenario doesn't lend itself as well to adding a high score board, and it doesn't have as much replay value. But certain players (myself included) just can't get excited about games they can't win.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Quota</strong></span>
</p><p>Clocks are a great and frequently used gameplay tool, but sometimes they just give players the <a id="id816" class="indexterm"></a>jitters. Another way you can determine player's success is by defining a quota: "You must catch x beer steins to finish the game."</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Levels</strong></span>
</p><p>One possibility that a "win" scenario opens up is a multilevel structure for your game. If the player makes it through the first level, you increase the number of bombs (or the falling speed of the objects). Maybe a bus periodically drives through the screen, and the player has to <a id="id817" class="indexterm"></a>jump down a manhole to avoid it? Maybe the mugs get smaller and harder to catch, or the bombs get larger and harder to avoid? If you are using a timer for a survival mode, increase the length of time the player has to spend to survive. If you're using a quota system, increase the number of steins the player has to catch to finish the level.</p><p>In this way, you combine the best of both worlds—the game has finite successes because the player can finish and feel accomplished. But the player is also guaranteed to lose, because the quota <a id="id818" class="indexterm"></a>keeps getting larger and more impossible to fill. You could even loop it right back around and put a level cap on the game; after finishing level 10, the player wins once and for all. Perhaps his high score is the lowest time it took him to complete all ten levels?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Health points</strong></span>
</p><p>You could create some <span class="emphasis"><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></span>-style heart graphics and display them at the top-right of the screen. Every time the player gets hit by a bomb, remove a heart. If the player loses all <a id="id819" class="indexterm"></a>his health, the game ends. This feature works with both the "score points" and "survive" ideas, and helps to give the player much more of a fighting chance. The player is usually more willing to play your game if he perceives that the rules are "fair" and if he can own any mistakes he makes. He should never feel like the game "made him die". Keep in mind that "fair" can sometimes mean "unfairly advantageous to the player"—as long as the computer doesn't "cheat", it's fair in the player's eyes.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Catch unlit bombs</strong></span>
</p><p>You could create another <span class="strong"><strong>bomb Prefab</strong></span> that doesn't have the sparking fuse, and ask that the player catch<a id="id820" class="indexterm"></a> both beer steins AND unlit bombs. The objects would probably need to fall more slowly (or you'd need to pull the camera back to reveal a larger play area), and you may need to increase the size of the fuse sparks to help the player differentiate a lit bomb from an unlit one. Better yet, to make it even more "fair", you could put a bright red texture on the lit bombs.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vary the landscape</strong></span>
</p><p>Doesn't this guy have anything in his apartment other than cartoon bombs and Oktoberfest souvenirs? In order to make the game more visually interesting, you could import a few new models and chuck <span class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> out the window. Tighty whities, action figures, and naughty magazines might make nice additions to the fiction.</p></div></div>
