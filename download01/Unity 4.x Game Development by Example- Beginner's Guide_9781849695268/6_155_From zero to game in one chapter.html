Break all of the missing pieces into little bite-sized tasks. For smaller game projects, I like to put these steps in a list with checkboxes. Then, I can put a big 'X' in the box when I'm finished. There is no more satisfying thing I can do in any given workday than to put X's in boxes.</p><p>Here's what we need to do to get this game working:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Center the grid on the screen.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Put different images on the cards. (It would be great if the cards could be shuffled around every time you played!)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Figure out how to break the robots and distribute their body parts on the cards properly.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make the cards flip over from back to front when you click them.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Prevent the player from flipping over more than two cards in a turn.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Compare two flipped-over cards to see if they match (note: if they match, we should remove the cards from the table. If they don't match, we should flip them back over).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If all of the cards have been removed from the table, show a victory message and a <span class="strong"><strong>Play Again</strong></span> button. The <span class="strong"><strong>Play Again</strong></span> button should restart the game when you click on it.</p></li></ul></div><p>Checkboxes are like<a id="id445" class="indexterm"></a> ferocious dragons. Putting X's in boxes is like slaying those dragons. With each dragon you slay, you've become stronger and wiser, and you're getting closer to your goal. And sometimes, I like to pretend my desk chair is a pony.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Golly-GDD</strong></span>
</p><p>The list we just created is a very simple example of a<a id="id446" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>GDD</strong></span>, a <span class="strong"><strong>Game Design Document</strong></span>. GDDs can be as simple as checklists, or as complicated as 1,000-page Word documents. I like to write my GDDs online in a wiki because it's easier to stay nimble and to change things. My whole team can commit new artwork, ideas, and comments to a living, breathing wiki GDD.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Putting a point on it</strong></span>
</p><p>One interesting tip I've heard about writing GDDs is that you should end each task with a period. This gives the task more weight, as if you're saying, "It shall be so!" Periods, strangely, help to make GDD tasks seem more final, crucial, and concrete.</p></div><p>With this to-do list, and our description of gameplay from the previous chapter, we have our bare-bones GDD. Are you ready? Let's slay some dragons!</p></div>
