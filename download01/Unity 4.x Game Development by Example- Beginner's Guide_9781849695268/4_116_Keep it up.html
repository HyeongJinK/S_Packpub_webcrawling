Certain people are wired to just immediately get it, and some of us have to keep trying, failing, and trying again until that little light turns on. I tried and failed at programming my whole life, from the time I was about ten years old, until I gradually understood it. For me, it was less of a sudden light turning on, and more of a slow, steady burn, as the light bulb filament steadily heated up as if on a dimmer switch. If you want to learn programming in Unity, you're not bound by your intelligence—only by your determination and drive.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec55"></a>Beyond the game mechanic</h3></div></div></div><p>We've added code to our keep-up game to control the paddle, and the game mechanic is amusing, but it's not a game! There's <span class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> much more to game development than just the core mechanic. Our game needs a proper starting point. It needs an ending. It needs a cue telling the player that he's failed when the ball falls on the ground... it needs a ground! Currently, you have to shut down and restart the game every time you drop the ball. We need some kind of <span class="strong"><strong>Play Again</strong></span> button.<a id="id355" class="indexterm"></a> And wouldn't it be nice to have a score counter on the screen telling the player how many bounces he got before dropping the ball? What about sound effects and music? And the box art! We <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to have nice box art!</p><p>We may not get as far as shipping our game out to the shopping mall, but there's still a lot more we can do to make our game more <span class="emphasis"><em>gamey</em></span>. We're going to come back to this game mechanic in a bit because there's definitely something promising here. But, first, we should learn how to put some of those crucial buttons and score counters on the screen. While we figure that out, we're going to use our new-found programming skillz to build a whole other game. Are you ready? Then journey with me to the laboratory of Professor Wrecker…</p></div></div>
