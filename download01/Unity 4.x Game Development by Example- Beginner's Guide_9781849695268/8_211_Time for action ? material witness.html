<span class="strong"><strong>Out with the old</strong></span>
</p><p>If you had eaten your Wheaties this morning, you may have noticed that when we imported the models, their Materials were imported as well. The <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel has a folder called <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> in it, which includes the three drab, boring Materials that we currently see on our models. Unity will import the materials that we create for our models depending on the 3D software package we used. Since these three models were not given Materials in Blender, they came in with default gray Materials. Now's a good time to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> folder in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key (<span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> if you're on a Mac) to get rid of it.  After confirming this action, the models turn pinky-purple. Don't worry—we'll fix that.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Right-click/alternate-click any empty area in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel (or click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button at the top of the panel) and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>.

<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened – understanding Materials</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We've used Materials in a few other situations so far, for fonts and other goofy things, but applying Materials to models is the classic example. If meshes are like chicken wire, Materials are like the papier-mâché coating we lay over them to give them "skin". A <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> is a collection of Shaders and textures that affect how light bounces off our models.</p><p>This diffuse, flat color is about as simple <a id="id639" class="indexterm"></a>as a Material can get. If we wanted to go all-out, we could draw a more realistic image of Nurse Slipperfoot's skin, complete with freckles, beauty marks, and fingernails, in a program like Photoshop. Then we'd import the texture into Unity as an image file, and drag-and-drop it into that <code class="literal">Texture2D</code> slot that you see beneath the Material's color swatch. Suddenly, Nurse Slipperfoot's arms<a id="id640" class="indexterm"></a> would look far more realistic. (It should be obvious, though, that realism isn't exactly what we're going for with this game.)</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip40"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>UV mapping</strong></span>
</p><p>Any textures that we apply to our models this way may wind up disappointingly misaligned. There's a process in 3D texturing called UV mapping, which is where you adjust the position and orientation of your textures in relation to your models. Most textures that get wrapped around anything more complex than a primitive shape require some monkeying around with the models' UV settings, which happens in your 3D art package outside Unity.</p></div><p>You can use textures in combination with Shaders to pull off even more impressive effects. One popular Shader called a <span class="strong"><strong>Bump Map</strong></span><a id="id641" class="indexterm"></a> (<span class="strong"><strong>Bumped Specular</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Bumped Diffuse</strong></span> in Unity) lets you paint the "high" and "low" areas that the light will hit. By creatively painting a flat 2D texture with light and dark tones, you can indicate which parts of the image you want to appear to be raised, and which ones should appear to recede. A bump map <a id="id642" class="indexterm"></a>could give Nurse Slipperfoot's thumbs the illusion that there are modeled fingernails on their ends. The advantage is that you get this illusion without the cost of actually modeling these extra details—the Shader is doing all the work, and is tricking the light into seeing more complex geometry than we actually have. Remember that more polygons (mesh geometry) require more computer power to draw and move around the screen, so faking this complexity with a Shader is a great plan.</p><p>If you're so inclined, you can even program your own Shaders to pull off custom lighting and texturing effects on your models.<a id="id643" class="indexterm"></a> That topic is way outside the scope of a beginner book, but if writing custom Shaders interests you, don't let me hold you back. Go forth and code! You can find some good resources for learning about more complex stuff like custom Shaders in the back of this book.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec89"></a>Have a go hero – adding materials to the other models</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that you know how to create<a id="id644" class="indexterm"></a> your own Materials, create two more<a id="id645" class="indexterm"></a> Materials for your other models—one for the tray and one for the heart.

Then I cranked the "Shininess" slider up.
