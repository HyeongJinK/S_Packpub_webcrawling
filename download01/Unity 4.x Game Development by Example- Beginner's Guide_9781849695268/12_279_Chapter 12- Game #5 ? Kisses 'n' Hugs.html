<span class="emphasis"><em>Cast your memory back to the earliest chapters in this book. You were younger then, and you probably still had all your hair. We were talking about the amount of effort involved in creating games for a single player versus multiple players, on one computer or many, turn-based or real-time.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The games we've created to this point have been single-player, with the player playing against him or herself. The computer presented the player with obstacles or challenges—cards to flip, bombs to avoid—but there really wasn't much decision-making or "thinking" happening on the part of the computer. What if we wanted our player to square off against an artificially intelligent computer opponent? That would be <span class="strong"><strong>way</strong></span> beyond the scope of a beginners book, wouldn't it? As it turns out, maybe not!</em></span>
