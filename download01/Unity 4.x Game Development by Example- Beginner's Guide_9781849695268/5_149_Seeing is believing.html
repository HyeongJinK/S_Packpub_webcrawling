Our cards exist in some imaginary code space, but we've done nothing to actually draw the cards to the screen. Let's build our <code class="literal">OnGUI</code> function and put something on the screen to see where all this is leading.</p><p>On the title screen, we used a Fixed Layout to position our <span class="strong"><strong>Play Game</strong></span> button. We decided exactly where on the screen to put the button, and how big it should be. We're going to build our grid of cards using an Automatic Layout to illustrate the difference.</p><p>With an Automatic Layout, you define an area and place your GUI controls inside it. You create your controls using the built-in <code class="literal">GUILayout</code> class, instead of the <code class="literal">GUI</code> class. The controls that you create with <code class="literal">GUILayout</code> stretch to fill the layout area.</p></div>
