The idea is that any time you type the same thing twice, you could be wasting time and effort. Remember that the less typing we do, the less likely we are to drop dead from the programmer illness I totally fabricated. The less duplication we do, the less "maintenance" we have to do if something goes wrong later—correcting one chunk of code is easier than correcting multiple duplicated chunks. But the rule for beginners is this: make it work first—<span class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span> make it elegant.</p><p>Notice that we have some duplication in this line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">transform.position.x = Input.mousePosition.x – Screen.width/2)/(Screen.width/2);</pre></div><p>We've typed <code class="literal">Screen.width/2</code> twice. That won't do! For starters, typing makes my hands tired. What's more, we're forcing the computer to do that complicated math calculation twice. Why not do the calculation once and ask the computer to remember the result? Then, any time we want to talk about the screen's midpoint, we can ask the computer to retrieve the result.</p><p>We do this by<a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a> creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span>. A <span class="emphasis"><em>variable</em></span> is a reserved storage locker in memory. I like to think of it as a <span class="strong"><strong>bucket that can hold one thing</strong></span>. Just as we saw with functions, variables are created by declaring them.</p><p>(To be totally honest, an extra division operation isn't going to bring your game to its knees. But, there are more "costly" operations we could ask Unity to perform, and learning to put things in variable buckets now is good practice to prepare us for the heavy lifting that we'll do later).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_21.jpg" /></div></div>
