There's a potential problem here: because Unity is superfast at calculating the <code class="literal">Screen.width</code> property, it might do so before the game screen has finished resizing and initializing, returning an incorrect value. By moving the variable definition to the <code class="literal">Start</code> function, we're giving Unity a few CPU cycles to make itself decent before we go barging in demanding screen properties.</p><p>Defining <code class="literal">halfButtonW</code> at the top of the class won't break anything, but some programmers would prefer to see the definition separated from the declaration.</p></div>
