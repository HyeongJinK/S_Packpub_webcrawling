You can also copy the game files to another folder, as we did with <span class="emphasis"><em>The Break-Up</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shoot the Moon</em></span>.</p><p>Once the project is open, find the <span class="strong"><strong>Game Scene</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and double-click to open it (if it doesn't open by default). You should see the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> just as we left it: heart, hands, and tray.</p><p>I took the time to organize the different assets into folders to tidy up the project.
