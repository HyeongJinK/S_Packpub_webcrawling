We could do what we've done before and add a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody Collider </strong></span>Component to the bomb, as we<a id="id738" class="indexterm"></a> did with the ball/heart in the keep-up <a id="id739" class="indexterm"></a>game, and let Unity's physics take care of the rest. But in this case, we might like a little more control over the velocity of the bombs. So let's add Rigidbody and Collider Components to the bomb, but exclude it from Unity's gravity calculations.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Bomb</strong></span> Prefab.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span>.

We don't need any fancy poly-perfect <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Collider</strong></span> in this case because the bomb is basically a sphere anyway.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, enter a value of <code class="literal">2</code> for the <span class="strong"><strong>radius</strong></span> of <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere Collider</strong></span>.

You can confirm this by placing a <span class="strong"><strong>Bomb</strong></span> Prefab in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and checking it out, or you can take my word for it.</p></li></ol></div><p>You'll remember from the keep-up game that the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span> Collider/Capsule Collider Components work together to make code respond when <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> touch each other.</p></div>
