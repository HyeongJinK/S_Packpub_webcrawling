Why is that?</p><p>The <code class="literal">Update</code> function is still getting called multiple times. But each time, it's putting the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> at two units on the X-axis. The value of <code class="literal">x</code> changes on every <code class="literal">Update</code>, but it changes to the <span class="emphasis"><em>same thing</em></span>. So, once <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> is in position, it doesn't appear to move.</p><p>With our new modified line of code, the <code class="literal">x</code><a id="id305" class="indexterm"></a> position of the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> is changing by <code class="literal">0.2</code> every time the <code class="literal">Update</code> function is called, so <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> moves across the screen.</p><p>An important part of being a beginner programmer is keeping a positive attitude. You should start with the assumption that what you want to do <span class="strong"><strong>can</strong></span> be doneâ€”anything is possible. We now know how to set the position of the paddle. With your positive, can-do attitude, you might imagine that to get the paddle moving around with the mouse, you could find the position of the mouse, and set the <code class="literal">transform.position.x</code> property to match.</p><p>But, what <span class="emphasis"><em>words</em></span> do you <a id="id306" class="indexterm"></a>need to use to get the position of the mouse? For the answer, let's dive back into the Unity Script Reference.</p></div>
