Choose a very basic game and recreate it on your own. Many programmers use Tetris as their learning project. For a very basic introduction to a language or tool, I like to use Memory.</p><p>"But, wait!" you say: "Memory games are stupid and boring, and they're for babies, and I'll positively die if I have to build one!" Of course, you're right. You're not going to be lauded by critics and raved about by gamers for building a simple memory game. But, it's a fun challenge to set for yourself: how can you take a game that everyone has played before a million times, and put a simple twist on it to make it more interesting? How can you work within those constraints to make it your own, and to showcase your creativity?</p><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>Robot Repair</strong></span>, we'll lay out a 4 x 4 grid of 16 cards. There are four different robot types: a yellow robot, a red robot, a blue robot, and a green robot. To make things interesting, we're going to break these robots; rip off an arm here, tear off a leg there. The player has to match each broken robot with its missing body part!</p><p>Once the player wins, we'll give him the <a id="id413" class="indexterm"></a>option to play again. The <span class="strong"><strong>Play Again</strong></span> button will link him back to the title screen.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_05_26.jpg" /></div><p>Starting your game development career by building simple starter games like Memory is like eating a big slice of humble pie. But this is all in the spirit of crawling before you walk. While you're crawling, how can you make things interesting for yourself? And, if you can't flex a little creative muscle in the confines of a simple game, how will you survive when you're <a id="id414" class="indexterm"></a>building your dream project?</p></div>
