We already saw a component called <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> when we created our <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> GameObjects. If you don't remember, have a look:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span>, if <a id="id276" class="indexterm"></a>you haven't already.</p></li><li><p>Look in the list of the components of the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. There should be one component there called <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>If you see only the name of the component, click on the gray arrow next to the component name to expand the component.</p></li></ol></div><p>Aha! What do we have here? Something called <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span>—it has a checkmark next to it. What happens if you click on it to uncheck that checkbox?</p><p>Go on—try it!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268_04_05.jpg" /></div><p>The ball disappeared. <a id="id277" class="indexterm"></a> No surprises there. We saw something similar happen when we clicked on the checkmark beside an entire <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in the previous chapter.</p><p>But, I wonder, does this <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component have anything to do with the "renderer" we talked about in our <code class="literal">DisappearMe</code> Script? Checking that checkbox certainly seemed to have the same <a id="id278" class="indexterm"></a>effect as running a Script that said <code class="literal">renderer.enabled = false;</code>.</p><p>Let's be bold here. We need to figure this out. We'll leave the checkbox unchecked and modify our Script to get a solid answer.</p></div>
