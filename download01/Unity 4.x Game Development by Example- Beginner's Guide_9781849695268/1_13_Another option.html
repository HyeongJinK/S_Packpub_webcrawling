FusionFall is very impressive, and it might look a lot like the game that you've always dreamed of making. This book is not about crushing your dreams. It's about dialing down your expectations, putting those dreams in an airtight jar, and taking baby steps. <span class="emphasis"><em>Confucius</em></span> said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</p></blockquote></div><p>I don't know much about the man's hobbies, but if he was into video games, he might have said something similar about them—creating a game with a thousand awesome features begins by creating a single, less feature-rich game.</p><p>So, let's put the FusionFall dream in an airtight jar and come back to it when we're ready. We'll take a look at some smaller Unity 3D game examples and talk about what it took to build them.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"></a>Off-Road Velociraptor Safari</h3></div></div></div><p>No tour of Unity 3D games<a id="id24" class="indexterm"></a> would be complete without a trip to <a class="ulink" href="http://Blurst.com" target="_blank">Blurst.com</a>—the game portal owned and operated by independent game developer <a id="id25" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Flashbang Studios</strong></span>. In addition to hosting games by other independent game developers, Flashbang has packed <span class="strong"><strong>Blurst</strong></span><a id="id26" class="indexterm"></a> with its own slate of kooky content, including <span class="strong"><strong>Off-Road Velociraptor Safari</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_04.jpg" /></div><p>In Off-Road Velociraptor Safari, you play with a dinosaur in a pith helmet and a monocle driving a jeep equipped with a deadly spiked ball on a chain (just like in the archaeology textbooks). Your goal is to spin around in your jeep doing tricks and murdering your fellow dinosaurs (obviously).</p><p>For many independent<a id="id27" class="indexterm"></a> game developers and reviewers, Off-Road Velociraptor Safari was their first introduction to Unity. Some reviewers said that they were stunned that a fully 3D game could play in the browser. Other reviewers were a little bummed that the game was sluggish on slower computers. We'll talk about optimization a little later, but it's not too early to keep performance in mind as you start out.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Fewer features, more promises</h3></div></div></div><p>If you play<a id="id28" class="indexterm"></a> Off-Road Velociraptor Safari and some of the other games on the Blurst site, you'll get a better sense of what you can do with Unity without a team of experienced Korean MMO developers. The game has 3D models, physics (code that controls how things move around somewhat realistically), collisions (code that detects when things hit each other), music, and sound effects. Just like FusionFall, the game can be played in the browser with the Unity Web Player plugin. Flashbang Studios also sells downloadable versions of its games, demonstrating that Unity can produce standalone executable game files too.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"></a>Maybe we should build Off-Road Velociraptor Safari?</h3></div></div></div><p>Right then! We can't create FusionFall just yet, but we can surely create a tiny game like Off-Road Velociraptor Safari, right? Well... no. Again, this book isn't about crushing your game development dreams. But the fact remains that Off-Road Velociraptor Safari took five supremely talented and experienced guys eight weeks to build on full-time hours, and they've been tweaking and improving it ever since. Even a game like this, which may seem quite small in comparison to full-blown MMO like FusionFall, is a daunting challenge for a solo developer. Put it in a jar up on the shelf, and let's take a look at something you'll have more success with.</p></div></div>
