However, you can click to place many X's, and they start erupting like popcorn and falling over the edge of the invisible floor, making our Tic Tac Toe game look more like a game of Perfection™ (as played by wombats).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_12_17.jpg" /></div></div></div>
