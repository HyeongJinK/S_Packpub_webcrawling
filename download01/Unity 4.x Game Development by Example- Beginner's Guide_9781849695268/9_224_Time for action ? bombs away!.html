They can be used to depict smoke, fire, water, sparks, magic, jetstreams, plasma, and a pile of other natural and unnatural phenomena. Essentially, they're a ton of tiny little flat images that turn to face the camera, in a common 3D technique called <span class="strong"><strong>billboarding</strong></span>.<a id="id691" class="indexterm"></a> Each little picture can be textured, just like the Material on a 3D model. The little pictures support transparency, so they don't have to look like squares. Particle systems have an emitter, which is <a id="id692" class="indexterm"></a>where the particles come from. The built-in particle<a id="id693" class="indexterm"></a> system that ships with Unity lets you control a dizzying array of additional parameters, such as the number, color, frequency, direction, and randomness of the particles.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip45"></a>Tip</h3><p>

</p><p>Many game developers use particle effects as a cheap trick to reward their players. For many casual gamers, the best piece of feedback in a puzzle game is a satisfying sound effect paired with an explosion of particles. Games like Bejeweled and Peggle put particle systems to work with great results.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_09_05.jpg" /></div><p>Right now, our particle effect looks like spooky forest fairy magic, floating around our bomb. We want something closer to the classic Warner Bros. Wile E. Coyote bomb, with sparks shooting out of the fuse. Let's explore the wide range of settings that Unity's particle <a id="id694" class="indexterm"></a>systems offer.</p><p>Click <a id="id695" class="indexterm"></a>on <span class="strong"><strong>Sparks </strong></span>Particle System in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel if it's not already selected.</p><p>Check out the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. There are a metric ton of settings and dials for tweaking particle systems! We won't discuss them exhaustively because that's what software manuals are for. Suffice it to say, the best way to get what you want out of particle systems is to poke things until it looks right. Let's get poking!</p></div>
