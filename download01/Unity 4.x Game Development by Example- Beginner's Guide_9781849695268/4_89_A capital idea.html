<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec94"></a>A capital idea</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component is listed as <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> with an uppercase <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span>. When we refer to it in code, we use a lowercase <span class="emphasis"><em>t</em></span>. In the<a id="id296" class="indexterm"></a> Script Reference, it has an uppercase <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> again. But, if you've already made the mistake of using an uppercase <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> in your code, Unity threw you an error in the console window. What gives?</p><p>Unity's language is <span class="strong"><strong>case sensitive</strong></span>, which means that a word with a capital letter is treated as a completely different thing than the same word with a small letter. So, <code class="literal">transform</code> and <code class="literal">Transform</code> are as different from each other as the words <span class="emphasis"><em>night</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>day</em></span>.</p><p>
<code class="literal">Transform</code> is a class. A <span class="strong"><strong>class</strong></span><a id="id297" class="indexterm"></a> is like a blueprint that you use to make other things. You might implement power-ups in your keep-up game. Your capital-<span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> <code class="literal">Powerup</code> class describes what a power-up should look like and how it should behave. You might create a new power-up using your <code class="literal">Powerup</code> class, and label it <code class="literal">powerup</code> with a small <span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span>. The capital-<span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> <code class="literal">Powerup</code> class<a id="id298" class="indexterm"></a> contains the instructions for building something, and lowercase-<span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span> <code class="literal">powerup</code> is the name you gave to the thing you've built with that blueprint.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_04_15.jpg" /></div><p>So, in this case, capital-<a id="id299" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span> <code class="literal">Transform</code> is the class, or blueprint, that describes how a transform works. Small-<span class="emphasis"><em>t</em></span> <code class="literal">transform</code> is the name our <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> gives to its own transform instance, which was built using the <code class="literal">Transform</code> blueprint. This upper-case class/lower-case instance is a coding <span class="emphasis"><em>convention</em></span>, and so is not shouting at the dinner table; let's follow the convention to keep things civil.</p><p>Here are a few more examples to help you understand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Car</code> is the class (blueprint). We use it to make a new car instance, which we call <code class="literal">car</code> (small <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">House</code> is the class (blueprint). We use it to build a new house instance, which we call <code class="literal">house</code> (small <span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span>).</p></li></ul></div><p>We can use these classes to create multiple copies, or instances, of a thing. The <code class="literal">Car</code> class could stamp out many things, which we could call <code class="literal">car1</code>, <code class="literal">car2</code>, and <code class="literal">car3</code>. We could also call those things <code class="literal">sedan</code>, <code class="literal">convertible</code>, and <code class="literal">suv</code>. In Unity-land, the developers decided to call the thing that was created with the <code class="literal">Transform</code> class <code class="literal">transform</code>. It could just as easily have been called <code class="literal">pinkElephant</code>, but <code class="literal">transform</code> makes more sense.</p></div>
