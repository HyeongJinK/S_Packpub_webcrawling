This model contains two separate meshes—a pair of hands, and a hospital dinner tray. There seem to be two instances of each, with two different icons next to them—a blue cube icon with a little white page and a black meshy/spiderwebby-looking icon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_08_03.jpg" /></div><p>Here's what's happening. The top-level <span class="strong"><strong>handsAndTray</strong></span> parent is the <code class="literal">.fbx</code> file that Unity imported. Before you can use this file inside the program, Unity runs it through an import process to make sure that the<a id="id616" class="indexterm"></a> models are the right size and orientation, along with a slew of other settings. The routine that preps the models for use in Unity is the <span class="strong"><strong>FBXImporter</strong></span>. You can see it by clicking on the parent <span class="strong"><strong>handsAndTray</strong></span> model in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_08_04.jpg" /></div><p>There's a lot of fancy stuff going on with the <span class="strong"><strong>FBXImporter</strong></span>. Thankfully, we don't have to touch much of it. Our biggest concern is that the models are facing the right way, and are the right size. Different models from different 3D software packages can import in funny ways, so this is like our check-in counter <a id="id617" class="indexterm"></a>to make sure everything's okay before we admit the model into our <span class="emphasis"><em>Hotel de Game</em></span>. At the very bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>FBXImporter</strong></span>, you can see what the model looks like.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip36"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rank and file</strong></span>
</p><p>Unity has superpowers. It's true. Even better, it's like one of those superheroes that can absorb other superheroes' powers. Unity doesn't have modeling or art tools itself, but, as we've seen, it can import meshes and images from the outside world. And if you have a supported 3D software package (like 3D Studio Max, Maya, or Blender) or 2D software package (like Photoshop) installed on your computer, Unity can import the native file format. That means your <code class="literal">.max</code>, .<code class="literal">ma</code>, <code class="literal">.blend</code>, and <code class="literal">.psd</code> files will be sitting right there in the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder. If you double-click one of these assets, Unity is smart enough to launch the corresponding program for you. And if you make a change to the file and save it, the results are automatically updated right inside your project's <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder. No need to re-import the file!</p><p>You can also tell Unity which program you'd like to launch when you double-click a file with a format that can be read by many different programs, like <code class="literal">.fbx</code> or <code class="literal">.jpg</code>. Here's a list of native 3D file formats and software packages that Unity supported at the time of this writing:</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Maya <code class="literal">.mb</code> and <code class="literal">.ma</code>

If you work a lot with Photoshop, you'll appreciate that you don't have to flatten your image and save it out to another format—just hide or show your various layers, and save the file. Unity automatically flattens the psd for you and updates the image.</p></div></div>
