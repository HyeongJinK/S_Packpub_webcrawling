<span class="strong"><strong>Anticipating the turns</strong></span>
</p><p>Are you wondering why we dropped a keyframe 20 frames before turning the corner? If we had simply rotated the runner at each corner, Unity would have tweened towards that new rotation the entire time the nurse was running down the hallway. We want the rotation to stay constant almost to the end of the hallway, so we set a keyframe as a sort of break point to tell Unity "okay, you can start tweening the rotation right here".</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec137"></a>Have a go hero – give Robo-Nurse a soul</h3></div></div></div><p>With straight Bezier curves connecting our nodes, our <code class="literal">runner</code> animation tends to look a little artificial or robotic. Now that you've seen the right-click menu to adjust the smoothness of those Beziers, why not spend some time fiddling with the handles to see if you can eke out a more natural motion through the hallway? But first, a warning: adjusting Bezier handles for 3D animation can be very time-consuming! If you get bogged down, or lose heart, just select the nodes and slap "Linear" on them to be done with it. That's the equivalent of blowing up a building and walking away in slow motion like a badass while a giant fireball ignites the sky. Aww yeah.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec138"></a>Have a go hero – use your new-found powers for good</h3></div></div></div><p>Just as we did with our other games, let's whip up a quick list of modifications and improvements we could make to Ticker Taker to make it a <a id="id1075" class="indexterm"></a>complete game.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Title Screen, Instructions, Credits—these all go without saying.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Sound Effects—you know how to hook these in, so why dontcha? Ticker Taker cries out for a big wet *squish* whenever the heart hits the tray. You could also add the frantic clippity-clop sounds of Nurse Slipperfoot's Doc Martens slapping the linoleum as she makes her mad dash down the hallway.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Returning to the debate of creating an endless, player-always-loses game versus one the player can finish, what if you built a GUI element that depicted a 2D nurse icon running from point A to point B, like the progress meters you see in racing games? All the player has to do is keep the heart aloft until the nurse icon reaches the end of the progress bar to win.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>To add a bit of difficulty, you could add a little ECG heart monitor to the corner of the screen that beeps every time the player bounces the heart with enough force. Add a timer so that if x seconds elapse without the player bouncing the heart hard enough, the heart stops beating and the player loses the game. This will ensure that the player doesn't simply let the heart roll around gently on the tray until the nurse reaches the transplant ward.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The player's going to catch on pretty quickly that Nurse Slipperfoot is running in a circle! How about building two connected hallways, and making her run a figure-8 course for added visual variety?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The hallway is pretty flat and bland at the moment. Perhaps you could add spice to the environment by placing gurneys, IV stands, and even other patients in the level.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
