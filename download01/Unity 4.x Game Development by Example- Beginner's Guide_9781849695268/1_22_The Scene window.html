This window has various controls to change its level of detail. Use these controls to toggle lighting on and off (in the editor only—not in your actual game), and to display the window contents with textures, wireframes, or a combination of both. You can use the colorful <span class="strong"><strong>Gizmos</strong></span> at the top-right corner to constrain the view to the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> axes to view the top and sides of your scene. Click on the white box in the middle to return to Perspective view. This window also features a search field. </p><p>Try clicking on the gizmo's green <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> cone to view the AngryBots Demo from above, and then type <code class="literal">rock</code> into the search field. Every object with <code class="literal">rock</code> in its name lights up, while the rest of the scene fades to grayscale. Click the tiny <span class="strong"><strong>x</strong></span> button to clear the search field:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_08.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"></a>The Game window</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> window <a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a>shows you what your players will see. When you click on the Play button to test your game (as you just did with the Angry Bots Demo), the results of your efforts play out in this window. Toggle the <span class="strong"><strong>Maximize on Play</strong></span> button to test your game in full-screen mode:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_09.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"></a>The Hierarchy panel</h3></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>lists all of the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span>—cameras, lights, models, and prefabs—are the things that make up your game. They can be "tangible" things like the generators or the giant robot arm in the Angry Bots Demo. They can also include intangible things, which only you as the game developer get to see and play with, such as the cameras, the lights, the scripts, and <span class="emphasis"><em>colliders</em></span>, which  are special invisible shapes that tell the game engine when two game objects are touching.</p><p>The AngryBots Demo <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel contains <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> for the cannisters, the tables, the airlocks and the computer terminals, to name a few. It also lists the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span>, a very complicated GameObject that controls how the hero moves and collides with his environment. The player character has a camera following him. That camera is our eye into the game world. The Demo lists a collection called <span class="strong"><strong>Environment(sounds)</strong></span>—a series of <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> that determine what the player hears when he walks through different parts of the level (for example, torrential rain outside, and the droning equipment hum when he moves indoors). So, <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> can include touchy-feely "physical" objects such as canisters and airlocks, as well as behind-the-scenes intangible things such as lights, cameras, and actions (scripts).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_10.jpg" /></div><p>Click on a <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, and then hover your mouse over the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> window. Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key on your keyboard, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> window will automatically pan and <a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a>zoom directly to that object. Alternatively, you can navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Frame Selected</strong></span>, which can be more reliable than using the keyboard shortcut. (I like to think of the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key standing for "Focus" to help me remember what this shortcut does). You can also double-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"></a>The Project panel</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel lists <a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a>all of the elements that you'll use to create <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> in your project. For example, look for the <code class="literal">mech_bot</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Objects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Enemies</strong></span> folder. The AngryBots Demo <code class="literal">EnemyMech</code> <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> is made up of a series of meshes that represent the mech's shape, a material to depict its "skin" or coloring, and an animation to describe its movement. All of these types of goodies are listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel displays the contents of a special folder called <code class="literal">Assets</code> on your computer's operating system. Unity automatically creates the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder for you when you create a new project. If you drag a compatible file, like a 3D model, a sound effect, or an image into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, Unity copies it to the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder behind the scenes, and displays it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_21(2).jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"></a>The Inspector panel</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id59" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span><a id="id60" class="indexterm"></a> is a context-sensitive panel, which means that it changes depending on what you select elsewhere in Unity. This is where you can adjust the position, rotation, and scale of <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span> listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> can also display controls to configure components that add functionality to the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObjects</strong></span>. Between the three main panels in Unity (Hierarchy, Project, and Inspector), the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> is where you'll likely spend most of your time because that's where you'll be tweaking and fiddling with every aspect of the elements that comprise your game projects.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_21.jpg" /></div><p>This screenshot of the <a id="id61" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel<a id="id62" class="indexterm"></a> shows the components attached to the <span class="strong"><strong>Player GameObject</strong></span> in the Angry Bots Demo.

We'll begin the demo with the hero standing on his head (which is a sure-fire way to make those bots even angrier, by the way).</p><p>We can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel to<a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a> change the rotation of the player. Follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, click to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> game object.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotate</strong></span> button near the top left of the screen, which looks like two arrows sniffing each<a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a> others' behinds:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_23.jpg" /></div><p>A globe appears around the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> GameObject in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. (If you don't see the player, hover over the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key on your keyboard.) The blue <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>-axis rotator handle encircles the player's body. Clicking and dragging it rotates the player model as if he were standing in a very dodgy canoe. The red <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>-axis rotator handle rotates the player as if he was a foosball player, stuck on a metal rod. If we click and drag that handle, the player rotates to either fall flat on his face, or flat on his back, like he's got space sickness. And the green <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>-axis rotator handle runs around the player like a hula hoop. Dragging this handle around makes the player spin to face different directions. The Player <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> can get pretty hairy; in order to isolate the rotation controls, type <code class="literal">player</code> into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> window's search field to exclude all other <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_24.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You can click-and-drag the red <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>-axis rotator handle to turn the player upside down, but a better method is to change the X-axis rotation in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. Expand the gray arrow next to <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel if it's not already open, and change the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> value under <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> to <code class="literal">180</code>. The player flips upside down.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_01_25.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, when you click <a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a>on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button to test the game, the player will break-dance his way around the Angry Bots Demo, electric boogaloo-style. The robots are freaking out, thinking "ERROR! DOES NOT COMPUTE!" Way to keep them on their mechanical toes.</p></li></ol></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> is the component that governs a GameObject's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span>. Every object in the scene has a Transform component that determines where it is (Position), how big or small it is (Scale), and how it's oriented (Rotation). Objects can be stretched and deformed by scaling them along one axis, as we'll see in later chapters.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec22"></a>Layers and layout dropdowns</h3></div></div></div><p>Above the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a>you'll see the <span class="strong"><strong>Layer</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Tag</strong></span> drop-down menus. Game objects can be grouped into layers, somewhat like in Photoshop or Flash. Unity stores a few commonly used layouts in the <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> drop-down menu (mine is set to the <span class="strong"><strong>2 by 3</strong></span> configuration).

<span class="strong"><strong>The Hand tool</strong></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span>): Use it<a id="id72" class="indexterm"></a> to click-and-drag around your scene. Hold down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> key on your keyboard to <a id="id73" class="indexterm"></a>rotate the view. Use your mouse wheel to zoom the scene in and out.

This is a way for <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> to navigate around the game world. It doesn't actually impact the way the player sees the game. To modify the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view, you need to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Move</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Rotate</strong></span> tools to modify the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> position.
