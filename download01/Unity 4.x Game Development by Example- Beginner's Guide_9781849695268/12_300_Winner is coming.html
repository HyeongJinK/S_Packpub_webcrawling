In the <code class="literal">GameLogic</code> script, scaffold the mighty hard-fought <code class="literal">CheckForWin</code> function:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">function CheckForWin(square:GameObject):boolean
{
  
}</pre></div><p>Did you notice something different about this function declaration? It's got a big, ugly <code class="literal">boolean</code> stuck to the side of its face. (Geeâ€”it should really get that looked at).</p><p>This function declares a return type. We've already called numerous functions that have a return value, but this is the first time we've set one up in our own custom code. All it means is that somewhere along the way, this function will spit out a boolean value. In fact, it <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> spit out a boolean value, or else we'll get script error.</p><p>To spit out a<a id="id935" class="indexterm"></a> value, we'll use the <code class="literal">return</code> keyword. This <code class="literal">CheckForWin</code> function must, at some point, return either <code class="literal">true</code> or <code class="literal">false</code>, or a statement that resolves to true or false, such as <code class="literal">(2+2)==4</code> (true!) or <code class="literal">beeStings=="awesome"</code> (false!).</p><p>The function is ready. Please fasten your seatbelt, because coding it is going to be turbulent.</p></div>
