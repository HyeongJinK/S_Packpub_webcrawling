We can<a id="id877" class="indexterm"></a> fire bullets and explodify enemy ships. Although it may well defy the laws of physics, a satisfying fiery explosion occurs in the oxygen-free vacuum of space. But there's just something... missing, yes?</p><p>Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the most scientifically accurate sound for a neon-green irradiated bullet being fired through space, and the results have settled unanimously on the onomatopoeic "pew". Luckily, we have just such a sound effect in our <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder, so let's get it going.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>At the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>HeroShip</strong></span> Script, declare a variable to hold the "pew" sound effect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>  var pew:AudioClip;</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>In the left-mouse button firing section of the code, play the "pew" sound effect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)){
<span class="strong"><strong>      audio.PlayOneShot(pew);</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li><p>Save and close the script.</p></li><li><p>Find <a id="id878" class="indexterm"></a>the "pew" sound effect in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, click to select the <span class="strong"><strong>HeroShip</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click and drag the "pew" sound effect into the <span class="strong"><strong>HeroShip</strong></span> Script component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, in the slot labeled "pew".</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_11_25.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to apply the changes to the source <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span>.</p><p>Now when you fire, the spaceship goes "pew".

That's the difference a theme makes. The underlying bones of both games are quite similar, and it wasn't an enormous effort to make these changes. It's the rough equivalent of throwing a new coat of paint and some seat warmers on last year's model and selling it as a brand new car.</p><p>And I say "why not"? The beautiful thing about game development is that you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. You should absolutely build things with a mind towards reusing them in future projects. The momentum you build up will make you an unstoppable game dev machine.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec109"></a>Have a go hero – filling in the empty space</h3></div></div></div><p>This game, like The Break-Up, has a number of missing elements that I'll let you fill in, based on what you've learned in previous chapters. But in addition to the title screen, instructions, credits, win/lose conditions, and player health that we discussed earlier, here are a few ideas<a id="id879" class="indexterm"></a> to strive for if you decide to develop <span class="strong"><strong>Shoot the Moon</strong></span> further:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Build a couple of neat-looking jet trail particle systems and hook them up to the exhaust pipes sticking out the back of your hero ship.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make the ship angle as it moves left and right. You might try repurposing some of your paddle code from the code of <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hearty Har Har</em></span>, to do this.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add some power-ups that appear randomly in the void of space. If the player collides with them, you can give him awesome skillz... maybe he becomes invincible for a short period of time? Or you could crank up the number of bullets that he can fire, for a triple-shot effect. That's a very easy change to make based on the code you've already written.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Duplicate and reupholster an enemy ship to paint it purple or something. Give that type of ship some hit points so that it doesn't explode until it's been hit by <span class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> bullets.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mess around with the enemy ship's movement script. Using mathemagic, can you make the ships travel diagonally, or even in spirals or waves? Can you do it without math?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make it so that when you hold down the mouse button, you charge up a super shot, and when you let go, some crazy-huge bullet blasts out of your ship's nose cone.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make the enemy ships fire back!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>After the player has shot down x enemy ships, introduce the big boss: THE MOON. Give the moon a big pile of hit points and some missiles. Then, and only then, will the title of the game make sense... which I'm sure has been keeping you up at night.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
