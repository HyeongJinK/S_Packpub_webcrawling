<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec141"></a>Set the stage for robots</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The excitement is palpable! We have a shiny-looking title screen promising something about robots. There's a glistening <span class="strong"><strong>Play Game</strong></span> button that, when clicked, takes us to a new scene where our flip n' match memory game will live. It's time now to build that game.</p><p>Make sure your game's not still running—the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button at the top of the screen should not be lit up. Double-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>game</strong></span> scene in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Unity may ask you to save the <span class="strong"><strong>title</strong></span> scene if you haven't already—if that's the case, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> when you're prompted.</p><p>Just as we did with the <span class="strong"><strong>title</strong></span> scene, we should change the camera background color to white. Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, and change its view color by clicking on the color swatch in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</p></div>
