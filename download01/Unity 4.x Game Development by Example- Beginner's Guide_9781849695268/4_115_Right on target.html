<code class="literal">target Quaternion</code>. We know <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> we need it: because we have to feed a <code class="literal">to</code> Quaternion to the <code class="literal">Slerp()</code> function. To better understand the penultimate line, let's break it down like we did before.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var target : Quaternion = Quaternion.Euler (tiltAroundX, 0, tiltAroundZ);</pre></div><p>We're creating a variable called <code class="literal">target</code>, which is a bucket. Then, we're putting something in that bucket that we know is going to be of type <code class="literal">Quaternion</code>. We're calling the <code class="literal">Euler</code> function of the <code class="literal">Quaternion</code> class and passing to it, three arguments.</p><p>Try typing <code class="literal">Quaternion.Euler(</code> into your Script, and reading the tooltip that pops up. The <code class="literal">Euler</code> function needs three arguments of type <code class="literal">float</code>. Notice also that there's a little page 1/2 indicator in the tooltip. If you press the down arrow on your keyboard, you'll see that this method will also take one argument of type <code class="literal">Vector3</code>. We've seen the <code class="literal">Vector3</code> class before (earlier in this chapter). A quick trip to the Script Reference reminds us that <code class="literal">Vector3</code> is made up of three different parts: <code class="literal">x</code>, <code class="literal">y</code>, and <code class="literal">z</code>, which are all of <code class="literal">float</code> type. Hmm!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>
<code class="literal">Quaternion.Euler</code> is what's called an <span class="emphasis"><em>overloaded method</em></span>. <a id="id352" class="indexterm"></a>That means it has more than one function <a id="id353" class="indexterm"></a>signature, so that it can accept two different sets of arguments. You want to pass it <code class="literal">Vector3</code>? You pass it <code class="literal">Vector3</code>. You wanna pass it three floats? You pass it three floats. You wanna pass it seven ints and a boolean? TOUGH NUTS! That's not one of the overloaded options.</p></div><p>The rest is history. We're using our <code class="literal">TiltAroundX</code> and <code class="literal">TiltAroundZ</code> variables in the <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">z</code> slots, and because there's no change in the <code class="literal">y</code> rotation, we're passing zero. The <code class="literal">Euler</code> function gives us a <span class="strong"><strong>return value</strong></span>,<a id="id354" class="indexterm"></a> which is like putting money into a vending machine and getting change. We feed it values for <code class="literal">x</code>, <code class="literal">y</code>, and <code class="literal">z</code> (or a single <code class="literal">Vector3</code>), and it spits out a crazy-complex <code class="literal">Quaternion</code> for us that we probably couldn't have constructed on our own. With any luck, we'll get a candy bar too!</p><p>We take the resulting <code class="literal">Quaternion</code>, store it in a variable (bucket) called <code class="literal">target</code>, and use that as the <code class="literal">to</code> argument in the <code class="literal">Slerp()</code> function of the last line.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec54"></a>Have a go hero â€“ time to break stuff</h3></div></div></div><p>But don't take my word for it. If you're still confused about what does what or you want to put this sample code through its paces, go for it. Here are a few things to try:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Change the values for the <code class="literal">smooth</code> and/or <code class="literal">tiltAngle</code> variables, and test your game (make sure that whatever value you try still has a decimal point). What effect do the new numbers have on the movement of the paddle?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Reverse any number in the code by putting a minus sign (<code class="literal">-</code>) in front of it.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Divide instead of multiplying.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Subtract instead of adding.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Try creating separate variables called <code class="literal">tiltAngleX</code> and <code class="literal">tiltAngleZ</code> to control the <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">z</code> tilt amounts independently.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Try creating a new variable of type <code class="literal">Vector3</code> using the <code class="literal">tiltAroundX</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, and <code class="literal">tiltAroundZ</code> values. Then, pass the resulting <code class="literal">Vector3</code> as a single argument to the <code class="literal">Quaternion.Euler</code> function. Does your code still work?</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
