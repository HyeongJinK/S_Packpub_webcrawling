<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch13lvl1sec321"></a>It's a trap!</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>What are the most powerful ways in which to play this game? Tic Tac Toe neophytes suppose that the most powerful <a id="id985" class="indexterm"></a>square on the grid is the middle. After all, doesn't the most high-profile washed-up celebrity get the center square on Hollywood Squares?</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_06.jpg" /></div><p>However, as any discerning Tic Tac Toe player knows, playing the corners is perhaps a wiser move, because it facilitates a trap, where scoring 3-in-a-row is possible in two different places. Blocking one path simply allows the player to win with the second path.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_13_07.jpg" /></div><p>So in this situation, blocking is not an option. The only viable options are to win, if possible, or to have <a id="id986" class="indexterm"></a>prevented the opponent from creating a trap to begin with. So that gives us one more rule for our AI player:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Prevent a trap</p></li></ul></div><p>And really, if it's possible to set a trap for the opponent, we want our artificially intelligent computer player to try to do that. So we have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Prevent a trap</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a trap</p></li></ul></div><p>Where do these two things fit in our existing prioritized list of rules?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Win</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Block</p></li></ul></div><p>Since a player's victory is more important than an opponent's victory, setting one's own trap is of higher priority than blocking the opponent's trap. Our prioritized list of rules then becomes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Win</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Block</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Prevent a trap</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create a trap</p></li></ul></div></div>
