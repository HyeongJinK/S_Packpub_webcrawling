Why are they so quiet? The answer is in the <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span>, where both sound effects have been marked as <span class="strong"><strong>3D Sound</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_10_15.jpg" /></div><p>Since Unity thinks <a id="id799" class="indexterm"></a>these are 3D sounds, the sounds will be quieter the further away the camera is from the audio sources attached to our objects. You can test this by<a id="id800" class="indexterm"></a> moving the camera in closer to where the objects land.</p><p>To let Unity know we want these sounds to play at a consistent volume regardless of their proximity to the camera, we have to uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>3D Sound</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Import Settings</strong></span>, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> to make sure the change was registered. Do this for all of the sounds in the <code class="literal">SFX</code> folder.</p><p>After you make this change, test your game again. The sounds will be noticeably louder.</p></div>
