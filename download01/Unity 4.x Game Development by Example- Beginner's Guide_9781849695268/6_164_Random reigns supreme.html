With random numbers, you can make sure every card deal is different, like you've just done with your <span class="strong"><strong>Robot Repair</strong></span> game. You can make enemies behave unpredictably, making it seem as though they're acting intelligently (without having to bother with complicated Artificial Intelligence programming! See <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch12">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Game #5 â€“Kisses 'n' Hugs</em></span>, for more on this technique.) You can make spaceships attack from surprising angles. You can build an avatar system with a <span class="strong"><strong>Shuffle</strong></span> button that randomly dresses up your player's character.</p><p>The best game developers use random numbers to make their games meatier, more visually appealing, and more fun! The <span class="emphasis"><em>worst</em></span> game developers use random numbers in all the wrong ways. Imagine a game where, whenever you shot a gun, the bullet traveled in a completely random direction! Random numbers can dramatically help or hinder your gameplay. Use them wisely, and they're an incredibly effective weapon in your game design arsenal.</p></div>
