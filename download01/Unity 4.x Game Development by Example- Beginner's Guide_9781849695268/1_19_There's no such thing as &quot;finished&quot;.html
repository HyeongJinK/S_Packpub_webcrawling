Some game developers who produce content for fixed media like game disks and cartridges are used to producing a "gold master"—the final build of the game—and calling it a day. One of the joys of deploying games to the web or mobile is that they're never truly finished. You can continue tweaking your web games and modifying them until you end up with a far more fun and polished game than you started with.</p><p>If you follow Flashbang Studios on Twitter or if you read the studio's blog, you'll see that it's constantly modifying and improving its games, even years after they were "finished". The Flashbang team continued to tweak and modify Off-Road Velociraptor Safari even three years after the game was finished.</p><p>Likewise, we'll be creating some games that are raw and unfinished at first. But as we learn more about how to program the crucial bits and pieces common to many games, we'll keep revisiting our rough, early games to add those pieces and improve them.</p></div>
