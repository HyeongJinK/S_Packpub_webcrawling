Unity consolidated them under one roof in their online Unity Asset Store. To access the store, open Unity 3D and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span>. Here are a few stand-out innovations that have seen a lot of use in the Unity community:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>2DToolkit</strong></span>: Prior to the release of Unity 4.3, creating 2D games in Unity was tough, but not impossible. Packages like 2DToolkit<a id="id1101" class="indexterm"></a> provided sprite sheet and texture packing systems to ease 2D development.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>NGUI</strong></span>: Another very popular package is NGUI,<a id="id1102" class="indexterm"></a> which does a great deal of GUI heavy lifting for you, using a more user-friendly system than Unity's built-in immediate mode GUI.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span><a id="id1103" class="indexterm"></a>: This snap-together system provides LEGO-like behavior blocks that you can link together; no programming required.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Asset packs</strong></span><a id="id1104" class="indexterm"></a>: There is a vast number of asset packages with everything from modeled airplanes to medieval dungeons that you can use to prototype your games. I strongly urge you to use whatever help you can to get your game finished. Paying $30 to save yourself months of work isn't cheatingâ€”it's just using your head. If it comes down to a choice between paying a few bucks and never finishing your game, it's time to break open your piggy bank.</p><p>The cats over at Unity Technologies aren't stupid. If they see a certain tool performing very well on the Unity Asset Store, it's a safe bet that they're planning to add it to a future release of Unity. That's why tools like NGUI and 2DToolkit see less use as their popularity peaks: Unity recreates or even hires the creators of these systems to improve their core product!</p></div>
