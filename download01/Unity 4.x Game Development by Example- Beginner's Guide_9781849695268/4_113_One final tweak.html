We want the paddle to angle in the opposite direction to keep the ball bouncing inside the play area. We can multiply by <code class="literal">-1</code> to flip the effect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var tiltAroundX : float = Input.GetAxis("Mouse Y") * tiltAngle * <span class="strong"><strong>-1</strong></span>;</pre></div><p>Save and test. Hooray! The paddle tilts around the play area inclusively, keeping the ball more or less within our reach—unless we get twitchy, and then we drop the ball. But that's the fun of keep-up—moving the paddle just so as to keep the ball in play.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec50"></a>What's a quaternion?</h3></div></div></div><p>Well, that was lots of fun!

A<a id="id341" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>quaternion</strong></span> (like the one we used in our rotation code just now) is a beast of a mathematical concept. According to my Mathematics Dictionary (which I often pull out for light reads in the bathroom), "a quaternion forms a four-dimensional normed division algebra over the real numbers".

But, we can't just go swiping code from the Script Reference without even partially understanding it, so let's give it the old college try.</p></div></div>
