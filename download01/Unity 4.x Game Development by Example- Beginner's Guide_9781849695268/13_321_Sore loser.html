If the human gets three Xs in a row, the computer will place an O even after the game is won. That's because our code is telling the computer to do this. We always call <code class="literal">ComputerTakeATurn</code> after the human's move, with no conditions.</p><p>Let's wrap our <code class="literal">ComputerTakeATurn</code> call in a conditional statement to check whether the game is won:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong> if(!gameIsOver)</strong></span>
  {
    yield WaitForSeconds(2);
    ComputerTakeATurn();
  }</pre></div><p>That should prevent the computer from getting in a cheater-pants cheap shot after the game has ended.</p></div>
