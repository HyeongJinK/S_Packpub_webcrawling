<span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> dynamics treat all of our objects as if they're made of wood, steel, or very stale cake. <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span> components tell Unity when game objects crash into each other. As both our <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> and our <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span> already have sphere- and cube-shaped colliders surrounding their meshes, the <a id="id227" class="indexterm"></a>missing link is the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component. By adding a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> component to the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span>, we include the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span> in Unity's physics<a id="id228" class="indexterm"></a> calculations. The result is hot ball-on-paddle action.</p></div>
