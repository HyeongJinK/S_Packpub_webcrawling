We're going to completely ignore the 3D world for this project and focus instead on the invisible 2D plane sitting in front of it. Imagine that your 3D world sits behind a sheet of glass. That sheet of glass is where the Unity GUI controls exist. We'll tack up buttons and images to that sheet of glass as if they're stickers that the player can interact with.</p></div>
