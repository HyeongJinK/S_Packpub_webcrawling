Here's what we found out:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Massive 80-person teams, all the way down to tiny one- or two-person teams are using Unity to create fun games.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>By thinking small, we'll have more success in learning Unity and producing fully functional games instead of huge but half-baked abandoned projects.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Different flavors of Unity help us deploy our games to different platforms. By using the free version, we can deploy to the web, and to Mac, PC, Linux, and certain mobile platforms.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The Unity interface has controls and panels that let us visually compose our game assets, and test games on the fly right inside the program!</p></li></ul></div><p>I hope you've taken some time to thoroughly vandalize the Angry Bots Demo. If you save the file by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Project</strong></span>, you'll have a perma-upside-down space marine in your Demo. If you want to return to a pristine AngryBots Demo later to wreak more havoc, don't bother saving the hilarious (but meaningless) changes we've made in this chapter.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec25"></a>Big ambition, tiny games</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we've trashed the joint, let's take a quick trip through some game design theory. In the next chapter, we'll figure out the scope and scale of a game that a solo, beginner developer should actually tackle. Crack your knuckles and put on your favorite hat because you're about to dip yourself in awesome sauce.</p></div></div>
