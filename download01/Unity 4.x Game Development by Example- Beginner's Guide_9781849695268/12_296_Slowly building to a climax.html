We don't quite have the right elements in place to detect a win state, but we're going to spend the rest of the chapter getting there.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec115"></a>Have a go hero â€“ think it through</h3></div></div></div><p>Ask yourself: what does the code need to know in order to determine when a player has won? How would you go about figuring that out? Put the book down for a moment and puzzle through this question, because it's exactly the type of problem you'll face when you begin building your own games.</p><p>I strongly urge you not to keep reading at this point. This isn't like one of those kids' shows where the little Mexican girl says "flap your arms like a chicken, everybody!", and you just sit on your couch eating snacks like a slug. <span class="emphasis"><em>Actually</em></span> sit down and work out what it might take to determine a win condition in this game. When you've given it an honest shot (whether you think your solution is successful or not), come back to the book and work through the solution I devised, which is one of many possible solutions.</p></div></div>
