You've got a ball and a paddle. We're going to add a score counter, but that's just not going to cut it. We need a fun theme to hold the player's interest, and to set our Unity game apart from the rest.</p><p>How's this? Let's call the game <span class="strong"><strong>Ticker Taker</strong></span>. We'll replace the ball with a human heart, and the paddle with a pair of hands holding a teevee dinner tray. We'll string these bizarre elements together with a compelling story:</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mr. Feldman needs a heart transplant–stat–and there's no time to lose! Help Nurse Slipperfoot rush a still-beating human heart through the hospital hallways to the ER, while bouncing it on a dinner tray! Drop the heart, and it's lights out for Feldman!</em></span>
</p><p>With a simple story re-skin, we now have a time-limited life and death drama. Doesn't that sound more exciting than "bounce the ball on the paddle"? Which game would <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> rather play?</p><p>To pull this off, we need to import the assets package for this chapter. When the <span class="strong"><strong>Importing package</strong></span> dialog pops up,<a id="id614" class="indexterm"></a> leave everything selected and click the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_08_01.jpg" /></div></div>
