Pretty cool for such a small effort, but it won't do for a keep-up game.

One of the parameters, or options, is called <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>. Next to that, we see the label <span class="strong"><strong>None (Physic Material)</strong></span> (this text may be slightly cut off depending on your <a id="id230" class="indexterm"></a>screen resolutionâ€”to see the whole label, click-and-drag the left edge of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel to increase its width). There's a small circle with a dot in the middle next to the label that means we can pop open a selection window. What hidden wonders await us in that window?</p></div>
