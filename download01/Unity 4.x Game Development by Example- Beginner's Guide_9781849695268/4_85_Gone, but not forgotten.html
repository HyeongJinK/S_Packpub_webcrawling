Note that we could also have unchecked the checkbox in the <code class="literal">DisappearMe</code> Script component to temporarily disable it. The <code class="literal">DisappearMe</code> Script is no longer acting on <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span>, but we haven't deleted it. You should still be able to see it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. To delete it, click on the Script and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key on your keyboard, or <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>delete</em></span> if you're on a Mac. If you want to keep the Script around to remember what you did in this chapter, leave it be.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A Script for all seasons</strong></span>
</p><p>You may already have guessed that the <code class="literal">DisappearMe</code> Script is not exclusive to the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball </strong></span>GameObject. You can drag-and-drop the Script on top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Ball</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Paddle</strong></span>, or any other <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span><a id="id290" class="indexterm"></a> in your <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. As long as that <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> has a renderer component, the Script will work.</p></div></div>
