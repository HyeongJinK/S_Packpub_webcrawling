It all starts with an<a id="id417" class="indexterm"></a> <code class="literal">import</code> statement. If you read through the code addendum at the end of <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Code Comfort</em></span>, you'll remember that C# code requires <span class="strong"><strong>using</strong></span> declarations that tell Unity we'd like to certain chunks of the code base. The JavaScript keyword <code class="literal">import</code> is identical to the C# keyword <code class="literal">using</code>. We use it to tell Unity that we're accessing <code class="literal">System.Collections.Generic</code> chunk of code, which isn't normally available to us by default. Try typing <code class="literal">List&lt;&gt;</code> into your code without the <code class="literal">using</code> declaration. Then, add the <code class="literal">using</code> declaration and type <code class="literal">List&lt;&gt;</code> again. When we declare that we're using <code class="literal">System.Colletions.Generic</code>, we get access to a whole new bunch of stuff.</p><p>Why do we need access anyway? Because the generic <code class="literal">List</code> object we declare a little farther down requires it. But what the heck is a List? It's one in a family of datatypes called Collections, which includes its (perhaps) more well-known cousin, array.</p><p>If a variable is a bucket that can hold one thing, then an array is a bucket that can hold many things. Unity JavaScript has a class called <code class="literal">Array</code> that allows us to create these handy buckets-of-stuff.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_05_27.jpg" /></div><p>In fact, the Collections <a id="id418" class="indexterm"></a>family has many members, including Built-in Array, Generic List, ArrayList, Hashtable, Generic Dictionary, and 2D Array. Knowing which family member to call on for a given task is a matter of taste and experience. In this chapter, we'll be using two types of Collections: the Generic List, and the 2D Array. Let's start by looking at that Generic List:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>var aCards:List.&lt;Card&gt;; // We'll store all the cards we create in this List</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Just like the variables we've used previously, Generic Lists are typed. We can put any type we want inside those pointy brackets. The <code class="literal">aCards</code> Generic List is typed <code class="literal">Card</code>, so we can only ever put <code class="literal">Card</code> instances inside.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip25"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Generally speaking</strong></span>
</p><p>If a Generic List takes a specific type, why do we call it a <span class="emphasis"><em>Generic</em></span> List? "Generic" refers to the parameter we pass to the Collection. It can be (generically) anything we want it to be ... but once we declare it, it can only ever contain that type of thing.</p></div></div>
