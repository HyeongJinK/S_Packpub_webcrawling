We've <a id="id415" class="indexterm"></a>already seen some built-in Unity classes in the previous chapter: the <code class="literal">Renderer</code> class, the <code class="literal">Input</code> class, and so on. We're going to create our own class called <code class="literal">Card</code>. You guessed it, the <code class="literal">Card</code> class is going to represent the cards in the game.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Double-click to open the <span class="strong"><strong>GameScript</strong></span> script.</p></li><li><p>Add the following code to the script, beneath (and outside) the <code class="literal">Update</code> function:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>class Card extends System.Object</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>{</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  var isFaceUp:boolean = false;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  var isMatched:boolean = false;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  var img:String;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>   </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  function Card()</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  {</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    img = "robot";</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  }</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>}</strong></span>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>Just like the keyword <code class="literal">var</code> declares a variable, we use the keyword <code class="literal">class</code> to declare a class. Next comes the name of our class, <code class="literal">Card</code>. Finally, our <code class="literal">Card</code> class extends <code class="literal">System.Object</code>, which means that it inherits all of its stuff from the built-in <code class="literal">System.Object</code> class much the same way I inherited my fabulous good looks and my withered left knee that smells like almond bark.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip23"></a>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>System.Object</strong></span>
</p><p>What does it mean to inherit from <code class="literal">System.Object</code>? That class is like Adam/Alpha/the Big Bangâ€”it's the class from which (generally speaking) everything in Unity is derived. It's about as nondescript as anything can get. You can think of <code class="literal">System.Object</code> as being synonymous with "thing" or "stuff". Every single other <span class="emphasis"><em>thing</em></span> we build in Unity, including our Memory game's <code class="literal">Card</code> class, derives from this primordial ur-thing called <code class="literal">System.Object</code>.</p></div><p>In the next few lines, we will declare some variables that all <code class="literal">Card</code> instances must have. <code class="literal">isFaceUp</code> determines whether or not the card has been flipped. <code class="literal">isMatched</code> is a true or false (<span class="strong"><strong>boolean</strong></span>) flag that we'll set to true when the card has been matched with its partner. The <code class="literal">img</code> variable stores the name of the picture associated with this card.</p><p>The function called <code class="literal">Card</code> inside the class called <code class="literal">Card</code> is a special piece of code called the <span class="strong"><strong>constructor function</strong></span>. The constructor is the very first function that gets called, automatically, when we create a new <code class="literal">Card</code> instance. Unity knows which function is the constructor function because it has the same name as the class. The only thing that we're doing in the constructor function is setting the <code class="literal">img</code> variable to <span class="strong"><strong>robot</strong></span>.</p><p>Great! That's all we <a id="id416" class="indexterm"></a>need in our <code class="literal">Card</code> class for now. Let's create some important game variables off the top of the script.</p></div>
