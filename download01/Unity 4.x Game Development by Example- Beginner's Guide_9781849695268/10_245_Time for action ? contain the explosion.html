<span class="strong"><strong>Clean up</strong></span>
</p><p>I've kept my <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel neat and tidy by putting all of my Prefabs into a folder. I've done the same thing with my scripts, my materials, my models, and my dirty sweat socks. Because there's not a lot going on in this project, it may seem like wasted effort. Still, organizing assets into folders is a good habit to get into. It can save your sanity on larger projects.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695268/graphics/5268OT_10_06.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec99"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened – duped?</em></span>
</h3></div></div></div><p>We've almost duplicated the same process we followed to get the bomb working. Have you noticed? With both the bomb and the stein, we put an imported model into a <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span>, and we created a particle system and put it in its own <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span>. Then we created a script to move the bomb down the screen. We attached that script to the bomb. Then we dragged the bomb's explosion particle system into the <code class="literal">prefab</code> variable of its <span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span> component.</p><p>This is <a id="id764" class="indexterm"></a>all starting to sound familiar—too familiar. In fact, remember when we said earlier that programmers are always finding ways to do less work? We saw that if you type the same line of code twice, you may not be writing your code to be as maintenance-friendly as possible. The same holds true for this bomb/beer mug situation. If the bomb and the beer mug both need to do the exact same thing, why don't we make life easier for ourselves and use the same script for both?</p></div></div>
