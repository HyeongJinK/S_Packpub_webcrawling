Created in the free 3D software package Blender, it's essentially a square donut <a id="id1019" class="indexterm"></a>with the normals flipped so that it appears inside out.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note31"></a>Note</h3><p>What's a normal? Usually, only one side of a 3D object's faces is "painted" (which is why you can zoom into the inside of a 3D object and it seems to disappear). Normals determine which side of each individual mesh polygon is painted.</p></div><p>We're going to set up one camera to bounce up and down, as if the character is running, and send it flying through the hallway. Then we'll set that view as the background for our <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span>, which is aimed at the heart-and-tray action. By using <span class="strong"><strong>Depth</strong></span> as our <span class="strong"><strong>Clear Flags</strong></span> setting on the foreground camera, the background camera will show through the empty space to make it appear as though the player is running through the hallway.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Find the hallway model in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.
