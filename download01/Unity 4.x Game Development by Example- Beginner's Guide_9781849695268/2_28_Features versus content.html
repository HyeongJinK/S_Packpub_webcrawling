For example, they'll say, "I don't want to set my sights too high, so I'm going to make a game such as <span class="strong"><strong>Gran Turismo</strong></span>,<a id="id88" class="indexterm"></a> except with fewer cars," or "I want to make <span class="strong"><strong>Diablo III</strong></span><a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a> with smaller levels," or "I'm going to build <span class="strong"><strong>World of Warcraft</strong></span><a id="id90" class="indexterm"></a> with fewer classes and about half the items".</p><p>To understand why this approach is so dangerous we'll have to understand a little more about how games are put together. The two issues here are <span class="strong"><strong>features</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>content</strong></span>. All things being equal, a game with 50 levels has more <span class="strong"><strong>content</strong></span> than a game with 5 levels. The 50-level game has ten times more content, but both games have the same feature: levels. A role-playing game with twelve character classes has more content than a game with three character classes, but they both have the same feature: character classes.</p><p>So, while you may recognize that it's more work to build additional <span class="strong"><strong>content</strong></span> for a game, try to peer behind the curtain and recognize the number of <span class="strong"><strong>features</strong></span> that go into a game. Every feature that your game supports takes more work, and sometimes it's easier to build 20 different enemies for a game than to actually build the enemies <span class="strong"><strong>feature</strong></span>.</p></div>
