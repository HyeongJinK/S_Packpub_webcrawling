Since its release, Unity has made a huge splash in the game development world by offering a suite of tools that blew the lid off of 3D browser-based gaming, while making it easier for people without serious C-based programming knowledge to develop for once-unfathomable devices.</p><p>It's a complete clich√©, but practice really is the one thin line separating you from developing those big projects you put up in jars on the shelf at the beginning of the book. Start building a game with what you know. With each project, set a new attainable challenge for yourself. This book has taught you how to set lights in a flat-looking hallway environment. But you've heard this term "lightmap" when reading about 3D games and models. What's that all about? Well, why not build a new game using the skills you've already developed, and commit to incorporating one lightmapped object in it? When you finish the game, you'll have added one extra tool to your tool belt, and you'll have a new, finished game for your portfolio.</p><p>How do you make a skybox so that the corner seams are invisible? How do you make your player take damage when he steps in lava? What's normal mapping? How do you program an enemy to follow and shoot at the player? How do you create your own models, textures, and animations? How do you put a different hat, gun, or pair of pants on a character model? How do you detect when one GameObject is near another, without colliding?</p><p>With each new thing you want your game to do, you'll come up with a question. Too many questions could discourage you and sink your ship before it even gets out to sea. Pick one thing and lock onto it with your laser scope. Do whatever it takes to discover the answer to your question, the solution to your problem, and build that solution into your game. Problem solved. Dragon slain. Checkbox checked. You will slay many dragons/cuddle many kittens in your journey as a game developer, but there's no need to take on the entire dragon/kitten army all at once. Take it one step at a time.</p><p>Be sure to check out the resources listed at the end of the book for places to turn to when you're stuck. You can also use that section to source new information when you're ready to add new tools to your tool belt.</p></div>
