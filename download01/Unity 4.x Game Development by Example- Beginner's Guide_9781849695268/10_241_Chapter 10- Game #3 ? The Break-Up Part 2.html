<span class="emphasis"><em>When last we left our put-upon protagonist, he had been kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend, who began throwing lit bombs at him from the fourth floor. Luckily, our hero is bizarrely invulnerable to bombs, and what's more, he can defy the laws of physics by balancing those bombs on his nose. Clearly, we've got some work ahead of us if we want this game to make any sense.</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>As we continue to round out The Break-Up, we'll add the beer steins and their smash animations. We'll write a collision detection script to make the character react when he catches things. We'll learn how to save time by using one script for two different objects. Then we'll add some sound effects to the game, and we'll figure out how to throw a random number to play different sounds for the same action. Let's get gaming.</em></span>
