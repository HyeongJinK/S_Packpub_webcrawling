After reviewing their parameters, we can summarize their roles as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>UI Root</strong></span> holds the UI and scales it for pixel perfect or fixed sizes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> views the UI and sends messages to the widgets for interactions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span> can attach elements to the borders of screen or objects and add offsets</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Panel</strong></span> holds our widgets and renders them, with or without clipping</p></li></ul></div><p>We are now ready to create our first widget. It's time to move on to the next chapter.</p></div>
