There are many more components, and the purpose of this chapter is to discuss these components. We will use the most important ones in this chapter. It is possible to add a component to any kind of widgetâ€”considering it is logical of course.</p><p>This component-oriented structure makes NGUI extremely flexible and modular. We will start by making our main menu a draggable window.</p></div>
