We also used NGUI's notification event system to change variables in code and register the user's choices.</p><p>We used <span class="strong"><strong>UIAnchors</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>UIStretch</strong></span> components to properly position our widgets—we just have to move each box's background sprite to move the entire element. This is much more effective than having to move each GameObject manually! You should have a main menu that looks like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783558667/graphics/8667OT_02_20.jpg" /></div><p>Ok, now it is time to enhance our UI experience and make this better.
