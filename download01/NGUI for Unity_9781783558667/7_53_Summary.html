Rigidbodies and colliders have been added to handle collisions between enemies in the barriers at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>We also added a health bar widget that is linked to health points; if four enemies touch the end of the screen, the game restarts.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Update()</code> method was used to handle player input and compare the typed word with destruct codes in order to destroy enemies if needed.</p><p>For now, the game is quite simple. Some ideas to enhance the game are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add more self-destruct words</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Display what the player types on the screen (visual feedback)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Slowly increase the spawning rate as the player destroys enemies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Slowly increase the enemy's speed as the player destroys enemies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add a scoring system</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implement the Time power (hint: Time.timeScale)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implement the Bomb power</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Make the hack time depend on barrierCount (more barriers, faster hacking)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Include the possibility of removing an ActiveBarrier with a right click</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add clickable objects to regain health; some enemies leave them behind</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add a combo reward if the player destroys multiple enemies within 3 seconds</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Include harder words for hard difficulty</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Insert a visual indicator (arrow) to show the direction of the enemies outside the screen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add more visual variety in the background (galaxies and so on) to help orientation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Display a game over screen with the main menu and restart buttons</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create tutorial pop ups</p></li></ul></div><p>If you add some of the previous features, our game will become more interesting.</p><p>In order to improve your knowledge of NGUI, you can refer to more tutorials at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tasharen.com/forum/index.php?topic=6754" target="_blank">http://www.tasharen.com/forum/index.php?topic=6754</a>.</p><p>The complete NGUI scripting documentation is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tasharen.com/ngui/docs/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.tasharen.com/ngui/docs/index.html</a>.</p><p>That's it! We have now finished working with Unity and NGUI using this book. Thank you for your attention and I wish you all the best for your future projects.</p></div>
