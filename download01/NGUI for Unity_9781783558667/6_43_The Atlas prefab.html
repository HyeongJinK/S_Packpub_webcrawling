It is<a id="id264" class="indexterm"></a> composed of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A large texture file containing all sprites and fonts</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A material with this texture file assigned, and a specific shader</p></li></ul></div><p>The Atlas prefab has a <span class="strong"><strong>UIAtlas</strong></span> component attached to it. Its purpose is to contain information about your sprites' positions and sizes in the large texture.</p><p>It is much more efficient to use only one large texture that holds all our sprites, instead of having separate multiple small textures.</p></div>
