Then, we created and configured a drag-and-drop system to select which power we want using the <span class="strong"><strong>UIDrag Object</strong></span> component and the custom code.</p><p>Remember to use the <span class="strong"><strong>UIGrid</strong></span> component often to automatically align objects—they are very powerful when used wisely with <span class="strong"><strong>UIAnchor</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>UIStretch</strong></span> components.</p><p>Using Unity's animations and NGUI's Tweens are no longer a secret for us—we used them to create a smooth apparition for these powers, and we combined them with Clipping to hide/show our Options menu.</p><p>Finally, we created scrollable text and learned how to use the Localization System to set up multiple languages.</p><p>We can now take a look at using C# with NGUI in the next chapter and see what we can accomplish using code.</p></div>
