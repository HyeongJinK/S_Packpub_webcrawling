<div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05"></a>Chapter 5. Building a Scrollable Viewport</h2></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will create a new scene and build a functional scrollable viewport in which we can drop objects that will stick to it. We will add interesting features such as scroll bars and keyboard scrolling with arrows.</p><p>This scrollable viewport<a id="id230" class="indexterm"></a> will be the base of our game from the previous chapter. So, from here, the user will become the player. The idea is that the player can scroll and<a id="id231" class="indexterm"></a> drag barriers on a viewport, which will take a few seconds to build. Enemies will come down from the top of the screen. If an enemy touches a barrier, he or she will be destroyed along with the barrier—but we will deal with enemies in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a Game with NGUI.</em></span>
</p><p>The more barriers there are on the scene, the longer the building process will be for the future barriers— this is the same idea with the barriers' cooldown.</p></div>
