We've come a long way in this chapter, from a blank project to an effective 2D game in which a player character can navigate a complete 2D environment with 2D Physics. The character can move left and right and jump, and the sprite texture will change to match the direction of travel as well. In addition, Sprite Packing has been used to optimize runtime performance, which is ideal for mobile devices. In the next chapter, we'll continue working by adding obstacles, collectable objects, and more!</p></div>
