We've now completed the 2D adventure game. Some minor details were not covered in this chapter for the sake of clarity and conciseness because we've seen the methods or content already in earlier chapters. Hence, it's important to open the course files and check out the completed project, seeing how the code works. Overall, in having reached this far in the book, you have three completed Unity projects to your name. So, in the next chapter, we'll wrap up everything that we've seen so far and get started on the grand finale: the final, fourth project!</p></div>
