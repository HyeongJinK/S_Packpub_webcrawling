This represents the starting point for any game development project and is the place where development begins. The newly created project contains nothing initially: no meshes, textures, or any other <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span>. You can confirm this by simply checking the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel area at the bottom of the editor interface. This panel displays the complete contents of the project folder, which corresponds to an actual folder on your local drive created earlier by the project wizard. This folder should be empty. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.5</em></span>. This panel will later be populated with more items, all of which we can use to build a game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.5: The Unity project panel docked at the bottom of the interface</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>If your interface looks radically different from <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.5</em></span>, in terms of its layout and arrangement, then you can reset the UI layout to its defaults. To do this, click on the <a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> drop-down menu from the top-right corner of the editor interface, and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.6</em></span>.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.6: Switching to the default interface layout</p></div></div><p>You can view the contents of your project folder directly via either Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, by right-clicking the mouse in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel from the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Editor</strong></span> to reveal a context menu, and <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>from there, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Show in Explorer</strong></span> (Windows) or <span class="strong"><strong>Reveal in Finder</strong></span> (Mac) option. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.7</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.7: Displaying the project folder via the Project panel</p></div></div><p>Clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Show in Explorer</strong></span> displays the folder contents in the default system file browser. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.8</em></span>. This view is useful to inspect files, count them, or back them up. However, don't change the folder contents manually this way via Explorer or Finder. Specifically, don't move, rename, or delete files from here, because doing so can corrupt your Unity project irretrievably. Instead, delete and move files where needed within the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel in the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Editor</strong></span>. This way, Unity updates its metadata as appropriate, ensuring that your project continues to work properly.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.8: Viewing the Project panel from the OS file browser</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>Viewing <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>the project folder in the OS file browser will display additional files and folders not visible in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, such as <code class="literal">Library</code> and <code class="literal">ProjectSettings</code>, and maybe a <code class="literal">Temp</code> folder. Together, these are known as the project metadata. This is not directly a part of your project per se, but contains additional settings and preferences that Unity needs to work properly. These folders and their files should not be edited or changed.</p></div></div>
