We now have something playable insofar as we can run around and explore the environment in first-person mode. However, the environment could benefit from additional polish. Right now, for example, the floor meshes appear suspended in mid-air with nothing beneath them to offer support. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.50</em></span>. Further, it's possible to walk over the edge and fall into an infinite drop. So let's add some water beneath the floors to complement the scene as a complete environment.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_50.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.50: The world floor appears to float and have no support</p></div></div><p>To add water, we can use another ready-made Unity asset included in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Open the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> | <code class="literal">Environment</code> | <code class="literal">Water</code> | <code class="literal">Water</code> | <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder. Then drag and drop <a id="id74" class="indexterm"></a>the <code class="literal">WaterProDaytime</code> asset from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel in the scene. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.51</em></span>. This appears as a circular object, which is initially smaller than needed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_51.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.51: Adding water to the environment</p></div></div><p>After adding the <code class="literal">Water</code> prefab, position it below the floor level and use the scale tool (R) to increase its planar size (<span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>) to fill the environment outward into the distant horizon. This creates the <a id="id75" class="indexterm"></a>feel that the floor meshes are smaller islands within an expansive world of water. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.52</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_52.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.52: Scaling and sizing water for the environment</p></div></div><p>Now let's take another test run in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab. Press play on the toolbar and navigate the character around in first-person mode. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.53</em></span>. You should see the water in the level. Of course, you can't walk on the water! Neither can you swim or dive beneath it. If you try walking on it, you'll simply fall through it, descending into infinity as though the water had never been there. Right now, the water is an entirely cosmetic feature, but it makes the scene look much better.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_53.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Testing the environment with water in FPS mode</p></div></div><p>The water is really a substanceless, ethereal object through which the player can pass easily. Unity doesn't recognize it as a solid or even a semi-solid object. As we'll see in more detail later, you can make an object solid very quickly by attaching a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> component to it. Colliders and physics is covered in more depth from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Project B â€“ the Space Shooter</em></span> onward. For now, however, we can add solidity to the water by first selecting the <a id="id76" class="indexterm"></a>
<code class="literal">Water</code> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel (or in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> viewport) and then by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> from the application menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.54</em></span>. Attaching a component to the selected object changes the object itself; it changes how it behaves. Essentially, components add behavior and functionality to objects, making them behave in different ways. Even so, resist the temptation to add lots of components to an object without reason and with the view that it makes them more versatile or powerful. It's better to have as few components on an object as necessary. This strategy of preferring relevant simplicity keeps your workflow neater, simpler, and optimized.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_54.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.54: Attaching a Box Collider to a Water object</p></div></div><p>When a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> is added to the water, a surrounding green cage or mesh appears. This <a id="id77" class="indexterm"></a>approximates the volume and shape of the <code class="literal">Water</code> object and represents its physical volume, namely, the volume of the object that Unity recognizes as solid. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.55</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_55.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.55: Box Colliders approximate physical volume</p></div></div><p>If you play the game now, your character will walk on water as opposed to falling through. True, the character should be able to swim properly, but walking might be better than falling. To achieve full swimming behavior would require significantly more work and is not covered here. If you want to remove the <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> functionality and return the water back to its original, ethereal state, then select the <code class="literal">Water</code> object, click on the cog icon on the <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> <a id="id78" class="indexterm"></a>component, and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Component</strong></span> from the context menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.56</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_56.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.56: Removing a component</p></div></div></div>
