On reaching this point, you've completed the coin collection game as well as your first game in Unity. On achieving this, you've seen a wide range of Unity features including level editing and design, prefabs, particle systems, meshes, components, script files, and build settings. That's a lot! Of course, there's a lot more to be said and explored for all these areas, but nevertheless, we've pulled them together to make a game. Next, we'll get stuck in with a different game altogether and, in doing this, we'll see a creative reuse of the same features as well as the introduction of completely new features. In short, we're going to move from the world of beginner-level Unity development to intermediate.</p></div>
