On reaching this point, you have laid the foundations for a coin collection game that will be complete and functional in the next chapter. Here, we've seen how to create a Unity project from scratch and populate it with assets, such as meshes, textures, and scenes. In addition, we've seen how to create a scene for our game and use a range of assets to populate it with useful functionality that ships out of the box with the Unity engine, such as water, first-person controllers, and environment prototyping assets. In the next chapter, we'll resume work from where we ended here by making a coin that is collectible, and establishing a set of rules and logic for the game, making it possible to win and lose.</p></div>
