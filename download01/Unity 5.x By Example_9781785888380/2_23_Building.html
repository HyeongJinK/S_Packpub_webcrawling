That is, to compile and package the game into a standalone and self-executing form, which the gamer can run and play without needing to use the Unity Editor. Typically, when developing games, you'll reach a decision about your target platform (such as Windows, iOS, Android, and others) during the design phase and not at the end of development. It's often said that Unity is a 'develop once, deploy everywhere tool. This slogan can conjure up the unfortunate image that, after a game is made, it'll work just as effortlessly on every platform supported by Unity as it does on the desktop.</p><p>Unfortunately, things are not so simple; games that work well on desktop systems don't necessarily perform equally well on mobiles and vice versa. This is largely due to the great differences in target hardware and industry standards that hold between them. Due to these differences, I'll focus our attention here to the Windows and Mac desktop platforms, ignoring mobiles and consoles and other platforms. To <a id="id164" class="indexterm"></a>create a Build for desktop platform, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_36.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.36: Accessing the Build Settings for the project</p></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog is displayed and its interface consists of three main areas. The <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> list is a complete list of all scenes to be included in the build, regardless of whether the gamer will actually visit them in the game. It represents the totality of all scenes that could ever be visited in the game. In short, if you want or need a scene in your game, then it needs to be in <a id="id165" class="indexterm"></a>this list. Initially, the list is empty. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.37</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_37.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.37: The Build Settings dialog</p></div></div><p>You can easily add scenes to the list by simply dragging and dropping the scene asset from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> list. For the coin collection game, I'll drag and drop the <code class="literal">Level_01</code> scene to the list. As scenes are added, Unity automatically assigns them a number, depending on their order in the list. <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> represents the topmost item, 1 the next item, and so on. This number is important insofar as the <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> item is concerned. The topmost scene (scene 0) will always be the starting scene. That is, when the build runs, Unity automatically <a id="id166" class="indexterm"></a>begins execution from scene 0. Thus, scene 0 will typically be your splash or intro scene. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.38</em></span>, Adding a level to the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_38.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.38: Adding a level to the Build Settings dialog</p></div></div><p>Next, be sure to select your target platform from the <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> list at the bottom left-hand side of the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog. For desktop platforms, choose <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span>, which should be selected by default. Then, from the options, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Target Platform</strong></span> drop-down list to either <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Linux</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS X</strong></span>, depending on your system. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.39</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_39.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.39: Choosing a target build platform</p></div></div><p>If you've previously been testing your game for multiple platforms or trying out other platforms such as <span class="strong"><strong>Android</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button (at the bottom left of the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog) might become active when you select the <span class="strong"><strong>Standalone</strong></span> option. If it does, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch </strong></span>
<a id="id167" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> button to confirm to Unity that you intend building for the selected platform. On clicking this, Unity may spend a few minutes configuring your assets for the selected platform:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_40.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.40: Switching platforms</p></div></div><p>Before building for the first time, you'll probably want to view the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> options to fine-tune <a id="id168" class="indexterm"></a>important build parameters, such as game resolution, quality settings, executable icon, and information, among other settings. To access the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span>, you can simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> dialog. This displays the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. The same settings can also be accessed via the application menu by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.4</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_41.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.41: Accessing the Player Settings options</p></div></div><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span> options, set <span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span> as this information is baked and stored within the built executable. You can also specify an icon image for the executable as <a id="id169" class="indexterm"></a>well as a default mouse cursor, if one is required. For the collection game, however, these latter two settings will be left empty. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.42</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_42.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.42: Setting a publisher name and product name</p></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution and Presentation</strong></span> tab is especially important as it specifies the game screen size and whether a default splash screen (<span class="strong"><strong>Resolution</strong></span> dialog) should appear at the application startup. From this tab, ensure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Is Full Screen</strong></span> option is enabled, meaning that the <a id="id170" class="indexterm"></a>game will run at the complete size of the system's screen as opposed to a smaller and movable window. In addition, enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Display Resolution Dialog</strong></span> drop-down list. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.43</em></span>. When this is enabled, your application will display an options screen at startup, allowing the user to select a target resolution and screen size and customize controls. For a final build, you'll probably want to disable this option, presenting the same settings through your own customized options screen in-game instead. However, for test builds, the <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution</strong></span> dialog can be a great help. It lets you test your build easily at different sizes.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_43.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.43: Enabling the Resolution dialog</p></div></div><p>Now you're ready to make your first compiled build. So, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> dialog or else, choose <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build &amp; Run</strong></span> from the application menu. When you do this, Unity presents you with a <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> dialog, asking you to specify a target location on your computer <a id="id171" class="indexterm"></a>where the build should be made. Select a location and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>, and the build process will be completed. Occasionally, this process can generate errors, which are printed in red in the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window. This can happen, for example, when you save to a read-only drive, have insufficient hard drive space, or don't have the necessary administration privileges on your computer. However, generally, the build process succeeds if your game runs properly in the editor. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.44</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_44.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.44: Building and running a game</p></div></div><p>After the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> is completed, Unity generates new files at your destination location. For Windows, it generates an <a id="id172" class="indexterm"></a>executable file and data folder. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.45</em></span>. Both are essential and interdependent. That is, if you want to distribute your game and have other people play it without needing to install Unity, then you'll need to send users both the executable file and associated data folder and all its contents.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_45.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.45: Unity builds several files</p></div></div><p>On running your game, the <span class="strong"><strong>Resolution</strong></span> dialog will show, assuming that you <span class="strong"><strong>Enabled</strong></span> the <span class="strong"><strong>Display Resolution </strong></span>
<a id="id173" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Dialog</strong></span> option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Player Settings</strong></span>. From here, users can select the game resolution, quality, and output monitor and configure player controls:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_46.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.46: Preparing to run your game from the Resolution dialog</p></div></div><p>On clicking the play button, your game will run by default in fullscreen mode. Congratulations! Your <a id="id174" class="indexterm"></a>game is now completed and built and you can send it to your friends and family for play testing! See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.47</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_47.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.47: Running the coin collection game in fullscreen mode</p></div></div><p>But wait! How do you exit your game when you're finished playing? There's no quit button or main menu <a id="id175" class="indexterm"></a>option in the game. For Windows, you just need to press <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F4</em></span> on the keyboard. For Mac, you press <span class="emphasis"><em>cmd</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span> and for Ubuntu, it's <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span>.</p></div>
