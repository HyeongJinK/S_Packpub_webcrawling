One of them is that the player doesn't seem to face the position of the mouse cursor, even though our code is designed to achieve this behavior. The reason is that the camera, by default, is not configured as it needs to be for a top-down 2D game. We'll fix this in this section. To get started, the scene camera should have a top-down view of the scene. To achieve this, switch the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> viewport to a top-down 2D view by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>ViewCube</strong></span>, the up arrow in the top right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> viewport. This switches your viewport to a top view. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.17</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_17.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.17: The viewcube can change the viewport perspective</p></div></div><p>You can see <a id="id196" class="indexterm"></a>that the viewport is in a top view because the viewcube will list <span class="strong"><strong>Top</strong></span> as the current view. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.18</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_18.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.18: Top view in the Scene viewport</p></div></div><p>From here, you can have the scene camera conform to the viewport camera exactly, giving you an instant top-down view for your game. To do this, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> (or from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel) and then choose <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Align With View</strong></span> from the application menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.19</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_19.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.19: Aligning the camera to the Scene viewport</p></div></div><p>This makes your <a id="id197" class="indexterm"></a>game look much better than before, but there's still a problem. When the game is running, the spaceship still doesn't look at the mouse cursor as intended. This is because the camera is a <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> camera and the conversion between a screen point and world point is leading to unexpected results. We can fix this by changing the camera to an <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> camera, which is a truly 2D camera that allows no perspective distortion. To do this, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> in the scene, and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Projection</strong></span> setting from <span class="strong"><strong>Perspective</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_20.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.20: Changing the Camera to Orthographic mode</p></div></div><p>Every orthographic camera has a <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, which is not present for perspective cameras. This field controls how many units in the world view correspond to pixels on the screen. We want a 1:1 ratio or relationship between world units to pixels in order to ensure that our textures appear at the correct size and cursor movement has the intended effect. The <a id="id198" class="indexterm"></a>target resolution for our game will be Full HD, which is 1920 x 1080, and this has an aspect ratio of 16:9. For this resolution, the orthographic <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> should be <code class="literal">5.4</code>. The reasons for this value are beyond the scope of this book, but the formula to arrive at it is <span class="emphasis"><em>screen height (in pixels) / 2 / 100</em></span>. Therefore, <span class="emphasis"><em>1080 / 2 / 100 = 5.4</em></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.21</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_21.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.21: Changing orthographic size for a 1:1 pixel-to-screen ratio</p></div></div><p>Finally, make sure that your <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab view is configured to display the game at a <span class="strong"><strong>16:9</strong></span> aspect ratio. If it isn't, click on the aspect drop-down list at the top left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view and choose the <span class="strong"><strong>16:9</strong></span> option. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.22</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_22.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.22: Displaying the game at a 16:9 aspect ratio</p></div></div><p>Now try running the game, and you have a player spaceship that moves based on WASD input and also turns to face the mouse cursor. Great work! See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.23</em></span>. The game is really taking <a id="id199" class="indexterm"></a>shape. However, there's lots more work to do.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_23.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.23: Turning to face the cursor!</p></div></div></div>
