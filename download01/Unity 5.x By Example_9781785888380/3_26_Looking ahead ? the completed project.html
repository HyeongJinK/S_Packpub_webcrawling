See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.1</em></span>. The game to be created will contain one scene only. In this scene, the player controls a spaceship that can shoot oncoming enemies. The directional keyboard arrows, and WASD, move the spaceship around the level, and it will always turn to face the mouse pointer. Clicking the left mouse button will fire ammo.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_01.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.1: The completed twin-stick shooter game</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>The completed <code class="literal">TwinStickShooter</code> project, as discussed in this chapter and the next, can be found in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter03/TwinStickShooter folder</code>.</p><p>Most assets for this game (including sound and textures) were sourced from the freely accessible site, <a class="ulink" href="http://OpenGameArt.org" target="_blank">OpenGameArt.org</a>.
