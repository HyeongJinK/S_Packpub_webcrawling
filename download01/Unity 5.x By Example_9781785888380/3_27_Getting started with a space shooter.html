Details about creating new projects can be found in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Coin Collection Game â€“ Part 1</em></span>. We'll be coding everything from scratch this time around. Once a project is generated, create some basic folders to structure and organize the project assets from the outset. This is very important to keep track of your files as you work. Create folders for <code class="literal">Textures</code>, <code class="literal">Scenes</code>, <code class="literal">Materials</code>, <code class="literal">Audio</code>, <code class="literal">Prefabs</code>, and <code class="literal">Scripts</code>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.2</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_02.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.2: Create folders for structure and organization</p></div></div><p>Next, our game will depend on some graphical and audio assets. These are included in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter03/Assets</code> folder, but can also be downloaded online from <a class="ulink" href="http://OpenGameArt.org" target="_blank">OpenGameArt.org</a>. Let's start with textures for the player spaceship, enemy spaceships, and star-field background. Drag and drop <code class="literal">Textures</code> from Windows Explorer or Finder to the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel in the <code class="literal">Textures</code> folder. Unity imports and configures the <a id="id179" class="indexterm"></a>textures automatically. <span class="emphasis"><em>See Figure 3.3</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_03.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.3: Importing Texture assets for the spaceship, enemies, star background, and ammo</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>Use of the provided assets is optional. You can create your own if you prefer. Just drag and drop your own textures in place of the included assets, and you can still follow along with the tutorial just fine.</p></div><p>By default, Unity imports image files as regular textures for use on 3D objects, and it assumes that their pixel dimensions are a power-2 size (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and so on). If the size is not actually one of these, then Unity will up-scale or down-scale the texture to the nearest valid size. This is not appropriate behavior, however, for a 2D top-down space shooter game in which imported textures should appear at their native (imported) size without any scaling or automatic adjustment. To fix this, select all the imported textures and, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, change their <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> from <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>. Once changed, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button to update the settings and the <a id="id180" class="indexterm"></a>textures will retain their imported dimensions. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.4</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_04.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.4: Changing the Texture type for imported textures</p></div></div><p>After changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> setting to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>, also remove the check mark from the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> box, in case this box is enabled. This will prevent Unity from automatically downgrading the quality of textures based on their distance from the camera in the scene. This ensures that your textures retain their highest quality. More information on <a id="id181" class="indexterm"></a>2D texture settings and Mip Maps can be found at the online Unity documentationat <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html</a>. <span class="emphasis"><em>See Figure 3.5</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_05.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.5: Removing MipMapping from imported textures</p></div></div><p>Now you can easily drag and drop your textures to the scene adding them as sprite objects. You can't drag and drop them from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the viewport, but you can drag and drop them from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. When you do this, the texture will automatically be added as a sprite object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. We'll make frequent use of this <a id="id182" class="indexterm"></a>feature as we work at creating spaceship objects. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.6</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_06.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.6: Adding sprites to the scene</p></div></div><p>Next, let's import music and sound effects, which are also included in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter03/Assets/Audio</code> folder. These assets were downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://OpenGameArt.org" target="_blank">OpenGameArt.org</a>. To import the audio, simply drag and drop the files from Windows Explorer or Mac Finder to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. When you do this, Unity automatically imports and configures the assets. You can give the audio a test from within the Unity <a id="id183" class="indexterm"></a>Editor by pressing play on the preview toolbar from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.7</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_07.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.7: Previewing audio from the Object Inspector</p></div></div><p>As with texture files, Unity imports audio files using a set of default parameters. These parameters are typically suitable for short sound effects such as footsteps, gunshots, and explosions, but for longer tracks such as music, they can be problematic, causing long level-loading times. To fix this, select the music track in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, disable the <span class="strong"><strong>Preload Audio Data</strong></span> checkbox. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Load Type</strong></span> drop-down box, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Streaming</strong></span> option. This ensures that the music track is streamed as opposed to loaded wholly in memory at level startup. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.8</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_08.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.8: Configuring music tracks for streaming</p></div></div></div>
