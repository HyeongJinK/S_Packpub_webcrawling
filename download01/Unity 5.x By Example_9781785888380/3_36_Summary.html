The space shooter is really taking shape now, featuring a controllable player character that relies on native physics, twin-stick mechanics, enemy ships, and a scene-wide spawner for enemies. All these ingredients together still don't make a game: we can't shoot, we can't increase the score, and we can't destroy enemies. These issues will need to be addressed, along with other technical issues that we'll certainly encounter. Nevertheless, we now have a solid foundation for moving further, and in <a id="id234" class="indexterm"></a>the next chapter, we'll complete the shooter.</p></div>
