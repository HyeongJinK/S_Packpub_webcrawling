This project, unlike the previous three, will not be a fully completed game with a clear win and loss condition but will be a functional prototype and <span class="emphasis"><em>proof of concept</em></span> style project that highlights a range of important coding techniques and ideas prevalent in games. Specifically, we'll create a world with a terrain, first-person character, and some enemies. The enemies will <a id="id415" class="indexterm"></a>have <span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>), patrol the level searching for the player, and attack the player when found. In this chapter, we will explore the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to build levels and landscapes with the Terrain tools</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to generate and use navigation meshes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How to prepare for Artificial Intelligence development</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"></a>Note</h3><p>The starting project and assets can be found in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter07/Start</code> folder.
