The details on this are covered amply in all previous chapters. Throughout this project, we'll be using three main asset packages included with Unity. Specifically, these are Characters, Effects, and Environment. These can be imported via the application menu, through <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Packages</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.2</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_07_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.2: Importing asset packages</p></div></div><p>To start, we'll need to create the game world itself (the terra firma), which will be an outdoor (exterior) environment. In other words, we'll create a game world with grassy plains, hills, and <a id="id418" class="indexterm"></a>mountains. Such a landscape can be made in 3D modeling software, such as 3DS Max, Maya, or Blender, and then imported to Unity. However, Unity features native terrain design tools that, though limited in important ways (as we'll see), are still powerful and versatile. To create a new terrain, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> from the application menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.3</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_07_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.3: Creating a new terrain</p></div></div><p>Once created, a terrain object is added to the scene at the world origin (0,0,0). It may not immediately appear in the <a id="id419" class="indexterm"></a>viewport due to its size. To address this, select the terrain in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then press <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> on the keyboard to center it in the view. It initially looks like a flat plane object but, unlike planes, it can be reshaped and sculpted, as we'll see soon. <span class="emphasis"><em>See Figure 7.4</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_07_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.4: A terrain is added to the scene</p></div></div><p>Before sculpting and shaping the terrain, you should first set some initial topological settings from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span> in order to ensure that terrain topology is appropriate and sized to support the <a id="id420" class="indexterm"></a>kind of terrain you need. To do this, select the terrain in the viewport, and then click on the cog icon from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span> to display the terrain settings. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.5</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_07_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.5: Viewing and editing the terrain settings</p></div></div><p>By default, the terrain is too large for most purposes (500 x 500 meters). Let's shrink this to 256 x 256, or even smaller, if you prefer! Simply enter <code class="literal">256</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Length</strong></span> fields. The <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> field represents the maximum height that any terrain peak or mountain can possibly reach. For optimization reasons, the terrain should be no larger than needed, as terrain <a id="id421" class="indexterm"></a>objects are highly tessellated <a id="id422" class="indexterm"></a>and performance-intensive. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.6</em></span>. Be sure to set the terrain dimensions before sculpting as resizing afterward can invalidate or erase sculpting work.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_07_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.6: Setting terrain resolution in width and length</p></div></div></div>
