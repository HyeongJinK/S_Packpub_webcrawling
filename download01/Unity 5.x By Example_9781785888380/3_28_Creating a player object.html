Creating this might seem a trivial matter of simply dragging and dropping the relevant player sprite from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the scene, but things are not so simple. The player is a complex object with many different behaviors, as we'll see. For this reason, more care needs to be taken about creating the player. To get started, create an empty game object in the scene by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span> from the application menu and name the object, <code class="literal">Player</code>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.9</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_09.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.9: Starting to create the player</p></div></div><p>The newly created object may or may not be centered at the world origin of <span class="emphasis"><em>(0, 0, 0)</em></span> and its rotation properties may not be consistently <code class="literal">0</code> across <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>. To ensure a completely zeroed transform, you could manually set the values to <code class="literal">0</code> by entering them directly in the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component for the object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. However, you can set them all to <code class="literal">0</code> automatically by clicking on the cog icon at the top left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span> from the context menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.10</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_10.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.10: Resetting the Transform component</p></div></div><p>Next, drag and drop the <code class="literal">Player</code> drop ship sprite (in the <code class="literal">Textures</code> folder) from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, making it a child of the empty player object. Then, rotate the drop ship sprite by <code class="literal">90</code> degrees in <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> and <code class="literal">-90</code> degrees in <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>. This makes the sprite oriented in the <a id="id185" class="indexterm"></a>direction of its parent's forward vector and also flattened on the ground plane. The game camera will take a top-down view. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.11</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_11.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.11: Aligning the Player ship</p></div></div><p>You can confirm that the ship sprite has been aligned correctly in relation to its parent by selecting the <code class="literal">Player</code> object and viewing the blue forward vector arrow. The front of the ship sprite and the blue forward vector should be pointing in the same direction. If they're not, then continue to rotate the sprite by 90 degrees until they're in alignment. This will be important later when coding player movement to make the ship travel in the direction it's looking. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.12</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_12.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.12: The blue arrow is called the forward vector</p></div></div><p>Next, the <code class="literal">Player</code> object should react to physics, that is, the <code class="literal">Player</code> object is solid and affected by physical forces. It must collide with other solids and also take damage from enemy ammo when <a id="id186" class="indexterm"></a>hit. To facilitate this, two additional components should be added to the <code class="literal">Player</code> object, specifically, a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span>. To do this, select the <code class="literal">Player</code> object (not the <code class="literal">Sprite</code> object) and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> from the application menu. Then, choose <code class="literal">Component</code> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule Collider</strong></span> from the menu. This adds both a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.13</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_13.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.13: Adding a Rigidbody and Capsule Collider to the Player object</p></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span> component is used to approximate the volume of the object and the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigibody</strong></span> component uses the <span class="strong"><strong>Collider</strong></span> to determine how physical forces should be applied realistically. Let's adjust <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule Collider</strong></span> a little because the default settings typically do not match up with the <code class="literal">Player</code> sprite as intended. Specifically, adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Direction</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> values until <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule</strong></span> encompasses the <code class="literal">Player</code> sprite and represents the <a id="id187" class="indexterm"></a>volume of the player. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.14</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_14.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.14: Adjusting the spaceship Capsule Collider</p></div></div><p>By default, the <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> component is configured to approximate objects that are affected by gravity and fall to the ground, bumping into and reacting to other solids in the scene. This is not appropriate for a spaceship that flies around. Consequently, the <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> should be adjusted. Specifically, remove the <span class="strong"><strong>Use Gravity</strong></span> check mark to prevent the object from falling to the ground. Additionally, enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Freeze Position</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> checkbox and the <span class="strong"><strong>Freeze Rotation</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> checkbox to prevent the spaceship moving and rotating around axes that are undesirable in a 2D top-down game. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 3.15</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_03_15.png.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.15: Configuring the Rigidbody component for the player spaceship</p></div></div><p>Excellent work! We've now configured the player spaceship object successfully. Of course, it still doesn't move or do anything specific in the game. This is simply because we haven't added any <a id="id188" class="indexterm"></a>code yet. That's something we'll turn to nextâ€”making the player object respond to user input.</p></div>
