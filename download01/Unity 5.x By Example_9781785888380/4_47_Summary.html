We're really on a roll now, having completed two solid Unity projects. The first project was a coin collection game and the second was a twin-stick shooter. Both are, ultimately, simple games in that they don't rely on advanced mechanics or display sophisticated features. However, even very sophisticated games, when boiled down to their fundamental ingredients, can be found to rest on a similar foundation of essential concepts such as the ones that we've covered so far. That's why our projects are so critical to understanding Unity in a deep way. Next, we'll move on to creating a more 2D-focused game, considering interfaces, sprites, and physics, and lots more!</p></div>
