This object was created by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span> from the application menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.1</em></span>. The coin object, as a concept, represents a basic or fundamental unit in our game logic because the player character should be actively searching the level looking for coins to collect before a timer runs out. This means that the coin is more than mere <span class="emphasis"><em>appearance</em></span>; its purpose in the game is not simply eye candy, but is functional. It makes an immense difference to the game outcome whether the coin is collected by the player or not. Therefore, the <a id="id84" class="indexterm"></a>coin object, as it stands, is lacking in two important respects. Firstly, it looks dull and greyâ€”it doesn't really stand out and grab the player's attention. Secondly, the coin cannot actually be collected yet. Certainly, the player can walk into the coin, but nothing appropriate <a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a>happens in response.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.1: The coin object so far</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>The completed <code class="literal">CollectionGame</code> project, as discussed in this chapter and the next, can be found in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter02/CollectionGame</code> folder.</p></div><p>In this section, we'll <a id="id86" class="indexterm"></a>focus on improving the coin appearance using a <span class="strong"><strong>material</strong></span>. A material defines an algorithm (or instruction set) specifying how the coin should be rendered. A material doesn't just say what the coin should look like in terms of color; it defines how shiny or smooth a surface is, as opposed to rough and diffuse. This is important to recognize and is why a texture and material refer to different things. A texture is simply an image file loaded in memory, which can be wrapped around a 3D object via its UV mapping. In contrast, a material defines how one or more textures can be combined together and applied to an object to shape its appearance. To create a new material asset in Unity, right-click on an empty area in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, and from the context menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.2</em></span>. You can also choose <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> <a id="id87" class="indexterm"></a>from the application menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.2: Creating a material</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>A material is sometimes called a <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span>. If needed, you can create custom materials using a <span class="strong"><strong>Shader Language</strong></span> or you can use a Unity add-on, such as <span class="strong"><strong>Shader Forge</strong></span>.</p></div><p>After creating a new material, assign it an appropriate name from the Project panel. As I'm aiming for a gold look, I'll name the material <code class="literal">mat_GoldCoin</code>. Prefixing the asset name with <code class="literal">mat</code> helps me know, just from the asset name, that it's a material asset. Simply type a new name in the <a id="id88" class="indexterm"></a>text edit field to name the material. You can also <a id="id89" class="indexterm"></a>click on the material name twice to edit the name at any time later. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.3</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.3: Naming a material asset</p></div></div><p>Next, select the material asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, if it's not already selected, and its properties display immediately in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. There are lots of properties listed! In addition, a material preview displays at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, showing you how the material would look, based on its current settings, if it were applied to a 3D object, such as a sphere. As you change material settings from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, the preview panel updates automatically to reflect your changes, offering instant feedback on how the material would look. See <a id="id90" class="indexterm"></a>the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.4: Material properties are changed from the Object Inspector</p></div></div><p>Let's now create a gold <a id="id91" class="indexterm"></a>material for the coin. When creating any material, the first setting to choose is the <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> type because this setting affects all other parameters available to you. The <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> type determines which algorithm will be used to shade your object. There are many different choices, but most material types can be approximated using either <span class="strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Standard (Specular setup)</strong></span>. For the gold coin, we can leave the <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> as <span class="strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span>. See the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.5: Setting the material Shader type</p></div></div><p>Right now, the preview panel displays the material as a dull grey, which is far from what we need. To define a <a id="id92" class="indexterm"></a>gold color, we must specify the <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo</strong></span>. To do this, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Albedo</strong></span> color slot to display a <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> picker, and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> picker dialog, select a <a id="id93" class="indexterm"></a>gold color. The material preview updates in response to reflect the changes. Refer to the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.6: Selecting a gold color for the Albedo channel</p></div></div><p>The coin material is looking better than it did, but it's still supposed to represent a metallic surface, which <a id="id94" class="indexterm"></a>tends to be shiny and reflective. To add this quality to our <a id="id95" class="indexterm"></a>material, click and drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Metallic</strong></span> slider in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span> to the right-hand side, setting its value to <code class="literal">1</code>. This indicates that the material represents a fully metal surface as opposed to a diffuse surface such as cloth or hair. Again, the preview panel will update to reflect the change. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.7</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.7: Creating a metallic material</p></div></div><p>We now have a gold material created, and it's looking good in the preview panel. If needed, you can change the kind of object used for a preview. By default, Unity assigns the created material to <a id="id96" class="indexterm"></a>a sphere, but other primitive objects are allowed, including cubes, cylinders, and torus. This helps you preview materials under different conditions. You can change objects by clicking on the geometry button directly above the preview panel to cycle through them. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.8</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.8: Previewing a material on an object</p></div></div><p>When your material is ready, you can assign it directly to meshes in your scene just by dragging and dropping. Let's assign the coin material to the coin. Click and drag the material from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> <a id="id97" class="indexterm"></a>panel to the coin object in the scene. On dropping the <a id="id98" class="indexterm"></a>material, the coin will change appearance. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.9</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_09.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.9: Assigning the material to the coin</p></div></div><p>You can confirm that material assignment occurred successfully and can even identify which material was assigned by selecting the <code class="literal">Coin</code> object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and viewing its <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component is responsible for making sure that a mesh object is actually visible in the scene when the camera is looking. The <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component contains a <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> field. This lists all materials currently assigned to the object. By clicking on the material name from the <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> field, Unity <a id="id99" class="indexterm"></a>automatically selects the material in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, making <a id="id100" class="indexterm"></a>it quick and simple to locate materials. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.10</em></span>, The <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component lists all materials assigned to an object:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_02_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.10: The Mesh Renderer component lists all materials assigned to an object</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>Mesh objects may have multiple materials with different materials assigned to different faces. For the best in-game performance, use as few unique materials on an object as <a id="id101" class="indexterm"></a>necessary. Make the extra effort to share materials across multiple objects, if possible. Doing so can significantly enhance the performance of your game. For more information on optimizing <a id="id102" class="indexterm"></a>rendering performance, see the online documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance.html</a>.</p></div><p>That's it! You now have a complete and functional gold material for the collectible coin. It's looking good. However, we're still not finished with the coin. The coin looks right, but it doesn't behave right. Specifically, it doesn't disappear when touched, and we don't yet keep track of how <a id="id103" class="indexterm"></a>many coins the player has collected overall. To address this, then, we'll need to script.</p></div>
