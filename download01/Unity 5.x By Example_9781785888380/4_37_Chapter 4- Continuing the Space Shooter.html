At this stage, we have a working game. At least, the gamer can control a spaceship using two axes: movement and rotation. WASD keys on the keyboard control movement (up, down, left, and right) and the mouse cursor controls rotation—the spaceship always rotates to face the cursor. In addition to player controls, the level features enemy characters that spawn at regular intervals, fly around the level, and move toward the player with hostile intent. Finally, both the player and enemies support a Health component, which means both are susceptible to damage and can be destroyed. Right now, however, the player lacks two important features: it cannot fire a weapon and it cannot increase the score. This chapter tackles these issues and more. Firing weapons, as we'll see, represents a particularly interesting problem. Overall, this chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Weapons and spawning ammo</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Memory management and pooling</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Sound and audio</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scoring</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Debugging and testing</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Building and distribution</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"></a>Note</h3><p>The completed project so far can be found in the book's companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter04/Start</code> folder.
