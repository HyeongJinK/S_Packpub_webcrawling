The process to do this is the same as detailed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Project A â€“ the Collection Game Continued</em></span>, to build the coin collection game. From the application menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>. From the build dialog, add our level to the level list by simply clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button. Otherwise, drag and drop the level from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the level list. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 4.50</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_04_50.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.50: Preparing to build the space shooter</p></div></div><p>For this game, the target platform will be Windows. Consequently, select the <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span> option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> list, if it's not selected already. If the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button (at the bottom left) is not disabled, then you will need to press this button, confirming to Unity that it should build for the selected platform as opposed to a different platform. Then, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build And Run</strong></span> button. On clicking this, Unity prompts you to select a folder on your computer where the built file will be output and saved. Once generated, double-click the executable to run it and test. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 4.51</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_04_51.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.51: Test running the game as a standard Windows executable</p></div></div></div>
