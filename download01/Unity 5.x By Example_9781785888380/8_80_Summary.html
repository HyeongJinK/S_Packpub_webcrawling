You've now reached the end of the AI project as well as the end of the book. In completing this project, you've assembled a complete terrain, an NPC prefab, and a series of scripts that work together strategically to create the appearance of intelligence, and this is <span class="emphasis"><em>good enough</em></span> for AI. For games, AI refers to nothing more than <span class="emphasis"><em>intelligent-looking</em></span> objects and the techniques that create them. Great! Furthermore, in reaching the end of this book and completing all four projects, you are now equipped with a varied and critically important skillset to develop professional-grade games in both 2D and 3D.</p></div>
