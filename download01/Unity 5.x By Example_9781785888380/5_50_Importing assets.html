The assets to import are included in the book companion files in the <code class="literal">Chapter05/Assets</code> folder. From here, select all textures together in Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, and drag and drop them to the Unity Project panel in a designated <code class="literal">Textures</code> folder. (Create one if you haven't already!). This imports all relevant textures to the active Project. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.3</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.3: Importing texture assets to the Project</p></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember that you can always use the Thumbnail Size Slider (at the bottom right corner of the Project panel) to adjust the size of thumbnail previews in order  to get an easier view of your texture assets.</p></div><p>By default, Unity <a id="id306" class="indexterm"></a>assumes that all imported textures will eventually be used as regular textures applied to 3D models in the scene, such as cubes, spheres, and meshes. In most cases, this assumption is correct because most games are 3D. However, for 2D games like the one we're making, the settings should be different. In our case, objects don't recede in the distance, moving further away, but just remain at a constant offset from the camera. For this reason, we must adjust some crucial properties for all imported textures. Specifically, select all imported textures, and, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> field from <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite 2D and UI</strong></span>. Then, remove the check mark from the <span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span> box. Then, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button. When you do this, Unity flags the assets as having a <span class="emphasis"><em>2D usage</em></span> internally. It allows transparent backgrounds to be applied where applicable (such as for PNG sprites) and also has important performance implications for graphics rendering, as we'll see. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.4</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.4: Configuring imported textures</p></div></div><p>Now that we've <a id="id307" class="indexterm"></a>imported all essential textures for the project, let's configure our main scene, game camera, and target resolution. Switch to the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab and set the resolution to <span class="strong"><strong>1024 x 600</strong></span>; which works well across many devices. To do this, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Free Aspect</strong></span> button from the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab toolbar and pick <span class="strong"><strong>1024 x 600</strong></span> from the drop-down menu, if it appears as an option. If not, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> button from the bottom of the list to add the new resolution. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.5</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.5: Adding game resolutions</p></div></div><p>To add a new <a id="id308" class="indexterm"></a>resolution, enter a custom name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> field, select <span class="strong"><strong>Fixed Resolution</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> drop-down, and then type your resolution dimensions in the <span class="strong"><strong>Width &amp; Height</strong></span> fields. Once completed, click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. Your target resolution should then be added as a selectable option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.6</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.6: Creating a custom resolution</p></div></div><p>Next, we'll configure the scene camera for a 2D setup so that our textures, when added as sprites, will display onscreen at a 1:1 ratio, texel for pixel. To achieve this, select the <span class="strong"><strong>MainCamera</strong></span> in the scene, either by clicking on it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene viewport</strong></span> or selecting it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene Hierarchy</strong></span>. Then, from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>, change <span class="strong"><strong>Projection</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span>. This ensures that the camera displays objects in true 2D with perspective and foreshortening effects removed. Then change the camera Size to <code class="literal">3</code>. The formula for this field is <span class="emphasis"><em>Screen Height / 2 / Pixel to World</em></span>. In this case, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Screen Height</em></span> is <span class="emphasis"><em>600</em></span>. Thus, <span class="emphasis"><em>600 / 2 = 300</em></span>. Then, <span class="emphasis"><em>300 / 100 = 3</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>100</em></span> refers to the pixel to world ratio applied to sprite textures; this details how many pixels in the texture will be mapped to a square meter in the world. A <a id="id309" class="indexterm"></a>value of <code class="literal">1</code> means <span class="emphasis"><em>1 pixel = 1 meter</em></span>. This value can be viewed and changed by selecting a sprite in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel to World ratio</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.7</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_07.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.7: Configuring camera orthographic size</p></div></div><p>To test the <a id="id310" class="indexterm"></a>camera and scene settings, simply drag and drop a background texture from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the scene. The <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> textures are sized at exactly 1024 x 600 to fit the scene background. Therefore, when added to a scene and when the camera is configured correctly, the background textures should fill the screen. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.8</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_08.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.8: Testing the camera settings with a texture</p></div></div></div>
