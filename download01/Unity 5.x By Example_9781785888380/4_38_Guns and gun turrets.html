Specifically, the level contains a <a id="id236" class="indexterm"></a>player and enemy ships. The player must shoot enemies but, right now, cannot do so. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 4.1</em></span>. On thinking carefully about weapons, we identify three main concepts or things that need development. First, there's the spawner or generator—the object that actually fires ammo in the scene when the fire button is pressed. Second, there's the ammo itself that, once generated, travels through the level on its own. Third, there's the ability for ammo to collide with other objects and damage them.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_04_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.1: The game so far</p></div></div><p>Tackling each area in order, we <a id="id237" class="indexterm"></a>begin with turrets—the points where bullets are spawned and fired. For this game, the player will have only one turret, but ideally, the game should support the addition of more, if desired, allowing the player to dual-fire or <a id="id238" class="indexterm"></a>more! To create the first turret, add a new empty game object to the scene by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Empty</strong></span> from the application menu. Name this <code class="literal">Turret</code>. Then, position the <code class="literal">Turret</code> object to the front of the spaceship, making sure that the blue forward vector arrow is pointing ahead in the direction that ammo will be fired. Finally, make the turret a child of the spaceship by dragging and dropping it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 4.2</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_04_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.2:Positioning a Turret object as a child of the spaceship</p></div></div><p>Creating a <code class="literal">Turret</code> object for the ammo as a spawn location is a splendid beginning, but for ammo to actually be <a id="id239" class="indexterm"></a>fired, we'll need an ammo object. Specifically, we'll <a id="id240" class="indexterm"></a>create an <code class="literal">Ammo</code> prefab that can be instantiated as ammo, when needed. We'll do this next.</p></div>
