That is, our game features several different screens, which the player may move between by walking off the edge of one screen and entering from the edge of another. Supporting this functionality introduces us to some new and interesting problems in Unity that are well worth exploring, as we'll see later. For now, let's make a second and third scene for the game, using the remaining background and foreground objects, and configuring collisions for each level, allowing the player prefab to work seamlessly with each environment. The details to create a level with collisions (Edge Colliders) are covered in depth in the previous chapter. The final, completed scenes are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level 2 is divided across two vertically arranged ledges with a set of moving platforms on the lower ledge. These are created from the moving platform prefab created in the previous section. The upper ledge is, for now, non-hazardous but this will be changed later as we add gun turrets that can shoot the player character. This level can be reached from the first original level by walking off the left edge of the screen. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 6.5</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_06_05.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6.5: Scene 2 – dangerous ledges and moving platforms</p></div></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Level 3 is <a id="id359" class="indexterm"></a>reached from the first original level by walking off the right edge of the screen. It consists of one ground-level plane featuring a house. It will be home to an NPC character whom the player can meet and receive a quest to collect an item. This character is created later in the chapter. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 6.6</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_06_06.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6.6: Scene 3 – a lonely house for an NPC</p></div></div></li></ul></div><p>Both Levels 2 and 3 were created entirely with the techniques seen so far. However, to give each scene its own charm and character, some unique elements must be added—some of these are specific to <a id="id360" class="indexterm"></a>each scene and some are more general. Let's now consider these in turn.</p></div>
