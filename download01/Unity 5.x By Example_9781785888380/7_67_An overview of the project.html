The terrain features hills, valleys, and varied terrain elements. Among the terrain will be scattered several enemy characters (NPCs). Each character features artificial intelligence. Specifically, each character will wander around (Patrol mode) searching for the player. If the player is sighted, the NPC will chase and pursue the player (Chase mode). If, during the chase, the enemy loses sight of the player, they will return to patrolling. On the other hand, if the enemy approaches the player during the chase, the enemy will attack the player (Attack mode). In short, therefore, the AI features three main states: Patrol, Chase, and Attack. This, in short, constitutes the enemy AI and represents the main challenge for the player on this project.
