Such games feature dangerous obstacles, challenging missions, and character interaction, as opposed to <span class="emphasis"><em>all-out</em></span> action like many first-person shooter games. Our adventure game will be no exception. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 5.1</em></span> for a glimpse of the game that we'll create. In this game, the player moves around using the keyboard arrows or <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> keys. Furthermore, they can jump with the spacebar and interact with characters simply by approaching them. During the game, the player will be tasked with a mission from an NPC character to collect an ancient gem hidden somewhere within a level. The player must then navigate dangerous obstacles in search of the gem, and then finally collect it before returning to the NPC, completing the game.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/figure_05_01.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.1: The 2D adventure game to create</p></div></div><p>To get started with creating the adventure, create a completely new and empty Unity project, and then import the <code class="literal">Particles</code>, <code class="literal">Effects</code>, <code class="literal">Characters</code>, <code class="literal">2D</code>, <code class="literal">ParticleSystems</code>, and <code class="literal">CrossPlatformInput</code> packages.
