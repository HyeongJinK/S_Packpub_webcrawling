Generally speaking, Unity uses the term <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>to mean a <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>. There are two main ways to make a new project, and it really doesn't matter which one you choose because both end up in the same place. If you're already in the Unity interface, looking at an existing scene or level, you can select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> from the application menu. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.2</em></span>. It may ask if you want to save changes to the currently opened project and you should choose either <span class="strong"><strong>Yes</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>No</strong></span>, depending on what you need. After selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span> option, Unity leads you to the project creation wizard:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_02.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.2: Creating a new project via the main menu</p></div></div><p>Alternatively, if you've just started Unity for the first time, you'll probably begin at the welcome dialog. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.3</em></span>. From here, you can access the new project creation wizard by choosing the <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>NEW PROJECT</strong></span> button:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_03.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.3: The Unity welcome screen</p></div></div><p>On reaching the <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>NEW PROJECT</strong></span> creation wizard, Unity can generate a new project for you on the basis of some basic settings. Simply fill in the name of your project (such as <code class="literal">CollectionGame</code>), and select a folder on your computer to contain the project files that will be generated automatically. Finally, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>3D</strong></span> button to indicate that we're going to create a 3D game, as opposed to <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span>, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create project</strong></span> button to complete the project generation process. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.4</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_04.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.4: Creating a new project</p></div></div></div>
