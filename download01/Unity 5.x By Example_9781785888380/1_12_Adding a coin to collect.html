However, we're supposed to be making a coin collection game and there aren't any coins for the player to collect yet. Now, to achieve fully collectible coins, we'll need to write some C# script, which will happen in the next chapter of this book. However, we can at least get started here at creating the coin object itself. To do this, we'll use a <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span> primitive that's scaled to form a coin-looking shape. To create a cylinder, select <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span> from the application menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_57.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.57: Create a Cylinder</p></div></div><p>Initially, the cylinder looks nothing like a coin. However, this is easily changed by scaling non-uniformly in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> <a id="id80" class="indexterm"></a>axis to make the cylinder thinner. Switch to the scale tool (R) and then scale the <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span> inward. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.58</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_58.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.58: Scaling the cylinder to make a collectible coin</p></div></div><p>After rescaling the coin, its collider no longer represents its volume. It appears much larger than it should (see <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.58</em></span>). By default, the <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span> is created with a <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule Collider</strong></span> as opposed to a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>. You can change the size of the<span class="strong"><strong> Capsule Collider</strong></span> component by adjusting the <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span> field from the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span> when the coin is selected. Lower the <span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span> field to shrink the collider to a more representative size and volume. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.59</em></span>. Alternatively, you could remove <span class="strong"><strong>Capsule Collider</strong></span> altogether and add <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> instead. Either way is fine; generally choose the simpler shape where possible. The colliders will be used in script in the next chapter to detect when the player collides <a id="id81" class="indexterm"></a>with the coin to collect them:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_59.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.59: Adjusting the Capsule Collider for the coin</p></div></div><p>Here we are! We now have the basic shape and structure for a coin. We will, of course, improve it carefully and critically in many ways in the next chapter. For example, we'll make it collectible and assign it a material to make it look shiny. However, here, using only a basic Unity primitive and scale tool, we're able to generate a shape that truly resembles a coin.</p></div>
