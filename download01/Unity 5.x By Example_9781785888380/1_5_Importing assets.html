Thus, games cannot exist without assets—they would otherwise look completely empty and lifeless. For this reason, we'll need assets to make the coin collection game we're working toward. After all, we'll need an environment to walk around and coins to collect!</p><p>Unity, however, is a <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>game engine </em></span>and not an <span class="emphasis"><em>asset creation</em></span> program. This means that assets, such as characters and props, are typically made first by artists in external, third-party software. From here, they are exported and transferred ready-made to Unity, and Unity is responsible only for bringing these assets to life in a coherent game that can be played. Third-party asset creation <a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a>programs include <span class="strong"><strong>Blender</strong></span> (which is free of charge), <span class="strong"><strong>Maya</strong></span> <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>or <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>3DS</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> to make 3D models, <span class="strong"><strong>Photoshop</strong></span> or <a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>GIMP</strong></span> (which is <a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a>free of charge) to create textures, and <a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Audacity</strong></span> (which is free of cost) to generate audio. There are plenty of other options too. The details of these programs are beyond the scope of this book. In any case, Unity assumes that you already have assets ready to import to build a game. For the coin collection game, we'll use assets that ship with Unity. So let's import these to our project. To do this, select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> from the application menu. Then select <a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Characters</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>ParticleSystems</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Environment</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Prototyping</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.9</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_09.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.9: Importing assets via the Import Package menu</p></div></div><p>Each time you import a <a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a>package from the menu, you'll be presented with an <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> dialog. Simply leave all settings at their defaults, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.10</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_10.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.10: Choosing Assets to import</p></div></div><p>By default, Unity decompresses all files from the package (a library of assets) into the current project. After importing, lots of different assets and data will have been added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>, ready for use. These files are copies of the originals. So any changes made to the imported <a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a>files will not affect or invalidate the originals, which <a id="id23" class="indexterm"></a>Unity maintains internally. The files include models, sounds, textures, and more. These are listed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Editor</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. See the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_11.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.11: Browsing imported assets from the Project panel</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"></a>Tip</h3><p>When selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> from the application menu, if you don't see all, or any, asset packages listed, you can download and install them separately from the Unity website at <a id="id24" class="indexterm"></a>
<a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/</a>. From the downloads page, choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Additional Downloads</strong></span> option, and then select the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Assets</strong></span> package. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.12</em></span>.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_12.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.12: Downloading the Standard Assets package</p></div></div><p>The imported <a id="id25" class="indexterm"></a>assets don't exist yet in our game. They don't appear on screen, and they won't do anything yet! Rather, they're simply added to the <a id="id26" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, which behaves as a library or repository of assets, from which we can pick and choose to build up a game. The assets imported thus far are built-in into Unity and we'll be continually using them in subsequent sections to make a functional coin collection game. To get more information about each asset, you can select the asset by clicking on it with the mouse, and asset-specific details will be shown on the right-hand side of the <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Editor</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> is a property sheet editor that appears on the right-hand side of the interface. It is context-sensitive and always changes to display properties for the selected object. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.13</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_13.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.13: The Inspector displays all the properties for the currently selected object</p></div></div></div>
