Let's separate the two floor meshes apart in space, leaving a gap between them that we'll fix by creating a bridge, which the player will be able to cross, moving between the floor spaces like islands. We can use the translate tool (<span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>) to move objects around. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.29</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_29.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.29: Separating the floor meshes into islands</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"></a>Tip</h3><p>If you want to create more floor objects, you can use the method that we've seen already by dragging and dropping the mesh asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> viewport. Alternatively, you can duplicate the selected object in the viewport by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> on the keyboard. Both methods produce the same result.</p></div><p>Next, we'll add some <a id="id51" class="indexterm"></a>props and obstacles to the scene. Drag and <a id="id52" class="indexterm"></a>drop some house objects onto the floor. The house object (<code class="literal">HousePrototype16x16x24</code>) is found in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> | <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> | <code class="literal">Prototyping</code> | <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.30</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_30.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.30: Adding house props to the scene</p></div></div><p>On dragging and dropping the house in the scene, it may align to the floor nicely with the bottom against the floor, or it may not align like that. If it does, that's splendid and great luck! However, we shouldn't rely on luck every time because we're professional game developers! Thankfully, we can make any two mesh objects align easily in Unity using vertex snapping. This <a id="id53" class="indexterm"></a>feature works by forcing two objects into <a id="id54" class="indexterm"></a>positional alignment within the scene by overlapping their vertices at a specific and common point.</p><p>For example, consider <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.31</em></span>. Here, a house object hovers awkwardly above the floor and we naturally want it to align level with the floor and perhaps over to the floor corner. To achieve this, start by selecting the house object (click on it or select it from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel). The object to be selected is the one that <span class="emphasis"><em>should move</em></span> to align and not the destination (which is the floor), which should remain in place.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_31.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.31: Misaligned objects can be snapped into place with Vertex Snapping</p></div></div><p>Next, activate the <a id="id55" class="indexterm"></a>translate tool (<span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>) and hold down the <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> key <a id="id56" class="indexterm"></a>for vertex snapping. With <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> held down, move the cursor around and see how the Gizmo cursor sticks to the nearest vertex of the selected mesh. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.32</em></span>. Unity is asking you to pick a source vertex for the snapping:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_32.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.32: Hold down V to activate Vertex Snapping</p></div></div><p>With <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> held down, move the cursor to the bottom corner of the house, and then click and drag from the corner to the floor mesh corner. The house will then snap align to the floor, corner to corner. When aligned this way, it release the <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> key, and the two meshes get aligned exactly at the vertices. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.33</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_33.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.33: Align two meshes by vertices</p></div></div><p>Now you can assemble a complete scene using the mesh assets included in the <code class="literal">Prototyping</code> <a id="id57" class="indexterm"></a>package. Drag and drop props in the scene, and <a id="id58" class="indexterm"></a>using translate, rotate, and scale, you can reposition, realign, and rotate these objects; using vertex snapping, you can align them wherever you need. Give this some practice. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.34</em></span> for the scene arrangement that I made using only these tools and assets:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_34.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.34: Building a complete level</p></div></div></div>
