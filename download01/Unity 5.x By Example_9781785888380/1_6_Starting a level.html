<span class="strong"><strong>Unity Standard Asset</strong></span> package, including architectural meshes for walls, floors, ceilings, and stairs. This means that <a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a>we're now ready to build our first level using these assets! Remember, in Unity, a scene means a level. The word scene and level can be used interchangeably here. They refer simply to a 3D space, that is, the space-time of the game worldâ€”the place where things exist. Since all games happen in space and time, we'll need a scene for the coin collection game. To create a new scene, select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Scene</strong></span> from the application menu, or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> on the keyboard. When you do this, a new and empty scene is created. You can see a visualization or preview of the scene via the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab, which occupies the largest part of the Unity interface. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.14</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_14.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.14: The Scene tab displays a preview of a 3D world</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"></a>Tip</h3><p>As shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.14</em></span>, other tabs besides the scene are visible and available in Unity. These include a <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab and an <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> tab; in some cases, there could be more as well. For now, we can ignore all the tabs except <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab is designed for quick and easy previewing of a level during its construction.</p></div><p>Each new <a id="id30" class="indexterm"></a>scene begins empty; well, almost empty. By default, each new scene begins with two objects. Specifically, a <span class="strong"><strong>Light</strong></span> to illuminate any other objects that are added, and a <span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span> to display and render the contents of the scene <a id="id31" class="indexterm"></a>from a specific vantage point. You can view a complete list of all the objects existing in the scene using the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, which is docked to the left-hand side of the Unity interface. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.15</em></span>. This panel displays the name of every <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in the scene. In Unity, the word <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> simply refers to a single, independent, and unique thing that lives within the scene, whether visible or not: meshes, lights, cameras, props, and more. Thus, the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel tells us about everything in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_15.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.15: The Hierarchy panel</p></div></div><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"></a>Tip</h3><p>You can even select objects in the scene by clicking on their name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p></div><p>Next, let's <a id="id32" class="indexterm"></a>add a floor to the scene. After all, the player needs something to stand on! We could build a floor mesh from scratch using third-party modeling software such as Maya, 3DS Max, or Blender. However, the Unity Standard Asset package, which was imported earlier, contains floor meshes that we can use. This is very convenient. These meshes are part of the <code class="literal">Prototyping</code> package. To access them via the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, open the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> folder by double-clicking it, and then access the <code class="literal">Prototyping</code> | <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder. From here, you can select objects and preview them from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.16</em></span>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"></a>Tip</h3><p>You could also quickly add a floor to the scene by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Plane</strong></span> from the application menu. However, this just adds a dull, grey floor, which isn't very interesting. Of course, you could change its appearance. As we'll see later, Unity lets you do this. However, for this tutorial, we'll use a specifically modeled floor mesh via the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> package from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_16.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.16: The Standard Assets/Prototyping package contains many meshes for quick scene building</p></div></div><p>The mesh named <code class="literal">FloorPrototype64x01x64</code> (as shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.16</em></span>) is suitable as a floor. To add this mesh to the scene, simply drag and drop the object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <a id="id33" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and then release the mouse. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.17</em></span>. When you do this, notice how the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view changes to display the newly <a id="id34" class="indexterm"></a>added mesh within the 3D space, and the mesh name also appears as a listing in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_17.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.17: Dragging and dropping mesh assets from the Project panel to the Scene view will add them to the scene</p></div></div><p>The floor mesh asset from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel has now been instantiated as a <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> in the scene. This <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>means that a copy or clone of the mesh asset, based on the original in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, has been added to the scene as a separate <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Instance</strong></span> (or <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>) of the floor in the scene still depends on the floor asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. However, the asset does not depend on the instance. This means that by deleting the floor in the scene, you will not delete the asset. However, if you delete the asset, you will invalidate the <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. You can also create more floors in <a id="id36" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> if you want by dragging and dropping the floor asset many times from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. Each time, a new instance of the floor is created in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> as a separate and unique <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>, although all the added instances will still depend on the single floor asset in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.18</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_18.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.18: Adding multiple instances of the floor mesh to the scene</p></div></div><p>We don't actually need the duplicate floor pieces, however. So let's delete them. Just click on the duplicates in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and then press <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> on the keyboard to remove them. Remember, you can also select and delete objects by clicking on their name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> <a id="id37" class="indexterm"></a>panel and pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span>. Either way, this leaves us with a single floor piece and a solid start to building our scene. One remaining problem, though, concerns the floor and its name. By looking carefully in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, we can <a id="id38" class="indexterm"></a>see that the floor name is <code class="literal">FloorPrototype64x01x64</code>. This name is long, obtuse, and unwieldy. We should change it to something more manageable and meaningful. This is not technically essential but is good practice to keep our work clean and organized. There are many ways to rename an object. One way is to first select it and then enter a new name in the name field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Object Inspector</strong></span>. I'll rename it <code class="literal">WorldFloor</code>. See <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.19</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785888380/graphics/B05118_01_19.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.19: Renaming the floor mesh</p></div></div></div>
