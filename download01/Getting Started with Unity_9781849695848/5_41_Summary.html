This can be done by using AI algorithms such as <code class="literal">A*</code> or other path-finding techniques, or by using dedicated libraries available from the assets store. Note that Unity3D includes a built-in path-finding feature referred as <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Navigation</strong></span>; however, this feature is only available and applicable in the Pro-version of Unity3D. Finally, while waypoints were employed to move the character along a path, you may find it useful to employ the library called <code class="literal">iTween</code>. This library, available for free in the assets store, is relatively easy to use and includes several interesting features that could definitely improve our game.</p><p>In this chapter, we have learned to apply animations to our character as well as some levels of artificial intelligence. We created different states and associated transitions using the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> window, and we have also managed to monitor and trigger these states through scripting. Finally, we have used waypoints to define a path for one of the enemies. In the next chapter, we will build on these skills to finish the game: add a last level, a splash screen, and a menu system, as well as features that make it possible to save the score and other properties of the game across scenes.</p></div>
