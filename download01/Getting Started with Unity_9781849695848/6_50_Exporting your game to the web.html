Thankfully, Unity3D includes an export feature to export our game to a web format. Let's use this feature to create a web version of your game as shown in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the build settings (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span>), and reorder the scene by dragging-and-dropping them, so that <code class="literal">splashScreen</code> is first, <code class="literal">instructions</code> is second, <code class="literal">chapter6</code> is third, <code class="literal">gameSuccess</code> if fourth, and <code class="literal">gameOver</code> is fifth.</p></li><li><p>In the section <span class="strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span>, select the option <span class="strong"><strong>Web Player</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the button labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span>. This will open a window where we can specify the location of the exported files. Provide a name for the exported file and select a folder where the game should be created.</p></li><li><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. The conversion should last for just under one minute. Once the process is complete, open the folder that we have specified previously, it should include two files: an HTML file and a file with the extension <code class="literal">.unity3d</code>. Open the HTML file in your browser.</p></li></ol></div></div>
