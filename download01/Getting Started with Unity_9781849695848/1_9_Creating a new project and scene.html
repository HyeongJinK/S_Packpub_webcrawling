Let's<a id="id45" class="indexterm"></a> go through the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Project</strong></span>. A window labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Project Wizard</strong></span> should appear. This window provides a default directory for our project; however, we can set the location of our project by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Set</strong></span> button. By default,<a id="id46" class="indexterm"></a> the name of the project is <span class="strong"><strong>New Unity Project</strong></span>, but this can also be changed. At this stage, it is also possible to select and add the packages to include in our game. If we scroll down through the list below the label <span class="strong"><strong>Import the following packages</strong></span>, we will see several packages, which consist of assets that can be used to enhance our game. These assets can be imported into our project at a later stage. Therefore, we will not select any of these for the time being.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5848OT_01_09.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Choose and set a directory and a name for our project (in the previous screenshot the project is called <span class="strong"><strong>maze</strong></span> and is located in the directory <code class="literal">/Users/pfelicia/</code>).</p></li><li><p>Once you are happy with the project directory and its name, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>If you<a id="id47" class="indexterm"></a> have made any changes to the <code class="literal">AngryBots</code> project,<a id="id48" class="indexterm"></a> you may be asked whether you would like to save you changes.
