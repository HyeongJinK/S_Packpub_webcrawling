First, we learned how to create a health bar and update its value and color based on the health of the player. Then, we looked into the creation of a top-down mini-map of the level. For this we used cameras, camera viewports, and layers, so that only specific objects are displayed on the map. We also added self-illuminated properties to all dots representing the objects on the map. After finalizing our interface, we created a gun, thanks to ray-casting, a technique used to detect objects within a specific range. To make this gun more precise and realistic, we added a crosshair that would only be displayed when the player has collected the gun, and sparks at the point of impact of the bullet. In the next chapter, we will add more interactivity to our game by including enemies with some levels of intelligence, and by applying damage to both the player and the enemies.</p></div>
