Many of these games are listed on the Unity3D website (<a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/gallery/made-with-unity/game-list" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/gallery/made-with-unity/game-list</a>). Unity3D is built with simplicity and effectiveness in mind to allow both novice and advanced developers to maximize their game creation experience. It makes it<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> possible to develop games of different genres (for example, platformers, role playing games, first-person shooters, massive multiplayer online role playing games, simulations, or strategy games), and for a comprehensive number of platforms (for example, Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8, PC, Mac, Linux, PS3, or XBOX 360). There are many game engines available out there, but Unity3D is one of the very few that provides a significant number of tools and techniques that simplify the development process, help to produce high-quality games, and addresses many aspects of game development, including an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Artificial Intelligence (AI), animations, or lighting. As for other game engines, Unity3D makes it possible to code the game using relatively high-level programming and scripting languages, including JavaScript, Boo, or C#. While C# may require prior knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), JavaScript is an ideal scripting language for those with no or little background in programming. In this book, we will create our game using JavaScript.</p><p>In addition to its built-in capabilities, Unity3D offers the possibility to employ third-party plugins that greatly enhance the workflow and add some very interesting effects and functionalities. We will have the opportunity to discover some of these libraries throughout this book.</p><p>Finally, Unity3D <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>includes a built-in access to the assets store (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/</a>), an online store that provides material for our Unity projects (for example, textures, characters, GUI systems, or scripts). <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>While the majority of these items have to be purchased, some of them can be imported in our project for free, so that we can create a game with a small budget. Most of these items can be integrated seamlessly in our game.</p></div>
