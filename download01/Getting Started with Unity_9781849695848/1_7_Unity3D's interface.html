The default layout is applied in Unity3D, and you will notice that the screen is divided into several sections or views (as highlighted in the following screenshot), including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view<a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a> labeled as <span class="strong"><strong>1</strong></span>, where we can<a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a> visualize and modify the scene we have created for our game</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view<a id="id20" class="indexterm"></a> labeled as <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span>, where<a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a> we can see a list of all the objects included in our scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view<a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a> labeled as <span class="strong"><strong>3</strong></span>, which<a id="id23" class="indexterm"></a> contains all assets used in the current project</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window<a id="id24" class="indexterm"></a> labeled as <span class="strong"><strong>4</strong></span>, which<a id="id25" class="indexterm"></a> displays the properties of the object selected</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5848OT_01_02.jpg" /></div></li></ul></div><p>The layout of this window can be modified using <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Layouts</strong></span>. We can also resize the different windows and save our layout for a later use by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Layout</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"></a>The Scene view</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view<a id="id26" class="indexterm"></a> displays the scene and makes it possible to navigate through it. Scenes are comparable to game levels and include all relevant objects and environments. To the right of the tab <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>, we can find a tab labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>. This view displays the scene just the way it would appear when the game is launched (that is, from the active camera). For example, if we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tab, the view should switch to the camera used in the game to follow the player, as illustrated in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5848OT_01_03.jpg" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"></a>Navigating in the scene</h4></div></div></div><p>Unity3D provides several means and shortcuts to navigate through the scene, including the arrow<a id="id27" class="indexterm"></a> keys from our keyboard. This mode is similar to the <a id="id28" class="indexterm"></a>controls used in a First-Person Shooter (FPS), except that there is no <span class="strong"><strong>mouselook</strong></span> option<a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a> in this mode. Holding down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key in this mode will increase our speed. To navigate in a mode that is closer to the controls usually found in FPS games, we can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Fly</strong></span> mode, which<a id="id30" class="indexterm"></a> is similar to the previous mode, except that it includes a mouselook feature. We can access this mode by holding down the mouse right button inside the scene. We can then navigate through the scene using the keys <span class="emphasis"><em>W</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>; float up and down using the keys <span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span>, or look around by moving the mouse left, right, forward, or back. In addition to navigating through the scene, we can also focus on one object by double-clicking on this object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> window or by selecting this object in the hierarchy (by clicking on it once), and moving the mouse over the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view and pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> (focus) key (this will cause Unity3D to move the camera so that the object is displayed on the screen). We can zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel; pan the view by clicking and dragging the mouse (note that panning the view works essentially when the <span class="strong"><strong>hand</strong></span> tool is selected after pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Q</em></span> key).</p><p>We can rotate the view by pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> key and clicking and dragging the mouse, or view the scene from the x, y, or z axes using the gizmo located in the top-right corner of the window, as illustrated in the following screenshot. Clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> (green) arrow will display the view from the y-axis; the same applies to the <span class="strong"><strong>z</strong></span> (blue), and <span class="strong"><strong>x</strong></span> (red) axes. Clicking on the box in the middle of the gizmo will toggle the view between perspective and isometric modes.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5848OT_01_04.jpg" /></div><p>There are many other shortcuts for Unity3D and we can find them in the documentation provided <a id="id31" class="indexterm"></a>by Unity by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Manual</strong></span> from<a id="id32" class="indexterm"></a> Unity3D and the pages dedicated to scene view<a id="id33" class="indexterm"></a> navigation in Unity3D (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html</a>). This being said, the shortcuts and controls described previously should be sufficient for us to start navigating through a Unity3D scene.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"></a>The Hierarchy view</h3></div></div></div><p>This view<a id="id34" class="indexterm"></a> lists all objects present in the scene. By default, a camera is present and the scene is viewed through its lens. Any subsequent object created or imported will appear in this view (for example, light, camera, or box) as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5848OT_01_05.jpg" /></div><p>Note that objects can be duplicated in this window using the keys <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> (or right-click + duplicate). Groups can be created in this window; for example, when a group of objects need to share the same position or orientation (for example, transform properties), an empty object can be created, and these objects can then be added to the empty object. This way, any transformation applied to the empty object (container or parent) will be recursively applied to the children.</p><p>For example, in the <code class="literal">AngryBots</code> scene in the folder labeled <code class="literal">Environment (static)</code> we will notice a container labeled <code class="literal">barrels</code> that includes all barrels featured in the scene. If we apply a transformation to this container, this transformation will be applied to all objects included within this folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>Throughout this book, Mac OS users need to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> key or Apple key instead of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> key for keyboard shortcuts.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"></a>The Project view</h3></div></div></div><p>This <a id="id35" class="indexterm"></a>view features all assets used in the current project, including textures, audio, other scenes, prefabs (these are comparable to templates and will be explained later), fonts, or scripts (for example, JavaScript or C#).
