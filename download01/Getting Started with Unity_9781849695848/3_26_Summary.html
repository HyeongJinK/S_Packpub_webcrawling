From the first section, we created our first script and gradually introduced more interaction into our game, including rotating objects, a timer, and collision detection. Throughout this section, we have also learned how to interact with other <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> in the game, including <code class="literal">GUIText</code> and <code class="literal">GUITexture</code> objects. We have then combined these skills to display a notification text every time an object has been collected, as well as a corresponding texture on the screen. Finally, we have learned how to play an animation through JavaScript to open the exit door. In the next chapter, we will add more elements to our GUI, and we will also create a script to fire bullets.</p></div>
