We will also learn how to create animations in Unity3D using built-in functionalities (for example, Mecanim).</p><p>After completing this chapter, we will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Understand how to animate objects and create custom animation based on Unity3D's built-in animations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Include these animations in the game and control them through scripting</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Use Unity3D's built-in Mecanim system to animate existing characters</p></li></ul></div><p>After going through these principles, we will be completing the tasks to enhance the maze game and the gameplay. We will apply animations to characters and trigger these in particular situations. Throughout this section, we will improve the gameplay by allowing NPCs to follow the player where he/she is nearby (behavior based on distance), and attack the user when he/she is within reach. All material required to complete this chapter is available for free download on the companion website: <a class="ulink" href="http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/" target="_blank">http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"></a>Note</h3><p>The pack for this chapter includes some great models and animations that were provided by the company Mixamo<a id="id356" class="indexterm"></a> to enhance the quality of our final game. The characters were animated using Mixamo's easy online sequences and animation building tools.
