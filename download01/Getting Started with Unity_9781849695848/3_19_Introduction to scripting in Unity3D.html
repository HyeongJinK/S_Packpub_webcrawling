Scripts make it possible to add logic and<a id="id129" class="indexterm"></a> more interactivity to our games, as well as customize interaction based on the players' actions. In Unity3D, we can create scripts using both JavaScript and C#. While JavaScript is usually considered an easy and accessible scripting language, C# is usually favored by intermediate and advanced Unity3D programmers, as it facilitates the programming workflow and makes it possible to develop more complex programs and interaction paradigms, notably due to its Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capabilities. For these reasons, it is often difficult for beginners to know and decide what language they will start using. Both of these languages have their advantages and limitations.</p><p>All code created in this chapter is available from the companion website <a class="ulink" href="http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/" target="_blank">http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/</a>.</p><p>In this chapter, we will start to flesh-out the mechanics for the level we have created in the previous chapter, with the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The player will try to find the exit of the maze</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The player will have limited time</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Time will be displayed onscreen</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The player will need to find and collect different items</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Objects collected will be displayed onscreen</p></li></ul></div></div>
