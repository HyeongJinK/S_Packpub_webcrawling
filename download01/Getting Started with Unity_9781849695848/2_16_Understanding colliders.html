However, this would not be possible without colliders. When we added the different component of the maze (for example, wall or ground), a collider was added by default to these objects. This makes it possible to detect collision between objects. In our case, the first-person controller includes a default collider. As a result, this character controller collided with the walls. There are several types of colliders in Unity3D, including box, sphere, capsule, wheel, or terrain colliders. Some of these colliders are based on basic shapes such as boxes (for example, box colliders), spheres (for example, sphere colliders), or capsule (for example, capsule colliders).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>It is usually a good practice to use colliders with a shape that is similar to the object on which they are applied. For example, we could use a box collider for a door, or a sphere collider for a ball. Using these basic shapes for collision also has some performance advantages, as they require less computational resources than more customized and precise colliders such as mesh colliders. Note that when the object attached to this collider is resized, the collider is resized accordingly.</p></div><p>Let's look at the floor object<a id="id117" class="indexterm"></a> and its collider by following these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view<a id="id118" class="indexterm"></a>, click on one object labeled <span class="strong"><strong>floor</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window<a id="id119" class="indexterm"></a>, we can see a list of components for this object. Components can be added to objects either by default (when they are created) or after creation (using the <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> menu).</p></li><li><p>We<a id="id120" class="indexterm"></a> can see that one of these components is a <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781849695848/graphics/5858OS_02_04.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Let's test the effect of colliders on walls by doing the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select one of the walls in the hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>Identify<a id="id121" class="indexterm"></a> its box collider in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>Deactivate <a id="id122" class="indexterm"></a>the box collider (by checking the box to the right of the label <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window).</p></li><li><p>Test the scene.</p></li><li><p>We should be able to walk through this wall.</p></li><li><p>Stop the scene and reactivate the box collider on this object.</p></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>We can select several objects and change their properties simultaneously in Unity3D, provided that the property that we need to modify is available in all objects. For example, if we want to deactivate the colliders for two different walls, we could select the two walls (press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> and click on the objects in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view<a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a>) and deactivate the component <span class="strong"><strong>Box Colliders</strong></span> once; this change will then be applied to both walls.</p></div><p>We will now remove the collider<a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a> and add another collider to the object:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select one of the walls in the hierarchy, identify its box collider in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window and remove the collider: right-click on the label <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Component</strong></span> from the contextual menu; doing so should remove the collider.</p></li><li><p>Test the scene; we should be able to walk through the wall.</p></li><li><p>Stop the scene.</p></li><li><p>Add a <a id="id125" class="indexterm"></a>new collider to this object:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the wall in the hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>Select: <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Physics</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>This should add a new box collider to the object.</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>Test the scene.</p></li><li><p>We should now be able to collide with the wall again.</p></li></ol></div><p>We could do the same for the ground as shown in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select the object labeled <span class="strong"><strong>floor</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> view.</p></li><li><p>Deactivate its box collider in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>Test the scene.</p></li><li><p>Our character should literally fall indefinitely (because there is no collision detected with the floor).</p></li></ol></div><p>Colliders<a id="id126" class="indexterm"></a> can help to make our scene realistic. When colliders are activated (that is, during a collision), built-in functions are called so that we can in turn perform specific actions when this collision occurs (for example, destroy an object or play a sound). We will cover this aspect in the next chapters.</p></div>
