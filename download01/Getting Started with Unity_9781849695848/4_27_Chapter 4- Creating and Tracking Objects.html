<div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04"></a>Chapter 4. Creating and Tracking Objects</h2></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will add more interaction to our game:  with special effects as well as additional<a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a> GUI elements, including a mini-map. We will also look at<a id="id256" class="indexterm"></a> advanced techniques to handle cameras and camera views.</p><p>After completing this chapter, we will be able to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Instantiate objects in real-time</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Switch between and display multiple camera views</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Define and apply layers to filter content displayed by a camera</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Apply special effects (for example, sparks)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Display a real-time map of the current level</p></li></ul></div><p>Throughout this chapter, we will improve the existing game, and add a script for the hero to fire bullets, as well as a real time mini-map (for example, with an updated position of the hero and the items to collect). All material required to complete this chapter is available for free download on the companion website <a class="ulink" href="http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/" target="_blank">http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/</a>.</p><p>In the previous chapters, we have managed to create an environment where the player could collect items and open the exit door if he/she had the corresponding keys. In this chapter, we will build upon the skills that we have acquired to improve the game play: a health bar will be displayed on the screen at all times, the player will be able to see a top view of the maze that reveals its position as well as the position of items that can be collected, and the player will also be able to fire a gun. Before we start creating our level, we will need to download the necessary assets from the companion website as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Open the link for the companion website: <a class="ulink" href="http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/" target="_blank">http://patrickfelicia.wordpress.com/publications/books/unity-outbreak/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Download the material for this chapter by clicking (or right-clicking and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Download to</strong></span> from the contextual menu) on the link package for <code class="literal">chapter4</code>. This will download a file labeled <code class="literal">chapter4.unitypackage</code>.</p></li><li><p>In Unity3D, create a new folder titled <code class="literal">chapter4</code> inside the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder, and select this folder (<code class="literal">chapter4</code>).</p></li><li><p>Import the package we have just downloaded into Unity3D. From Unity3D, select <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package</strong></span>. Browse to the directory where we saved the package downloaded from the companion website, and select it.</p></li><li><p>This should create a folder titled <code class="literal">chapter4_pack</code> within the folder labeled <code class="literal">chapter4</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Finally, <a id="id257" class="indexterm"></a>we<a id="id258" class="indexterm"></a> will duplicate the scene we have created in the previous chapter by saving the current scene (<span class="strong"><strong>File Save</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>), and then saving this scene as <code class="literal">chapter4</code> (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save Scene As…</strong></span>). This way, we have preserved the scene created in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting to Know Unity3D</em></span>, as <code class="literal">chapter3</code>, and we can start a new scene that includes the same content and that is named <code class="literal">chapter4</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p>It is also possible to duplicate the previous scene from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view by selecting<a id="id259" class="indexterm"></a> the scene labeled <code class="literal">chapter3</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> view, duplicating it (<span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Duplicate</strong></span>), and renaming the new scene <code class="literal">chapter4</code>.</p></div></div>
