We have applied different transformations, including moving, scaling, and rotating. We have also learned about colliders and their importance for our game. Finally, we have used a built-in water object or prefab to simulate water in our game. In the next chapter, we will learn how to use JavaScript and interact with objects within the Unity3D scene.</p></div>
