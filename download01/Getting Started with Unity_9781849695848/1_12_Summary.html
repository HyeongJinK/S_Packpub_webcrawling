We have looked at the user interface employed in Unity3D, the different windows available, as well as useful shortcuts. Then, we have learned how to create and manipulate built-in objects, using both the inspector and contextual commands and menus. We have also learned how to apply colors and textures. Building on these skills, we then added both first- and third-person controllers for the player to navigate through the scene.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will combine the skills that we have acquired so far to create an indoor environment for our game including walls, doors, and water.</p></div>
