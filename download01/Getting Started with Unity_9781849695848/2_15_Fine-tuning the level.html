For example, you will notice that although the maze is sealed-off, we can still see some light in parts where there are no point lights. This is essentially due to ambient light, which can be modified in Unity3D. We can change the properties of the ambient light as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Select: <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Render Settings</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>A window labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Render Settings</strong></span> should be displayed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, with several attributes available, including <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Light</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the rectangle to the right of the label <span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Light</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>A new window labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> should appear.</p></li><li><p>Under the option labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Sliders</strong></span>, we can see values for each component of the color of the ambient light expressed using the RGB code. The field labeled <span class="strong"><strong>R</strong></span> provides the amount of red included in the color, the field labeled <span class="strong"><strong>G</strong></span> provides the amount of green included in the color, the field labeled <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span> provides the amount of blue included in the color, and the field <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> is for the alpha channel (transparency). For our game, we will set the ambient light to a dark gray, which means that the values for the fields <span class="strong"><strong>R</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>G</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span> components can all be set to <code class="literal">60</code>.</p></li><li><p>Close the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> window.</p></li><li><p>We could also enable the fog by checking the box to the right of the label <span class="strong"><strong>Fog</strong></span>, and setting its density to <code class="literal">.05</code>.</p></li><li><p>Play the scene (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span>).</p></li></ol></div><p>You may also notice that some lights are flickering and that the lighting changes constantly, especially on the floor. This is because at any given time, the floor may be lit by<a id="id115" class="indexterm"></a> several point lights. We can solve this problem by changing the quality settings of our scene: select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Quality</strong></span>, and in the section <span class="strong"><strong>Rendering</strong></span>, increasing the <span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Light Count</strong></span> (for example, to <code class="literal">5</code>).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>The render settings the render settings can increase the visual impact of your game, so it is good practice to tweak these settings until we are happy with the look and feel of our game. Render settings need to be defined for each scene and are also available through scripting, so that we can adjust these dynamically. For example, we could simulate a fog with increasing density over time, or ambient light with variable intensity overtime.</p></div></div>
