Game engines usually provide an Integrated Development Environment (<span class="strong"><strong>IDE</strong></span>)<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>, where all activities and tasks related to game development are seamlessly integrated using coding, objects, and environment creation. They usually make it possible for designers to control the logic of their game using high-level programming or scripting languages, hence decreasing the learning curve and improving the workflow. With the evolution of technology, many game designers have used game engines. While game engines were initially essential for the production of video games, they are now used for a wide range of applications, with purposes other than gaming. For example, game engines are now employed for simulation, teaching, and training, as they often make it possible to create and manage very realistic environments easily. Moreover, such tools provide means for the creation of universally accessible environments, thanks notably to popular export formats for web and mobile devices.</p></div>
