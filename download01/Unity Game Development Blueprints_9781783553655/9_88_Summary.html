I could write an entire book on how to create user interfaces, but in the meantime, I have some additional resources that may be beneficial as you go on from here! At this point, we also have all the knowledge we need to create a wide array of various gameplay projects from here on! You've worked in 2D and 3D; you've built levels in many different ways; you've programmed three complete games; and on top of that, you've learned about both of Unity's UI systems, one of which isn't even out yet! This may be the end of the book; but it's only the start of your Unity journey!</p></div>
