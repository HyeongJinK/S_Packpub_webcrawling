We will be creating a first person shooter; however, instead of shooting a gun to damage our enemies, we will be shooting a picture in a survival horror environment; similar to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Fatal Frame</em></span> series of games and the recent indie title <span class="emphasis"><em>DreadOut</em></span>. To get started on our project, we're first going to look at creating our level or, in this case, our environments starting with the exterior.</p><p>In the game industry, there are two main roles in level creation: the environment artist and level designer.</p><p>An <span class="strong"><strong>environment artist</strong></span><a id="id250" class="indexterm"></a> is a person who builds the assets that go into the environment. He/she uses tools such as 3ds Max or Maya to create the model, and then uses other tools such as Photoshop to create textures and normal maps.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>level designer</strong></span><a id="id251" class="indexterm"></a> is responsible for taking the assets that the environment artist has created and assembling them into an environment for players to enjoy. He/she designs the gameplay elements, creates the scripted events, and tests the gameplay. Typically, a level designer will create environments through a combination of scripting and using a tool that may or may not be in development as the game is being made. In our case, that tool is Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"></a>Note</h3><p>One important thing to note is that most companies have their own definition for different roles. In some companies, a level designer may need to create assets and an environment artist may need to create a level layout. There are also some places that hire someone to just do lighting, or just to place meshes (called a mesher) because they're so good at it.</p></div></div>
