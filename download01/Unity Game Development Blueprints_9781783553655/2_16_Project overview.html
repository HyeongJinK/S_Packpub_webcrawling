This chapter uses the UnityGUI system that existed before Unity 4.6. Even though the new system does have its advantages, the old system is still quite useful to learn. It's still the only way to create UI elements for the Unity Editor (which you can use to create plugins that you can sell on the Asset Store), and it has a much larger amount of documentation out there to help new users.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are interested in learning specifically about the new GUI system, please check out <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating GUIs Part 2 â€“ Unity's New GUI System</em></span>, where I talk about specific cases in which you'd want to use the new system.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"></a>Your objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>This project will be split into a<a id="id85" class="indexterm"></a> number of tasks.

If you have not completed the project yet, please take the <code class="literal">Chapter_1_Completed.unitypackage</code> file and import it to a blank project in Unity.</p><p>We will also need some graphical assets for use in our project. These can be downloaded from the example code provided for this book on the Packt Publishing website at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support</a>.</p><p>Browse through the code files and download the <code class="literal">Chapter2.zip</code> package and unzip it. Inside the <code class="literal">Chapter2</code> folder there are a number of things, including an <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder that will have the art, sound, and font files that you'll need for the project as well as the <code class="literal">Chapter_2_Completed.unitypackage</code> (this is the completed chapter package that includes the entire project for you to work with). I've also added in the completed game exported (<code class="literal">TwinstickShooter GUI Exported</code>) as well as the entire project zipped up in the GUI <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter Project.zip</code> file.</p></div></div>
