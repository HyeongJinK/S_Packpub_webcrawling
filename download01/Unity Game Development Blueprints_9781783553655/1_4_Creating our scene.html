Once inside, go to your operating system's browser window, open up the <code class="literal">Chapter 1/Assets</code> folder that we provided, and drag the <code class="literal">playerShip.png</code> file into the folder to move it into our project. Once added, confirm that the image is <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> by clicking on it and confirming from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab that <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> is <code class="literal">Sprite</code> (Sprite (2D and UI) in 4.6). If it isn't, simply change it to that, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>If you do not want to drag-and-drop the files, you can also right-click within the folder in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Browser</strong></span> (bottom-left corner) and select <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> to select a file from a folder to bring it in.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_5.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>The art assets used for this tutorial were provided by Kenney. To see more of their work, please check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kenney.nl" target="_blank">www.kenney.nl</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Next, drag-and-drop<a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a> the ship into the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> tab (the center part that's currently dark gray). Once completed, set the position of the sprite to the center of the <span class="strong"><strong>Screen</strong></span> (0, 0) by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Position</strong></span>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_6.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, with <a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a>the player in the world, let's add in a background. Drag-and-drop the <code class="literal">background.png</code> file into your <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span> folder. After that, drag-and-drop a copy into the scene.</p><p>If you put the background on top of the ship, you'll notice that currently the background is in front of the player (Unity puts newly added objects on top of previously created ones if their position on the Z axis is the same; this is commonly referred to as the <span class="strong"><strong>z-order</strong></span>), so let's fix that.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>Objects on the same Z axis without sorting layer are considered to be equal in terms of draw order; so just because a scene looks a certain way this time, when you reload the level it may look different. In order to guarantee that an object is in front of another one in 2D space is by having different Z values or using sorting layers.</p></div></li><li><p>Select your background object, and go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. Under <span class="strong"><strong>Sorting Layer</strong></span>, select <span class="strong"><strong>Add Sorting Layer</strong></span>. After that, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> icon for <span class="strong"><strong>Sorting Layers</strong></span>, and then give <span class="strong"><strong>Layer 1</strong></span> a name, <code class="literal">Background</code>. Now, create a sorting layer for <code class="literal">Foreground</code> and <code class="literal">GUI</code>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_7.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, place<a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a> the player ship on the foreground and the background by selecting the object once again and then setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Sorting Layer</strong></span> property via the drop-down menu. Now, if you play the game, you'll see that the ship is in front of the background, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_8.jpg" /></div><p>At this point, we can just duplicate our background a number of times to create our full background by selecting the object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, but that is tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we can create all the duplicates by either using code or creating a tileable texture. For our purposes, we'll just create a texture.</p></li><li><p>Delete the background sprite by left-clicking on the background object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab on the left-hand side and then pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key. Then select the background sprite in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, change <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>tab to <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now let's create a 3D cube by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Game Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> from the top toolbar. Change the object's name from <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Background</code>. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>) and the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are using Unity 4.6 you will need to go to <span class="strong"><strong>Game Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>3D Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> to create the cube.</p></div><p>Since our camera is at 0, 0, -10 and the player is at 0, 0, 0, putting the object at position 0, 0, 1 will put it behind all of our sprites. By creating a 3D object and scaling it, we are making it really large, much larger than the player's monitor. If we scaled a sprite, it would be one really large image with pixelation, which would look really bad. By using a 3D object, the texture that is applied to the faces of the 3D object is repeated, and since the image is tileable, it looks like one big continuous image.</p></li><li><p>Remove <a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> by right-clicking on it and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Component</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Next, we will need to create a material for our background to use. To do so, under the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>, and name the material as <code class="literal">BackgroundMaterial</code>. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> property, click on the drop-down menu, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unlit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> box on the right-hand side, and select the background texture. Once completed, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Tiling</strong></span> property's<span class="strong"><strong> x</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">25</code>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_9.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"></a>Note</h3><p>In addition to just selecting from the menu, you can also drag-and-drop the background texture directly onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> box, and it will set the property.</p><p>Tiling tells Unity how many times the image should repeat in the <span class="strong"><strong>x</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> positions, respectively.</p></div></li><li><p>Finally, go back to the Background object in Hierarchy. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component, open up <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> by left-clicking on the arrow, and change <span class="strong"><strong>Element 0</strong></span> to our <span class="strong"><strong>BackgroundMaterial</strong></span> material. Consider the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_10.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, when <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>we play the game, you'll see that we now have a complete background that tiles properly.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Scripting 101</h3></div></div></div><p>In Unity, the <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>behavior of game objects is controlled by the different components that are attached to them in a form of association called <span class="strong"><strong>composition</strong></span>. These components are things that we can add and remove at any time to create much more complex objects. If you want to do anything that isn't already provided by Unity, you'll have to write it on your own through a process we call <span class="strong"><strong>scripting</strong></span>. Scripting<a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a> is an essential element in all but the simplest of video games.</p><p>Unity allows you to code in either C#, Boo, or UnityScript, a language designed specifically for use with Unity and modelled after JavaScript. For this book, we will use C#.</p><p>C# is an object-oriented programming language—an industry-standard language similar to Java or C++. The majority of plugins from Asset Store are written in C#, and code written in C# can port to other platforms, such as mobile, with very minimal code changes. C# is also a <a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a>strongly-typed language, which means that if there<a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a> is any issue with the code, it will be identified within Unity and will stop you from running the game until it's fixed. This may seem like a hindrance, but when working with code, I very much prefer to write correct code and solve problems before they escalate to something much worse.</p></div></div>
