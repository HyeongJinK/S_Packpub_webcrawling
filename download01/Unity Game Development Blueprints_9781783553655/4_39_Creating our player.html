However, instead of creating our player from scratch as we've done previously, we will make use of the code that Unity has provided us. We will perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Start off by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Character Controller</strong></span>. When the <span class="strong"><strong>Importing Package</strong></span> dialog comes up, we only need to import the files shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_04_18.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now drag-and-drop<a id="id315" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>First Person Controller</strong></span> prefab <a id="id316" class="indexterm"></a>under the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> folder in our <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab into your world, where you want the player to spawn, setting the <span class="strong"><strong>Y Position</strong></span> value to above 100. If you see yourself fall through the world instead of hitting the ground when you spawn, then increase the <span class="strong"><strong>Y Position</strong></span> value until you get there.</p></li><li><p>If you open up the <span class="strong"><strong>First Person Controller</strong></span> object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> tab, you'll notice that it has a <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object already, so delete the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object that already exists in the world.</p></li><li><p>Right now, if we played the game, you'd see that everything is dark because we don't have any light. For the purposes of demonstration, let's add a directional light by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note53"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are using Unity 4.6 or later, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create  General</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Terrain</strong></span> to create the Terrain.</p></div></li><li><p>Save your scene and hit the <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span> button to drop into your level:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_04_19.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>At this point, we<a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a> have a playable level that we can<a id="id318" class="indexterm"></a> explore and move around in!</p></div>
