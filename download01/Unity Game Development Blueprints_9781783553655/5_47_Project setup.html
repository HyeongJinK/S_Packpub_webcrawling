Now, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>With Unity started, open the project from the previous chapter.</p></li><li><p>Since we want to keep our projects nice and tidy, we are going to do some refining of our project's structure before starting with this project. Create the following folders:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

<code class="literal">Materials</code>
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Place the scene from the previous chapter in your <code class="literal">Scenes</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Next, move the terrain object and <code class="literal">Terrain Assets</code> folder to the <code class="literal">Terrains</code> folder, so everything having to do with our terrains is in one place.</p></li><li><p>Place your tree prefab we made in the <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Place the scripts from <code class="literal">Standard Assets\Character Controllers\Sources\Scripts</code> to your <code class="literal">Scripts</code> folder (optionally in a folder called <code class="literal">Character</code>).</p></li><li><p>Move the <code class="literal">First Person Controller</code> prefab to the <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder. </p></li><li><p>Move the <code class="literal">Skyboxes</code> and <code class="literal">Water</code> folders to the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder, deleting the <code class="literal">Daylight Simple Water</code> prefab and moving the <code class="literal">Nighttime Simple Water</code> prefab to the <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> folder.</p></li><li><p>Finally, delete the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> folder now that there are no files inside it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note59"></a>Note</h3><p>Astute readers may notice that the <code class="literal">Water</code> folder has more content including a script inside it.

There are many different ways out there to create levels. By default, Unity gives us some default meshes, such as a <span class="strong"><strong>Box</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span>, and while it's technically possible to build a level in that way, it could get really tedious really quickly. Next, I'm going to quickly go through the most popular options to build levels for games made in Unity before we jump into building a level of our own.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec04"></a>3D modeling software</h4></div></div></div><p>A lot of times, opening a 3D modeling software package and building architecture that way is what professional games studios will often do. This gives you maximum freedom in creating your environment and allows you to do exactly what you'd like to do. However, that requires you to be proficient in that tool, whether that be Maya, 3ds Max, Blender (which can be downloaded for free at <a class="ulink" href="http://blender.org" target="_blank">blender.org</a>), or some other tool. Then, you just need to export your models and import them into Unity.</p><p>Unity supports a lot of different formats for 3D models, but there are a lot of issues to consider. For some best practices, when it comes to creating art assets, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/" target="_blank">http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec05"></a>Constructing geometry with brushes</h4></div></div></div><p>Using <span class="strong"><strong>Constructive Solid Geometry</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSG</strong></span>), commonly referred to as brushes, has been a long-existing way for games to have in-game level editors, which has led to people creating levels for them. Tools such as Unreal Engine 4, Hammer, Radiant, and other professional game engines make use of this building structure, making it quite easy for people to create and iterate through levels quickly through a process called white-boxing, as it's very easy to make changes to simple shapes. However, just like learning a modeling software tool, there can be a higher barrier to entry in using brushes to create your geometry, but for those creating certain types of games where you need to create a lot of different content, it can be a great tool.</p><p>Unity does not support building things like this by default, but there are several tools in the Unity Asset Store that allow you to do something like this. For example, sixbyseven studio has an extension called ProBuilder, which can add this functionality to Unity, making it very easy to build levels (it's what I use normally when building environments for 3D games in Unity). However, as an extension, you'll need to buy it either from them or through the Asset Store, as it is not free. You can find out more information about ProBuilder at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec06"></a>Modular tilesets</h4></div></div></div><p>Another way to generate architecture is through the use of tiles that are created by an artist. You can use them to build your level. Similar to using LEGO pieces, we can use these tiles to snap together walls and other objects to create a building. With creative uses of tiles, you can create a large amount of content with just a minimal amount of assets. This is probably the easiest way to create a level at the expense of not being able to create unique-looking buildings since you only have a few pieces to work with.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec01"></a>Mix and match</h5></div></div></div><p>Of course, it's also possible to use a mixture of the tools mentioned to get the advantages of certain ways of doing things. For example, you could use brushes to block out an area (which is why it is called greyboxing) and then use a group of tiles called a tileset to replace boxes with highly detailed models, which is what a lot of AAA studios do, using the boxes just for their collision. In addition, we could also place tiles initially and then add in props to break up the repetitiveness of levels, which is what we are going to do.</p></div></div></div></div>
