Here are some ideas to get your mind thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create the layout for your game project. Try to create interesting areas, which you can use for encounters later on in the game.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Place the props in interesting ways to break up repetition.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Instead of having box colliders for every tile in our game, it would be much more efficient to just create box colliders for all the walls that are together.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>One of the major tools that level designers have is lighting. With it, we can create a mood or feeling in a place using the color, intensity, or even the lack of light. Players, in general, tend to follow lights, and you can use that as a level designer to help lead players along. Try using this in your level to lead players to the end of your level!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Currently, the doors do not do anything. Add a trigger to the door (box collider with <span class="strong"><strong>Is Trigger</strong></span> toggled), so when the player gets near a door, it will disappear. Once the player leaves the trigger, make it visible again. In addition, you can have a sound play when the door disappears to signify that the door has opened.</p></li></ul></div></div>
