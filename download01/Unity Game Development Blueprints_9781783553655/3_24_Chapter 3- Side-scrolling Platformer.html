In this chapter, we will explore how we can use the concepts that we learned in 2D and use them with a 3D game with 2D gameplay.</p><p>As long as<a id="id158" class="indexterm"></a> we have played games, there has been one particular genre that has stayed with us almost from the beginning, the platformer. Starting with <span class="emphasis"><em>Donkey Kong</em></span> with the familiar content that we know, refined in <span class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Brothers</em></span>, given more action with <span class="emphasis"><em>Mega Man</em></span>, taken faster with <span class="emphasis"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></span>, and used even today with games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Terraria</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Super Meat Boy</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Child of Light</em></span>, there is something that draws us to this specific type of game, especially within the indie game community.</p><p>A <a id="id159" class="indexterm"></a>platform game (known commonly as a platformer) consists of a player controlling a character that can move around a game environment with extensive jumping between platforms, hence the name.</p></div>
