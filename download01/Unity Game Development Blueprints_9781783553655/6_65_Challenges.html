Here are some ideas to get you thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Right now, the enemy will continue following you even if you're through a tree or a wall. Use the <code class="literal">Raycast</code> function we talked about in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Side-scrolling Platformer</em></span>, to check a line from the player when the enemy collides with something. If it does, then set the enemy's state to <code class="literal">Idle</code>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>If you're interested in adding in more complex AI behavior to your ghost, such as pathfinding, you can check out <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity 4.x Game AI Programming</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Aung Sithu Kyaw, Clifford Peters, and Thet Naing Swe</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add sound effects to the ghost character so that the player knows when they are coming closer to the player, and add some tension to the game. Adding in other sound effects, such as those for taking a picture and walking around, can help create ambience as well. A good website to visit for sound effects<a id="id532" class="indexterm"></a> is <a class="ulink" href="https://www.freesound.org/" target="_blank">https://www.freesound.org/</a>. However, you may need to edit them a bit to help make them fit the game better. To do that, I suggest <a id="id533" class="indexterm"></a>Audacity, which you can download from <a class="ulink" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in multiple ghosts in the level to create interesting encounters for the player to work with.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In addition, you could create additional ghosts, which can be faster and/or more aggressive. You could also use Unity's Culling Mask system to make the ghosts only visible if you have the camera out by putting the object on different layers (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/Layers.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/Layers.html</a>). Then, you can set the culling <a id="id534" class="indexterm"></a>mask for each camera to only display the layers that you want (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Camera.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Camera.html</a>).</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In the last section, you saw that we set a couple of different objects to make sure the game worked correctly. That's the most efficient way performance-wise, but for<a id="id535" class="indexterm"></a> convenience, you may want to get the objects through code with the <code class="literal">GameObject.Find</code> function. For more information about it, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.Find.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.Find.html</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div>
