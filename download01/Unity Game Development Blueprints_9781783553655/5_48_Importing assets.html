This will be useful to know, because unlike a landscape, we can use straight floors and more structure as most houses are that way, and we will use models to build the environment!</p><p>To show how easy it is to use, let's get started. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Start off by going to the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder in the <code class="literal">Project</code> tab, and create two new materials by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Material</strong></span>. Give one of the new materials the name <code class="literal">House</code> and the other, <code class="literal">Props</code>. Once you have that created go to your example code folder and move over the <code class="literal">2048_House_TEX.jpg</code> and<code class="literal"> 2048_Props_TEX.jpg</code> files. Once you've done that, apply that texture to the materials. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Create a new folder in our <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder named <code class="literal">Models</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note60"></a>Note</h3><p>Optionally, you can move the models from the <code class="literal">Terrain Assets</code> folder to here as well, but as we aren't using them anymore, I didn't.</p></div><p>John Espiritu has very kindly provided some models in modular pieces for us to work with. So, the next thing we will do is actually import those models.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note61"></a>Note</h3><p>For more info on John's stuff or to commission him yourself, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://raynehaize.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://raynehaize.tumblr.com/</a> or <a class="ulink" href="http://raynehaize.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">http://raynehaize.deviantart.com/</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>With the <code class="literal">Models</code> folder selected, let's import the models by dragging-and-dropping the <code class="literal">Modular Pieces</code> and<code class="literal"> Props</code> folders in it. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Back in Unity, move to the <code class="literal">Modular Pieces</code> folder in the <code class="literal">Project</code> tab. At this point, it should look somewhat as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>By default, Unity attempts to do some things automatically for us, which creates a lot of stuff we don't need for simple environment pieces like this. Select all the objects in this folder by selecting the <code class="literal">Ceiling 01</code> object, hold down the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key, and then select the <code class="literal">Wall Plain</code> object. This will bring you to <span class="strong"><strong>Model Importer</strong></span>. Once you are in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab, you will see three tabs you can select:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span>: It contains settings to import the model. For information, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span>: It has settings that will either allow the model to support animation or not. For more information, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Rig.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Rig.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span>: It has settings to import different animations from the model file. For more information, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Animations.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Animations.html</a>.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> tab, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Factor</strong></span> to <code class="literal">.025</code>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Scale Factor</strong></span> property allows you to apply a scalar to the model that you've imported. This is fine for this project, but generally, when working with animations, changing the scale factor may hurt your rig. So, be sure you have your artist create art at the correct scale.</p></li><li><p>Next, uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Import Models</strong></span> option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> section. After that, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button.</p><p>If left checked, Unity will have each object use its own material, which is intended to have its own texture. All of our pieces use the same texture, so there's no need to have multiple textures.</p></li><li><p>Select the <span class="strong"><strong>Rig</strong></span> tab, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Type</strong></span> to <code class="literal">None</code>, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p><p>If the object has animation, it will attempt to add an Avatar and more, which is unnecessary for this. Note that now the <span class="strong"><strong>Animations</strong></span> tab will be grayed out, because we have no animations.</p></li><li><p>Delete the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder inside the <code class="literal">Modular Pieces</code> folder.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note62"></a>Note</h3><p>When exporting an FBX file, it exports your model with UV coordinates but doesn't include the textures in the FBX file. You have to import your textures separately into Unity and add it to the material generated or assign it on your own.</p><p>As of this version of Unity, there is no way to have models not generate a material by default, hence our need to delete them. We will add materials to these models when we create their prefabs.</p></div></li><li><p>Repeat steps 5-8 with the <code class="literal">Props</code> folder as well. Once you finish, the folder should look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_04.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, we have our models in the project! This is a great first step, but it's useless unless it's actually in the game world. Let's get started with that now.</p></div>
