<span class="strong"><strong>Grid snapping</strong></span> is<a id="id364" class="indexterm"></a> a really useful tool when it comes to <a id="id365" class="indexterm"></a>building stuff inside Unity. Instead of <a id="id366" class="indexterm"></a>punching in numbers all the time when trying to set the positions of all of these tiles, we can just set <a id="id367" class="indexterm"></a>our <span class="strong"><strong>Snap</strong></span> size to be the size of our tiles <code class="literal">3.2</code> x <code class="literal">3.2</code> x <code class="literal">3.2</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note65"></a>Note</h3><p>In addition to movement, we can also snap rotations and scaling.</p></div></li><li><p>Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Snap Settings</strong></span>; we can change the value to snap easily by changing<a id="id368" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Move</strong></span> of<a id="id369" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> to <code class="literal">3.2</code> and<a id="id370" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Move</strong></span> of <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> to <code class="literal">3.561</code>, taking into account the wall's thickness.</p></li><li><p>Now that we have the snap settings working correctly, we will place a hallway to start our level and reset its <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> property to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>).</p></li><li><p>Next, duplicate the mesh by hitting <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>, and then, holding <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span>, drag the tile over to the right-hand side to continue the hallway.</p></li><li><p>After that I'm going to create a couple of other hallways and then place two <span class="strong"><strong>Hall Door</strong></span> prefabs to fill out the area, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_14.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Now, we need to create a few rooms. Open your rooms prefab and from the top viewport, place your middle piece in front of each doorway by first dragging it out, resetting<a id="id371" class="indexterm"></a> its position, and then holding down <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> and snapping it there.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note66"></a>Note</h3><p>Another way of placing assets in this way would be to place floors first wherever you want to create your layout and then spawning walls around the edges.</p></div></li><li><p>Next, use<a id="id372" class="indexterm"></a> the correct <span class="strong"><strong>Room</strong></span> <a id="id373" class="indexterm"></a>tiles to fill out <a id="id374" class="indexterm"></a>your rooms as you want them to look. Start with using your <span class="strong"><strong>Top Left</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Top</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Right</strong></span> prefabs. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_15.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note67"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember that once you place the object for the first time, all you need to do is duplicate, which should make it extremely quick to build (or prototype) levels.</p></div><p>Once we get over the wall, you'll remember that normal tiles are still <code class="literal">3.2</code>, so modify <span class="strong"><strong>Move</strong></span> of <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> as needed to <code class="literal">3.2</code> or <code class="literal">3.6</code> accordingly. You can also assemble tiles by making use of the vertex snapping tool. Basically, you can take any vertex of a mesh, and with your mouse, place that vertex in the same position as a vertex from any other mesh.</p></li><li><p>Select the<a id="id375" class="indexterm"></a> mesh <a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a>you want to <a id="id377" class="indexterm"></a>manipulate, and make sure the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> <a id="id378" class="indexterm"></a>tool is active. Press and hold <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> to enter the vertex snapping mode. Move your cursor over the vertex on the mesh you want to use as the pivot point. Hold down the left button once your cursor is over the desired vertex, and drag your mesh next to any other vertex on another mesh. You should see the object moving around via your input.</p></li><li><p>Release your mouse button and the <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> key when you are happy with the results. This should make it really easy to build out the rest of the rooms, but make sure you check at multiple angles to make sure the part is placed in the right area.</p></li><li><p>For the sake of trying it out, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hall Door</strong></span> prefab inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, and you should see a little button to the right of the image of the prefab. Once there, click on it to have all the children objects show up so that we can modify them. From there, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Door</strong></span> object and uncheck the <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span> component. This way, you can walk through the doors to see the rooms. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_16.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Using these<a id="id379" class="indexterm"></a> same<a id="id380" class="indexterm"></a> tools and a<a id="id381" class="indexterm"></a> little trial and error, you can create a large <a id="id382" class="indexterm"></a>amount of variety in your environments, such as the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_05_17.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>Finally, create an empty game object, name it <code class="literal">Level 01</code>, and then assign all the rooms to it as children.</p></li></ol></div><p>And there we<a id="id383" class="indexterm"></a> go! We now know how to <a id="id384" class="indexterm"></a>build out rooms using <a id="id385" class="indexterm"></a>tiles and vertex<a id="id386" class="indexterm"></a> snapping!</p></div>
