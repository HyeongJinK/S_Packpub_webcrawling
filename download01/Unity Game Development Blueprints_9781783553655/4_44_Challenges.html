Here are some ideas to get you thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add additional trees and textures to make the level appear even more realistic.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Right now, the player can go down into the water and get stuck. Add a new trigger, so that whenever the player hits it, it will reset his/her position back to the starting position.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Have someone play your game and see if they can navigate your environment to where you want to lead them.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Once you learn how to create encounters, add some additional combat experiences in this level.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create collectibles that the player can collect in the level, in the same manner as the platformer project we did in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Side-scrolling Platformer</em></span>, to reward the player travelling the map. Adding a light can help players know where to travel.</p></li></ul></div></div>
