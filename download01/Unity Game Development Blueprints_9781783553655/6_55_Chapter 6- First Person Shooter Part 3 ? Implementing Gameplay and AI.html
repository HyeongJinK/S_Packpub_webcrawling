Now, to some people, the card game <span class="emphasis"><em>War</em></span><a id="id430" class="indexterm"></a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)</a>) is <a id="id431" class="indexterm"></a>a game; however, the game is already determined before anyone actually plays the game since players have absolutely no interactions besides flipping cards.</p><p>Renowned game programmer and designer Sid Meier says that a game is "a series of interesting choices," and I really like that definition. At my alma mater and current employer DigiPen, we were taught that a video game was a real-time interactive simulation.</p><p>Having an environment is an excellent first step towards creating your game project; but, without anything to do but look around, this is a real-time simulation but it's not very interactive.</p></div>
