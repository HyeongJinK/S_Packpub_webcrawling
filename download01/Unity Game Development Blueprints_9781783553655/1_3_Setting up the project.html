Select <span class="strong"><strong>Project Location</strong></span> of your choice somewhere on your hard drive, and ensure you have <span class="strong"><strong>Setup defaults for</strong></span> set to <code class="literal">2D</code>. Once completed, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span>. At this point, we will not need to import any packages, as we'll be making everything from scratch. It should look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_2.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>From <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>there, if you see the <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome to Unity</strong></span> pop up, feel free to close it out as we won't be using it. At this point, you will be brought to the general Unity layout, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_3.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"></a>Note</h3><p>Again, I'm assuming you have some familiarity with Unity before reading this book; if you would like more information on the interface, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/LearningtheInterface.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/LearningtheInterface.html</a>.</p></div><p>Keeping<a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a> your Unity project organized is incredibly important. As your project moves from a small prototype to a full game, more and more files will be introduced to your project. If you don't start organizing from the beginning, you'll keep planning to tidy it up later on, but as deadlines keep coming, things may get quite out of hand.</p><p>This organization becomes even more vital when you're working as part of a team, especially if your team is telecommuting. Differing project structures across different coders/artists/designers is an awful mess to find yourself in.</p><p>Setting up a project structure at the start and sticking to it will save you countless minutes of time in the long run and only takes a few seconds, which is what we'll be doing now. Perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> drop-down menu below the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab in the bottom-left side of the screen.</p></li><li><p>From there, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span>, and you'll notice that a new folder has been created inside your <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> folder.</p></li><li><p>After<a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a> the folder is created, you can type in the name for your folder. Once done, press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> for the folder to be created. We need to create folders for the following directories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Animations</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>

<code class="literal">Scenes</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Scripts</code>
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="literal">Sprites</code>
</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"></a>Note</h3><p>If you happen to create a folder inside another folder, you can simply drag-and-drop it from the left-hand side toolbar. If you need to rename a folder, simply click on it once and wait, and you'll be able to edit it again.</p><p>You can also use <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> to duplicate a folder if it is selected.</p></div></li><li><p>Once you're done with the aforementioned steps, your project should look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_01_4.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div>
