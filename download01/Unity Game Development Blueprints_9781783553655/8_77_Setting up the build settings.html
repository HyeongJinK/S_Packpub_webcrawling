<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec76"></a>Setting up the build settings</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>There are many times during<a id="id631" class="indexterm"></a> development that you may want to see what your game looks like if you build it outside of the editor. It can give you a sense of accomplishment; I know, I felt that way the first time I pushed a build to a console devkit. Whether it's for PC, Mac, Linux, web player, mobile, or console, we all have to go through the same menu, the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu. We perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>We are going to first open our <code class="literal">Twinstick Shooter</code> project that we created back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>2D Twin-stick Shooter</em></span>, <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating GUIs</em></span>, and <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Save Files in Unity</em></span>. Open up your main menu scene (in the example code, it is saved as <code class="literal">Main_Menu</code>). Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>To access our <a id="id632" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu, we will need to navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the top menu (or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>). Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>If you have been <a id="id633" class="indexterm"></a>following thoroughly from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating GUIs</em></span>, you should see two icons in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> section. If you have not, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> button.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note84"></a>Note</h3><p>Another way to add levels to your build is to just drag-and-drop them from the project browser. It's also important to note that you can also drag them around to order them however you want. The level that is at index <code class="literal">0</code> will be the one that the game starts with.</p></div></li><li><p>Now, we are going to use the map that we created in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Save Files in Unity</em></span>, so left-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter_2</strong></span> scene, and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span> key to remove it.</p></li><li><p>Then open the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter_7</strong></span> map, go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add Current</strong></span> again; alternatively, you can drag-and-drop the scene files as well.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we no longer want to open up the <span class="strong"><strong>Chapter_2</strong></span> level, so open up our <code class="literal">MainMenuGUI.cs</code> script in MonoDevelop, and change the <code class="literal">2</code> to <code class="literal">7</code> in the <code class="literal">LoadLevel</code> function call.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note85"></a>Note</h3><p>For future projects, you may make a string variable to hold the name of the level for the button to go to, and just change it inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab.</p></div></li><li><p>Once you're ready, select <a id="id634" class="indexterm"></a>a platform from the bottom-left corner menu. The Unity logo shows which one you're currently compiling for. We're going to compile for Windows now, so if it is currently not set to <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong></span>, select that, and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button.</p></li><li><p>Once you have all this set up, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button. Once this is done, it will ask you for a name and a location to put the game in. I'm going to name it <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter</code> and put it in an <code class="literal">Export</code> folder located in the same directory as the <code class="literal">Assets</code> and <code class="literal">Library</code> folder. Afterward, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You may need to wait a bit, but as soon as it finishes, it will open up the folder with your new game. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_04.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>When building for Windows, you<a id="id635" class="indexterm"></a> should get something like the preceding screenshot. We have the executable, but we also have a data folder that contains all the assets for our application (right now called <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter_Data</code>). You must include the data folder with your game, or it will not run. This is a slight pain, but later on in this chapter, we will create an installer so that we can put it on a computer without any hassle.</p><p>If you build for Mac, it will bundle the app and data all together, so once you export it, all you need to give people is the application.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note86"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are interested in submitting your Mac game to the <a id="id636" class="indexterm"></a>Mac App Store, there is a nice tutorial about doing just that at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html" target="_blank">http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html</a>.</p></div><p>If you double-click on the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file to run the game, you'll be brought to the following startup menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_05.jpg" /></div><p>This will allow players to customize <a id="id637" class="indexterm"></a>their <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Resolution</strong></span> values as well as other options, such as what buttons to use for input. I personally feel this menu makes projects look more unprofessional, so I'll be teaching you how to remove this as well.</p><p>Anyway, once we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play!</strong></span> button, we'll be taken to the proper game screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781783553655/graphics/3655OT_08_06.jpg" /></div><p>And it's working great. We <a id="id638" class="indexterm"></a>can work at any resolution that we choose, and all the menus are functioning as well!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note87"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on publishing<a id="id639" class="indexterm"></a> and specific things to look out for, check out the following link:</p><p>
