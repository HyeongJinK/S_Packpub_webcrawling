In shoot 'em ups, the player character <a id="id0" class="indexterm"></a>is a single entity fighting a large number of enemies. They are typically played with a top-down perspective, which is perfect for 2D games. Shoot 'em up games also exist with many categories, based upon their design elements.</p><p>Elements of a shoot 'em up were first seen in the 1961 <span class="emphasis"><em>Spacewar!</em></span> game. However, the concept wasn't popularized until 1978 with <span class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span>. The genre was quite popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s and went in many different directions, including <span class="emphasis"><em>bullet hell</em></span> games, such as the titles <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>of the Touhou Project. The genre has recently gone through a resurgence in recent years with games such as Bizarre Creations' <span class="emphasis"><em>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</em></span>, which is more famously known as a twin-stick shooter.</p></div>
