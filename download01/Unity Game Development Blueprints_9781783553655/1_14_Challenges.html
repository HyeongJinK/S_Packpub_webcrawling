Here are some ideas to get your mind thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in feedback whenever the player hits an enemyâ€”perhaps an animation or a change of sprites.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give the player lives, and each time he is hit by an enemy, have him lose one life. Add a GUI Text to display lives as well.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Once you learn how to use a <span class="strong"><strong>Game State Manager</strong></span>, create a main menu, pause screen, and restart button.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in Xbox control and mobile touch support.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As a learning experiment, convert the player shooting behaviour code to use co-routines to enable/disable being able to shoot. Discuss the advantages/disadvantages towards this method.</p></li></ul></div></div>
