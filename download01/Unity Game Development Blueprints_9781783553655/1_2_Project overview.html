This ship can move around the screen using the keyboard and shoot projectiles in the direction that the mouse points at. Enemies and obstacles will spawn toward the player, and the player will avoid/shoot them. This chapter will also serve as a refresher on a lot of the concepts of working in Unity and give an overview of the recent addition of native 2D tools into Unity.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"></a>Your objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>This project <a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a>will be split into a number of tasks.

These can be downloaded from the example code provided for this book on Packt Publishing's website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.PacktPub.com" target="_blank">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>).</p><p>Navigate<a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a> to the preceding URL, and download the <code class="literal">Chapter1.zip</code> package and unzip it. Inside the <code class="literal">Chapter1</code> folder, there are a number of things, including an <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder, which will have the art, sound, and font files you'll need for the project as well as the <code class="literal">Chapter_1_Completed.unitypackage</code> (this is the complete chapter package that includes the entire project for you to work with). I've also added in the complete game exported (<code class="literal">TwinstickShooter Exported</code>) as well as the entire project zipped up in the <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter Project.zip</code> file.</p></div></div>
