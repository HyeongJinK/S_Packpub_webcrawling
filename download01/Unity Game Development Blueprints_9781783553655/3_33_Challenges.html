Here are some ideas to get your mind thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in sounds and music to the game, and customize the GUI in the ways we talked about earlier.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create levels of your own. Danny Calleri has created a really nice level editor called Toast Editor<a id="id246" class="indexterm"></a> that you can run from your web browser to design levels graphically. To use it, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://dannycalleri.github.io/toasteditor/index.html" target="_blank">http://dannycalleri.github.io/toasteditor/index.html</a>. When exporting, use the C++ option, and replace the top line with our levels line, and add <code class="literal">new int []</code> to<a id="id247" class="indexterm"></a> the beginning of every line in the array.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Going one step further, instead of creating arrays for the levels, it is possible to load in text files in Unity so that you can load the levels from a file. For more information on <a id="id248" class="indexterm"></a>text assets, see <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As it stands, when the player hits one of the orbs, they can jump again. Adding an additional <a id="id249" class="indexterm"></a>parameter to the <code class="literal">Raycast</code> function with the tag of the object will solve the issue.</p></li></ul></div></div>
