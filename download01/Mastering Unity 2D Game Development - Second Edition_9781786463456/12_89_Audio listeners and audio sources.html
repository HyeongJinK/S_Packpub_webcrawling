The audio source is the object that emits the sound and the audio listener is the object that receives the sound.</p><p>Any object in your scene can be turned into an audio source or listener by attaching the corresponding component to it. However, you will notice that the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code> always comes with an <code class="literal">Audio Listener</code> component automatically added to it when a new scene is created. The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> for the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code> from our <code class="literal">BattleScene</code>:</p><p>

</p><p>Since we will be working in a 2D game the object that we use as our audio source is not terribly important. If we were working in a 3D game and wanted our sound to be 3D (that is, the distance the object is away from the audio listener will affect the sound's volume), we'd want the object actually making the sound to be the audio source.</p><p>My preference is to have two objects in my game that are carried between scenes and act as audio sources. I use one object as the audio source for the music in the game and the other as the audio source for all sound effects. This allows me to easily mute the sound and music separately.</p></div>
