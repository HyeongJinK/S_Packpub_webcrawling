In the previous chapter, we set up the general logic of the turn-based system and designed the HUD to allow our player to select an attack, but our player cannot actually attack any of the enemies yet and they do not attack her. Let's allow our player and our enemies to fight each other.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>What it means to battle</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Planning for longevity</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Enhancing the enemy AI</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Particle systems in 2D</p></li></ul></div></div>
