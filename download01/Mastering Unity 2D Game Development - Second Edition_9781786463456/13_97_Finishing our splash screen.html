<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch13lvl1sec91"></a>Finishing our splash screen</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Open the scene created in the last chapter that functioned as our splash screen, <code class="literal">SplashScreen.unity</code>. Currently, this screen simply displays for 1 second and starts playing the music. Let's get a little fancier and add a logo to the scene. Usually I use this screen to show my company's logo zooming in for 3 seconds.</p><p>For this example, I am going to just have the Packt Publishing logo display for 3 seconds. Add the following <code class="literal">packt.png</code> image to the <code class="literal">Assets/Sprites/UI</code> folder:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now change the <span class="strong"><strong>Background</strong></span> color of the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code> to white.</p><p>Drag the <code class="literal">packt.png</code> image to your scene and set its <span class="strong"><strong>Transform Position</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0,0,0</code>.</p><p>Right now, if we were to play the game, the image would show for 1 second and then the <code class="literal">Town</code> scene would open. We want this to transition to the <code class="literal">StartScreen</code> after 3 seconds. So, select the <code class="literal">Main Camera</code>, and change the settings on the <code class="literal">SplashScreen</code> script as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>We have not yet added the <code class="literal">StartScreen</code> to our build settings, so do so now; otherwise, we will get an error when we attempt to play the game. It doesn't matter what position in the list you place the <code class="literal">StartScreen</code>, but I prefer to have it as my second scene. As shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now when we play the game, the Packt Publishing logo will display for 3 seconds, the music will begin, and we will be taken to the blank <code class="literal">StartScreen</code>.</p></div>
