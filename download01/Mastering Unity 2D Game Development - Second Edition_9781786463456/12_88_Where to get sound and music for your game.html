You can make the audio yourself, you can hire composers, you can purchase stock audio, or you can even use free stock audio.</p><p>If you purchase stock audio or use free stock audio, be sure to check the licensing agreement. Purchasing audio does not automatically guarantee you unrestricted use and sometimes, even if you pay for it, you cannot use it in a commercial game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec145"></a>Free resources</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're like me, free is probably the price range you are looking for. What follows is a list of a few places where you can get free resources to help you design your own audio or get pre-existing sound effects/music:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Audacity is free software and can be downloaded at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">http://www.audacityteam.org/</a>. This software can be great for recording your own sound effects and dialog.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>My favorite place to get music is <a class="ulink" href="http://incompetech.com/" target="_blank">incompetech.com/</a>. You can sort the music by feel and genre and there is a huge selection of quality music available here. Make sure that you check the licensing info on this, because the artist does require credit when using his material.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Free sound effects are a little harder to come by. <a class="ulink" href="http://freesound.org" target="_blank">Freesound.org</a> is a good place to get sound effects. Each sound effect has a different license agreement, so make sure you check that out before downloading.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Always check out the Unity Asset Store when you're looking for any resource, at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com</a>. While there aren't many free assets in terms of sound or music, there are a few and the store gets new items daily.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
