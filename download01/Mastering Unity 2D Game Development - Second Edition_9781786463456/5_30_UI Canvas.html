<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec32"></a>UI Canvas</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>UI Canvas</strong></span> is essentially the object that holds all of your UI elements. You can manually add a UI Canvas or it will be automatically added to your scene when you add any other UI element. All UI elements, including the UI Canvas, can be added by the <span class="strong"><strong>Create </strong></span>menu in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. All of your UI elements will be children of your canvas. When you add a Canvas to the scene, the <span class="strong"><strong>EventSystem</strong></span> object will also be added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. This object allows you to use buttons and the other UI components in an interactive way, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>When you first start using Canvases, you may become a little confused by the location of your Canvas and the objects that are actually in your scene. When you first create a Canvas, you should see a large rectangle appear in your scene, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Double-click on the canvas in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> to zoom out your scene view to see the full canvas, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This large size of the canvas lets you easily see all the elements that will be in your UI without the objects in your actual scene cluttering your view.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec54"></a>EventSystem</h3></div></div></div><p>As stated previously, when you create a Canvas, a GameObject called <span class="strong"><strong>EventSystem</strong></span> will be added to the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. This is an empty GameObject that will hold a few scripts, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The EventSystem is a built-in functionality that lets you send events to objects based on some type of input. When using UI, you need this so that your mouse inputs will work on the respective UI element. For example, this functionality allows you to use the <code class="literal">OnClick()</code> functionality of a button (described in the UI Buttons section).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"></a>Canvas Render Mode</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the most important aspects of Canvases, in my opinion, is the ability to change the <span class="strong"><strong>Render Modes</strong></span>. These modes essentially determine how or if the various objects in your Canvas will scale and position when the camera size changes. Setting this property correctly will make the process of publishing to multiple platforms significantly easier, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>There are three different render modes: <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Camera</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec18"></a>Screen Space - Overlay</h4></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span> rendering mode will make the objects in your UI automatically scale based on the resolution of the game. It does not consider the camera. The following screenshot shows the properties you can edit when using the <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space-Overlay</strong></span> rendering mode:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Every object in the UI will render in front of all objects within the world, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_007.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Screen Space-Overlay Canvas Render Mode example provided by Unity's Manual</p></div></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec19"></a>Screen Space - Camera</h4></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Camera</strong></span> mode is similar to that of <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span>, but instead of being completely independent of the camera, it renders all UI objects as if they are a specific distance away from the camera. The following screenshot shows the properties you can edit when using the <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Camera</strong></span> rendering mode:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You can see in the preceding screenshot that for this rendering mode to work correctly, you have to specify which camera will be used to determine how the objects render, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_009.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Screen Space-Camera Canvas Render Mode example provided by Unity's Manual</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>This mode is particularly helpful if you want to have a background image in your 2D game that will automatically scale with the camera.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec20"></a>World Space</h4></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> rendering mode allows you to render the UI elements as if they are on a plane positioned within the 3D space of the scene. The position and rotation of these elements can be set through the Canvas's <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>. They will scale based on their location relative to the camera. The following screenshot shows the properties you can edit when using the <span class="strong"><strong>World Space</strong></span> rendering mode:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>This rendering mode is great for UI elements that appear in a 3D game view, such as health bars that float over characters' heads and damage or health text that pop up in the scene, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec56"></a>Using multiple Canvases</h3></div></div></div><p>You are not restricted to using a single canvas. You can have as many Canvases as you like and each can have their own render mode. This can be very helpful if you need different UI items to render in different modes. For example, you may want to put <span class="strong"><strong>Heads-Up-Display</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HUD</strong></span>) UI elements in a canvas with a <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Overlay</strong></span> rendering mode and a background image in a Canvas with a <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Space - Camera</strong></span> rendering mode. You can even place Canvases as children of other Canvases, if you want to get fancy!</p><p>In general, if you have multiple Canvases with the same rendering mode and you haven't fiddled with their sorting order, Canvases will appear so that the one positioned lowest in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy's</strong></span> list will render in front.</p></div></div>
