In this case, just all the folders we will commonly use in any Unity project are shown here:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_14_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>With that in place, just navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Export Package</strong></span> from the Unity editor menu, and you will be presented with the following window:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_14_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Here, you can select all the assets currently in your project that you want bundled up in your own reusable Unity asset package. Once you are happy with your selection, just click on <span class="strong"><strong>Export...</strong></span>. Then, Unity will simply ask where you want your package to be created:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_14_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>There you have it! Once saved, you will simply have your new asset package, which you can reuse on every project or even publish to the asset store and make millions (well probably not if it's just a bunch of folders; you might need a bit more than that). This package can be named as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">MyDefaultFolderStructure.unitypackage &#13;
