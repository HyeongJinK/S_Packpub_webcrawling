We will start with setting up the project and then move on to building the main character. Setting up the main character is an important first step, as most of your game's core logic and framework generally centers on the main protagonist and highlights exactly how the player will interact with the game.</p><p>We will be creating two main locations for the character to explore: a 2.5D town in which she can interact with <span class="strong"><strong>Non-Playable Characters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>s) and a world map in which she will encounter and battle enemies. To allow our character to interact with and explore these locations, we must first get our character into our project and give her the ability to move around the scenes. We must also get our project started the right way by setting up the project appropriately.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Designing a good project structure</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating a project and scenes</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Importing Sprites</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Working with classes and components</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Planning and designing behaviors</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up user control effectively</p></li></ul></div></div>
