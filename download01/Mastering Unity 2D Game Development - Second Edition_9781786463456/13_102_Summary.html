With these tools in hand, we can keep building our games a lot easier and customize Unity to fit our game (rather than the other way around). The editor is there to help us build our game, so why not improve it?</p><p>Several developers graciously share their editor scripts and work in open source libraries, so be sure to look around; in many cases, you don't need to start from scratch.</p><p>We covered editor customization, property drawers, custom editors, editor windows, and Gizmos. We also covered architecting the game package with screens and menus and working with saving and loading data.</p><p>In the next chapter, we look at packaging the game on to several platforms, extending our game out on to the platform itself, and providing platform-specific features in the game.</p></div>
