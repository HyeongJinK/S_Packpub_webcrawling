A few recommendations are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Have the player and Dragons animate when attacking by moving them forward slightly</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give the Dragons floating health bars</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give the more powerful attacks a time limit or use limit of some sort, so that the player doesn't spam the highest level attack</p></li></ul></div></div>
