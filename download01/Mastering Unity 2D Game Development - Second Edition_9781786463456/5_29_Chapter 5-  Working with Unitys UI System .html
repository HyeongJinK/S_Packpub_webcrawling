However, before we begin with that, I want to discuss the various features of the Unity UI system. This chapter will provide an overview of each of the elements available with the UI system and we will utilize them in the future chapters.</p><p>The UI system was implemented in <span class="strong"><strong>Unity 4.6</strong></span> and has made the incorporation of a UI system significantly easier than it was in the past. This UI system has essentially made any of the old GUI functions a thing of the past. These functions are still useful for procedurally generating a UI, but, for the most part, if you see a reference to GUI functions, it was written prior to version 4.6 and is handling UI in a much harder way than necessary.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI Canvas</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI Text and Images</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI Layout and Rect Transform</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>UI Buttons</p></li></ul></div></div>
