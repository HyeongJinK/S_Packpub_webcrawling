I've not covered everything as that would deserve another book entirely, so feel free to experiment further. The state machine system isn't just for animation either, and we will return to this later on.</p><p>We covered an overview of all the main sprite animation components (<span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Clips</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Keyframes</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Curves</strong></span>), importing new sprites, animating sprites, and controlling states.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will build an environment for our character to walk around and allow our camera to follow her.</p></div>
