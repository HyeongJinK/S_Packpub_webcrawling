While you can add interaction to them, for the most part, these will be static objects in your UI that display information to the player.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec57"></a>UI Text</h3></div></div></div><p>The UI Text object allows you to place blocks of text on the Canvas. From the Text component, which is automatically attached to any UI Text object you create, you can control all of the properties of the text, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_012.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You can also adjust these individual properties through code by accessing the <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span> component. The default font for all text is <span class="strong"><strong>Arial</strong></span>, but if you want to use any other font, you will have to import the font into your project.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec58"></a>UI Image</h3></div></div></div><p>When you create a UI Image, an object with the image component on it will be automatically added to your Canvas. It will initially appear as a white square until you replace the source image. The source image must have its <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> in its import settings set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> to be used as a UI Image. You can control all of the properties of the image, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_05_013.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note46"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember, if you are working in 2D mode, all images you bring into your project will automatically be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> texture type.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> property will work essentially like a color overlay if you change the color from white to a different color the image will be tinted based on the color you select. From the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> property, you can also adjust the image's transparency.</p><p>If for some reason you want to use an image in the UI that does not have its import <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>, but instead want to use an image that was imported as a <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>, you can use a <span class="strong"><strong>Raw Image</strong></span> UI object. However, the image UI object should be used in most cases. The following screenshot shows the properties of the <span class="strong"><strong>Raw Image</strong></span> UI element:</p><p>
