Designing an interesting and unique battle system is difficult. The battle system should be challenging and engaging. The challenge can be accomplished with enemies that level up as the player progresses or with enemies that acquire new and unique skills. The engagement can be achieved by quirky enemies, interesting animations, or many other ways.</p><p>There are several things you may wish to consider to include in your battle system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Animations</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Player actions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Enemy defenses and reactions</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Special moves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Interactions</p></li></ul></div><p>Each of these provides an engaging experience for the player and makes the battle feel worthwhile. When developing an RPG, I highly recommend you play many different RPGs and study the different ways in which the battle system has been developed. Determine which preceding element listed is important to you and plan to include it.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec117"></a>Leveling up</h3></div></div></div><p>It's important to ensure that the player feels they are achieving something as they progress. This may be, for instance, how much gold they collect from the fallen enemies to buy swanky new gear. It could also be about increasing the statistics or skills of the player, enabling them to take on more powerful enemies with a wave of their wrist.</p><p>Invariably, it is a mix of all of the preceding things that makes a game stand out. In fact, in some titles, this is the whole focus of the game; you spend lots of time planning what skills to have or upgrade as you progress on to explore/fight.</p><p>One piece of advice I would give is to ensure that you have some sort of whole-world experience system. You can have skills and strengths the player can use to affect the whole game; it should be about the game experience and not just the fight. Many big RPG games spend a lot of their development effort getting this right, but that's not to say this cannot be applied to smaller or even episodic games.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec118"></a>Balancing</h3></div></div></div><p>By far the most difficult thing to implement in any game is balancing. If done right, you will spend over 50 percent of your development efforts testing, tweaking, retesting, and retweaking the game.</p><p>Don't use just one focus group to test your game, but use people from all walks of life. The more people you have test your game, the better the balance of the game will be.</p><p>Finding that sweet spot between difficulty, playability, engagement, and fun is always hard, so do not underestimate it. Remember, just because you play the game in a certain way doesn't mean everyone else will play in the same way.</p></div></div>
