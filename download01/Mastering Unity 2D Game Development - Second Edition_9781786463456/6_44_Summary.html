This certainly has been the heaviest chapter so far, but there were a lot of advanced techniques to cover, and to do them justice, they needed a lot of explanation. Building a conversation system for any game needs a lot of planning to ensure you get the features you need for your game.</p><p>The lessons you learned in this chapter will set you in good stead for the future features.</p><p>We covered the ways to communicate between the GameObjects using events, delegates, and messaging solutions. We also covered working with background tasks and coroutines, serialization and scriptable objects, and constructing our own conversation system.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will set up a world map that will allow the player to go places other than the town in which she starts out.</p></div>
