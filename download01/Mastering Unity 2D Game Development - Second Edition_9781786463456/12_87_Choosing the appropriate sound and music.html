For me, this is harder than choosing art, because I know that choosing the wrong music could drastically bring down the appeal of my game. If the player finds your music choice annoying, too loud, or overbearing, their experience will be far from ideal. I recommend playing the music you chose over and over for yourself. If it annoys you after a few loops, it will definitely annoy the player.</p><p>Appropriate sound effects are also important. You want to make sure that all appropriate actions have sound and that the sound fits the action that it accompanies. You don't want the sound of breaking glass to accompany the action of a character sighing, for example. Too few sound effects can make your game feel incomplete and too many (especially triggering at the same time) can make your game seem muddled. It's also important that the sound doesn't get too repetitive, as this will become annoying quickly.</p><p>Just remember to play-test your game with many different types of people from many different walks of life and specifically ask them their opinion on the sound and music. Many players will mute the sound of a game before they even hear it, so if you are testing for sound and music, make sure the players know ahead of time.</p></div>
