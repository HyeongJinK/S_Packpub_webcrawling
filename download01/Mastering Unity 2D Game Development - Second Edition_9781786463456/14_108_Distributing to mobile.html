Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, distribution, and marketing.</p><p>Before you begin publishing, make sure you have all UI elements scaling correctly at various resolutions. Using a canvas with the anchor and pivot points properly placed helps with this. Android has many more screen resolutions than any other mobile platform and it is impossible for you to test on all resolutions, so making sure everything scales appropriately is essential.</p><p>To publish on iOS, you final game must be built on a Mac. To publish on Windows Phone, you final game must be built in Windows 10. To publish on Android, your final game can be built using either a Mac or Windows operating system. So, to build to all three platforms you need both a Windows 10 machine and a Mac with a current OS.</p><p>Each of the mobile platforms require you to sign up for their storefront; none of them allow you to do so for free. Android development costs the least amount of money upfront, with the total cost of a Google Play account only being $25 for a lifetime. Developing for iOS is the most expensive. You have to pay $99 a year to get an Apple Developer account. Microsoft is right in the middle in pricing. Its pricing varies by country, but it is around $20 per year for an individual account.</p></div>
