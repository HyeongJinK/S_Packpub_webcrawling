From a simple adventure game where we just pick things up off the street that may come in useful later, to full-fledged RPG games where the inventory is everything, this motivation is indispensable. Even <span class="strong"><strong>First Person Shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>) games aren't immune to this phenomenon.</p><p>It is important to keep all of this in mind and look at the real-world when designing any shopping/inventory system for your RPG game. The more it feels like something that someone would do in real life, the more at home they will feel with it, and the easier they will find to use it.</p><p>You should always be asking the following questions of yourself while designing such a system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>How does an item add value?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Does it seem affordable?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Is it going to improve the play?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Is it desirable?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Is it better to know what the player will already have and why?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Is it single-use (consumable) or fixed (durable/non-consumable)?</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Will it break or wear out over time?</p></li></ul></div><p>A lot of this leads us beyond just what is good for the game; it leads us to what is good for the player. Another factor that can lend weight to this is whether we are going to monetize certain powerful items. However, we will cover this in more detail later.</p></div>
