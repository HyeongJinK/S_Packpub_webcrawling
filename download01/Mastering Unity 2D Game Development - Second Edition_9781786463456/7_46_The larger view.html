So, we need to widen the scope of what the player can see and build a large map with places of interest to visit.</p><p>This usually opens the floodgates for just how big your game will be. Planning can decide whether your game will be a hit or feel just too short.</p><p>Maps in RPGs certainly aren't mandatory; several hit games just go from place to place with maybe an animation or cut scene to show movement. However, in the best cases, a map just opens up the scope of the game and gives the player an understanding of the world they are traveling in.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec83"></a>Types of map</h3></div></div></div><p>When looking at what kind of map or world you are going to choose to connect the dots between places to visit or secret hideaways, there are a few paths you can take. Generally, there are two options, which are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Fixed</strong></span>: In this option, images are usually drawn by an artist and have extensive detail of the world surrounding the player or are blank, exposing places as the player travels to or discovers them</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Generated</strong></span>: In this option, each run of the game completely randomizes the places to go or events that will take place, with the focus being on unpredictability</p></li></ul></div><p>Both the preceding options are perfectly valid and there's nothing to say you need to focus on just one or the other-mix it up if you wish. Generally, the greater the variety, the better the chances of the player being engaged in your game—it will entice them to explore and play more.</p><p>Another keen element is that it should support repeatability and replayability—let players return to existing locations and discover new things, and reuse what you have to the fullest.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec33"></a>Fixed maps</h4></div></div></div><p>There are many resources to get maps for your title if you don't have a dedicated artist and, in some ways, these also provide insight or creative juice for how you want your maps to look.</p><p>The first site to mention, primarily because it is also completely free, is <a class="ulink" href="http://freefantasymaps.org/" target="_blank">http://freefantasymaps.org/</a>. Another useful site is the <span class="strong"><strong>Cartographers' Guild</strong></span> at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cartographersguild.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cartographersguild.com/</a>. This is a veritable map paradise with lots of content available for use in most projects. Unlike the preceding site, all works are protected and you will need to purchase them or gain rights to use them. However, they are of a very high quality.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip77"></a>Tip</h3><p>When browsing maps and art, <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> be sure to check the license and usage policies of the images you download. This should be done whenever you acquire art, even from Google. Be safe, check, and get permission.</p><p>The same can be said for code and any other kind of asset. If in doubt, check the license and even if it's free, just check with the author whether they feel it's okay to use in your project.</p><p>Always check the license on anything you download and use.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec34"></a>Generated maps</h4></div></div></div><p>There are also many other resources out there to get maps for your game. Another method is to use an online map generation system. Now, to be fair, most are aimed at tabletop gamers and most are of a low quality, but there are a few gems to be found. For example, <a class="ulink" href="http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/" target="_blank">http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/</a> provides fairly high-resolution generated images and includes world features and places.</p><p>DonJon's site also offers a vast array of other generators to build maps and other RPG elements. There are even name and game dialog generators, so it really does meet most RPG needs.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl4sec9"></a>In-game generated maps</h5></div></div></div><p>Now, if you want more control over what the player sees or will have in their game, you can go all the way and start building maps and more through either Unity's asset pipeline or in code within the game.</p><p>External tools such as <span class="strong"><strong>Tiled</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mapeditor.org/</a>), which is shown in the following image, can be used to build and design maps. It has many interesting features and can even output several layers. You can use either top-down, 2D side scrolling, or even isometric maps.</p><p>A great Unity example of this is a project called <code class="literal">uTiled</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/vinull/utiled" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/vinull/utiled</a>), which provides a Unity asset that can read maps from Tiled.</p><p>Alternatively, you could use procedural techniques (see the <span class="emphasis"><em>Going procedural</em></span> section of this chapter) to build the map while the game is running by using the framework to knit individual segments of your map together. We will discuss this more later.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec84"></a>Going procedural</h3></div></div></div><p>If you are the bold or adventurous sort, another route to flesh out your world is to procedurally generate it. What you usually see when you look for procedural generation in Unity are dungeon generators. In fact, some of the best examples I've seen out there involve randomly generated dungeons where every run of the game is different from the last. Other examples are usually found in endless running games where a style of procedural selection is done to choose the next running area or to put random scene items in.</p><p>When we try to apply this to RPG games, we want to balance the fixed part of the world/story we are looking to convey with a more random placement of towns/villages or places of interest. This will make the world we see different for every player but still convey the background of the theme.</p><p>Now, the whole subject of procedural generation is far too large to go into for this book, but I can give you a few points for where to look.</p><p>The best place to start is the <span class="strong"><strong>Procedural Content Generation Wiki</strong></span> available at <a class="ulink" href="http://pcg.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">http://pcg.wikidot.com/</a>; it's the go-to place to start learning the following general techniques:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Iterated function systems</strong></span>: These are fractals to create land masses or structured areas.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>L-systems</strong></span>: These are used for road or path generation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Diamond-square and midpoint displacement algorithms</strong></span>: These are used to create random height terrain</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Perlin and simplex noise system</strong></span>s: These are used to add further randomness to the generation</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note78"></a>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A word to the wise</strong></span>
</p><p>Procedural generation is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of math involved and a lot of trial and error. However, if you can master small parts, you can achieve a truly wondrous game with lots of replayability.</p><p>Procedural generation is too large a subject for this book. Hopefully, I've given you a few tips and tidbits to get you going so you know what to look for should you want to venture down this road.</p></div></div></div>
