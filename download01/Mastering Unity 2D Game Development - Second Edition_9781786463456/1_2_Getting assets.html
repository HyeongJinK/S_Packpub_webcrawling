There are plenty of resources available to game developers, either as placement assets for the developer's use, whether they are full assets, or just a framework that you can tweak to get your desired result. There are a multitude of options.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note3"></a>Note</h3><p>In the code bundle of this book, you'll get all the assets you need to follow during the creation of the game. The site where it is available online will be listed with the instructions.</p></div><p>Some of the best sites to gather assets are described as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Art</strong></span>: Art, especially 2D art, is generally easy to find on a budget, particularly for the placeholder art, until you buy or create your own for the finished product (although I've seen many games created with some of these assets). Some good sites to start with are <a class="ulink" href="http://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">http://opengameart.org/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://open.commonly.cc/" target="_blank">http://open.commonly.cc/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>: Sound that works for your project is a lot trickier to get. Free sites are okay, but they generally don't have the right sound you will want or you will end up digging through hundreds or more sounds to get a close match. A good website to start with is <a class="ulink" href="http://soundbible.com/" target="_blank">http://soundbible.com/</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span>: Some sites just hold a general collection of assets instead of specializing in specific areas. The best site for this, as everything is almost guaranteed to be free, is <a class="ulink" href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">http://search.creativecommons.org/</a>. The Unity<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Store</strong></span> also offers a great deal of free assets from art to code. Some of these assets are available from users, and others are available from the Unity team themselves. Not all of the assets are free, but you can easily sort your search result by price. You can find the Unity Asset Store at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com" target="_blank">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div>
