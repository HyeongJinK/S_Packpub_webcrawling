Select <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> at the top of Unity's Home Screen. When creating a 2D game, you want to ensure that you start the project in <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span> mode by selecting the appropriate mode in the Unity's home screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_007.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Unity's home screen</p></div></div><p>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember, if you accidentally set the mode to 3D, you can change this at any time for your project through <span class="strong"><strong>Editor Settings</strong></span>, as discussed in the previous chapter.</p></div><p>After selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Create project</strong></span>, you'll be brought to the <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span> Window, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_008.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Unity's Editor window</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>It's important to note that when you create a new project in Unity, you are creating a new folder that can be accessed through File Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac OS X) with the following subfolders:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now that we have created our project, let's create the folder structure for the project, as shown in the following screenshot and discussed previously:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>To create a new folder from within Unity, simply select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Folder </strong></span>from the project tab in the bottom left corner of the screen:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_011.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>When creating folders from within Unity, they will be represented within the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder saved to your computer. Alternatively, if you create the folders from within Window's File Explorer (or Mac's Finder), the folders will appear within Unity. In the following screenshot, you will see how the folder structure is mirrored between Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> window and Window's File Explorer:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_02_012.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Unity's Project windows and Window's File Explorer</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, these folders created from within Unity are showing up in our project folder saved to our computers.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>At this point, it's important to note that we will most likely not use all of these folders during the course of this book. Nevertheless, it is a good working practice to get these folders set up for every project just so that you have a standard template.</p></div></div>
