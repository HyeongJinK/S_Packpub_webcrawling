<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch13lvl1sec92"></a>Building our start screen</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>As stated earlier, the start screen is the first screen the player will see and a lot of their opinion of your game will be derived from how good it looks. If you are not the artistic type and don't have an eye for layout, I highly recommend looking at the start screen of other games to get an idea of what to make it look like. Usually the start screen has its own unique game art.</p><p>We're going to make a very simple (and sadly, kind of ugly) start screen for now. You can adjust this later to make it more attractive and give it menus, but we are just going to have the title of the game, the town's background image, and a Play button.</p><p>Select <code class="literal">StartScreen</code> from the <code class="literal">Assets/Scenes</code> folder. Select <code class="literal">Create</code> | <code class="literal">UI</code> | <code class="literal">Image</code> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>. We want this background image to scale with the screen size, so select the Canvas and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas Scaler</strong></span> properties as the following shows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>We used 1024x768 as the reference resolution, because the background image we will use has that resolution.</p><p>Now select the <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> from the Hierarchy and change its anchor presets so that it stretches across the entire screen. Add the background image to the <span class="strong"><strong>Source Image</strong></span> slot of the <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> script. Do not select <span class="strong"><strong>Preserve Aspect</strong></span>. Oddly enough we are OK with this scaling if we have a different screen size; we just want it to always fill the screen. As shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now add text to the scene by right-clicking on the <code class="literal">Canvas</code> and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>text</strong></span>. Change the text to <span class="strong"><strong>Mastering Unity 2D</strong></span> and give it the following properties:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>To make it a little more attractive, give it a drop-shadow, by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add Component</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Effects</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Shadow</strong></span>. Change the properties as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, we just need a button that will navigate the player from this screen to the <code class="literal">Town</code> screen. Create a UI button on the screen, and center it. Change its text to display the word <span class="strong"><strong>Play</strong></span>.</p><p>Your scene should look as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, create a script called <code class="literal">LevelLoader</code> in the <code class="literal">Assets/Scripts</code> folder. This will be a simple script that will transition to the next scene when the Play button is pressed. Replace its code with the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine; &#13;
using System.Collections; &#13;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; &#13;
 &#13;
public class LevelLoader : MonoBehaviour { &#13;
 &#13;
    public string levelToLoad = "Town"; &#13;
     &#13;
 &#13;
    public void LoadTheLevel(){ &#13;
        SceneManager.LoadScene(levelToLoad); &#13;
    } &#13;
     &#13;
}  &#13;
</pre><p>Attach this script to the button and have the button run the <code class="literal">LoadTheLevel</code> function when it is clicked, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_13_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Return to the <code class="literal">SplashScreen</code>, and play the game. You now will be taken to the <code class="literal">StartScreen</code> after 3 seconds and can enter the town upon hitting the lay button.</p></div>
