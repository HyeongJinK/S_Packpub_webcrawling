You can go as simple as adding a Facebook <span class="strong"><strong>like</strong></span> button or Twitter <span class="strong"><strong>share</strong></span> button. Or you can get more complicated and integrate Facebook friends lists to allow for multiplayer gameplay, for players to give each other items, or for players to compete through leader boards. Even something as simple as allowing players to share their high score is valuable.</p><p>Including incentives for using social networking options is a good way to raise awareness for your game. Often, games will offer bonuses for pointing others to a game, or offer additional bonuses for playing with others by way of social media.</p><p>Some games take it a step further. The 2015 game <code class="literal">#IDARB</code> actually allowed players to tweet specific hashtags at games being publicly streamed online in order to make things happen that both hindered and helped those playing. The 2011 mobile game, <span class="strong"><strong>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</strong></span> allowed players to tweet out specific lines of dialog from the game without clearly identifying the source of the text, which helped to build an air of mystery around the game.</p><p>You can find many different assets on the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> to assist you in adding social network integration into your game.</p></div>
