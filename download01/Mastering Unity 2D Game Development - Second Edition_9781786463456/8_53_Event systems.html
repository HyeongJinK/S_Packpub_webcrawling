<span class="strong"><strong>Fixed systems</strong></span>: This is where the places and interactions are actually planned in advance by forcing the player to be drawn in to an event at prescribed times/places</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Random generation</strong></span>: This involves using random systems to challenge the player within a given time frame or occurrence, giving the player a chance of an event but not a certainty of one</p></li></ul></div><p>There are merits and demerits with either approach for the player as they interact with your game. Fixed systems are easy to implement but limit replayability (game becomes dull in the second or subsequent runs), whereas random systems can be trickier to get the balance right but also means the player will likely keep playing longer or get irritated very quickly.</p><p>Finding the balance between implementing events is a tricky process, as you will have to find the right sweet spot for in your particular game, and inevitably all games implement this differently.</p><p>Also, remember that there is no silver bullet and no reason not to use both systems togetherâ€”using fixed systems to tell a story and random events to keep it interesting.</p></div>
