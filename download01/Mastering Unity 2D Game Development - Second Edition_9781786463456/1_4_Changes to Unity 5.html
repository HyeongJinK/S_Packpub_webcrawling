Here you will find a general overview of the most relevant changes to 2D game development, other than the ones already discussed concerning 2D physics.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"></a>Note</h3><p>The following list does not include all of the new features included in Unity 5 and the Unity 5.3 update. For a complete list, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.0" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.0</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/08/unity-5-3-all-new-features-and-more-platforms/" target="_blank">http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/08/unity-5-3-all-new-features-and-more-platforms/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"></a>Licensing</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's start with the best new feature of Unity 5. In previous versions of Unity, certain features were only available in the Pro version and were blocked in the free version. However, in Unity 5, all features are unlocked and can be enjoyed even by developers using the free version, now named <span class="strong"><strong>Unity Personal</strong></span>. If a game you create with Unity Personal makes $100k or more, you will have to pay for the professional version.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"></a>Component access</h3></div></div></div><p>Another big change to Unity 5 is the removal of quick property accessors within code. This means that a lot of your code written for Unity 4 will need to be rewritten. For example, the use of <code class="literal">.rigidBody2D</code> and <code class="literal">.collider2D</code> are no longer permissible. However, if you have code in your game from an older version of Unity, you will be shown the following warning:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_013.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Selecting <span class="strong"><strong>I Made a Backup. Go Ahead!</strong></span> will automatically convert all quick property accessors to code containing the <code class="literal">GetComponent</code> function. For example, take the following code that was previously written as:</p><pre class="programlisting">object.ridgidBody2D.isKinematic=false; &#13;
</pre><p>Now the preceding code would now be written as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">object.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;().isKinematic=false; &#13;
</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note9"></a>Note</h3><p>Make sure you back up your code before selecting, <span class="strong"><strong>I Made a Backup. Go Ahead! </strong></span>The automatic changes may not be what you expect.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"></a>Animator changes</h3></div></div></div><p>The most glaring difference when you initially start up the Unity 5 Animator will be the inclusion of an <span class="strong"><strong>Entry</strong></span> node. Unity 5 has now added <span class="strong"><strong>Entry</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Exist</strong></span> nodes to <span class="strong"><strong>StateMachines (we will discuss state machines in </strong></span>
<a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Encountering Enemies and Running Away</em></span>). These nodes allow the transition between states machines. For the most part, you animations that were running in Unity 4 should run appropriately in Unity 5, but will include the new <span class="strong"><strong>Entry</strong></span> node, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

Unity 5 provide an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio Mixer</strong></span> asset type that now allows you to adjust all of your audio levels more efficiently, as show in the following screenshot:</p><p>
