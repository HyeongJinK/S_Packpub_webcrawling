<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch01lvl1sec9"></a>Unity's 2D features</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In 2013, with the release of Unity 4.3, Unity made 2D game development significantly simpler by adding native support for 2D development to the Unity editor environment. Since then, 2D game development has been on the rise among the indie and hobbyist developers. This section will give a general overview the various 2D features and terms as they appear in Unity 5.3.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec8"></a>2D mode versus 3D mode</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating a new Unity project, you can choose between 3D mode and 2D mode, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The main differences in the two modes are the way assets will be imported into your project and the default camera view and position. If you select 2D, the default camera will be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Orthographic</strong></span> projection, the camera's position will be set to (0, 0, -10), your scene will be in 2D view, and your and images will be imported as sprites rather than textures.</p><p>You can easily swap between the two modes at any time during development by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span> and changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Behavior Mode</strong></span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Behavior Mode</strong></span> will not affect how your game runs. This setting really only makes the process of importing new assets and creating new cameras quicker, because you will not have to manually change the texture type of images and change the projection of camera.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note4"></a>Note</h3><p>There are a few other items that are handled differently in 2D mode versus 3D mode, such as lighting, and you can find a list of all the differences at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2DAnd3DModeSettings.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2DAnd3DModeSettings.html</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec9"></a>Working with sprites</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span> are 2D images. Sprites can be images that depict a single object (for example, a character) or an entire scene (for example, a background). Several sprites can also be combined to create a single object, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_007.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A character created by combining multiple sprites; example from Unity's platformer sample</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>When your project is set to 2D mode, any image you import in to your project folder will automatically be assigned a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> texture type. This means that the image is assumed to represent a 2D object or scene rather than an image that will applied to a 3D object.</p><p>When a sprite image is dragged from the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder to the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view, a <span class="strong"><strong>2D Object-Sprite</strong></span> will be added to your scene. This object will automatically be given the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component (refer to the following section), making the sprite visible in your game; no additional lighting or work is required.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note5"></a>Note</h3><p>It's important to note that if your sprite has transparencies, you want to import your sprite texture as a <code class="literal">.png</code> formatted image file.</p></div><p>By default, each image is imported as a single sprite; however, by using the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> (refer to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Sprite Editor</em></span> section), you can change this in various ways.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note6"></a>Note</h3><p>While your sprite textures can be any dimension, it is highly recommended that the texture be a perfect square with a power of two pixel height and width (that is 64 px by 64 px, 128 px by 128 px, and so on).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec0"></a>Sprite Renderer</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> is the component that allows a 2D object to be displayed as a Sprite on the screen. Refer to the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> property selects the image that will be displayed. Any image that is assigned a <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span> texture type can be placed in this property. The <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> property allows you to change the vertex color of the rendered image as well as the transparency (through the alpha).</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Flip</strong></span> is a property new to Unity 5.0. This will allow you to flip the sprite in the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> planes without having to use <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> properties in the transform, as was necessary in previous versions of Unity.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> component automatically sets the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> property of the object to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites-Default</strong></span>, which uses the default <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> property as <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite/Default</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites/Default</strong></span> shader does not interact with lights in the scene, so lights are not required to view Sprites with these default settings.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec1"></a>Sprite Editor</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> allows you to manipulate a sprite once it has been imported in to Unity. The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> is only available for graphics with <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> set to <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite (2D and UI)</strong></span>. The following is the screenshot of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> window showing a single sprite:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The editor allows some basic manipulations to happen to a sprite, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Changing the sprite's pixilation (mipmap)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Altering the sprite's pivot position</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Splicing the texture to identify the sprite region (this is also used for sprite sheets; refer to the next section)</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec2"></a>Sprite sheets</h4></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Sprite sheets</strong></span> are a core part of any 2D animation system. Sprite sheets are a single texture that contains multiple images that represent individual frames of a 2D animation. Unifying all textures into a single larger texture means greater performance when sending the sprites to the graphic cards, which is a lot faster than sending lots of smaller files. Refer to the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_010.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Sprite Editor window showing multiple sprites in a grid</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>The traditional way of forming sprite sheets is to put sprites into specific regions on a single image and then identify the box regions where the individual sprites lie. These regions form individual frames in the sprite animation. As you can see in the preceding screenshot, nine sprites are arranged in three rows to form a character's walking animation. The sprites could have also been arranged in a single row or a single column; it doesn't matter. It's just how the artist best packs the sprite sheet for the animation. Unity can handle just about any arrangement you wish to throw at it. Just set the width and height of each texture region and the Unity <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span> will do the rest. If your individual sprites are non-disjoint images, all of the same size, Unity can also automatically slice the texture in to the appropriate regions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec3"></a>Texture atlases</h4></div></div></div><p>Akin to sprite sheets, texture atlases are a more efficient way of packing textures into a single texture. It can contain various parts of a character (as follows), or a set of weapons, or a set of buttons to be used in your UI—anything really.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_011.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>A selection of separate textures that have been automatically packed; example from Unity's platformer sample
</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>Unity has added a very clever texture cutting and edge detection to make this work very well and identify specific regions on the texture for each sprite. You can also change the selection areas if Unity is too optimistic when selecting the texture regions.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span> utility provided by Unity can combine all of your sprite textures in to a single tightly packed atlas to help improve the performance of your game.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec4"></a>Physics 2D</h4></div></div></div><p>The inclusion of a 2D physics system in Unity 4.3 has made 2D game creation easier than ever. Before the inclusion, these physics had to be either programmed by the developer or faked using 3D physics. However, now, with the use of the <span class="strong"><strong>RidgidBody2D </strong></span>component, the various 2D colliders, physics materials, effectors, and joints, making a 2D game with physics can be achieved with a few simple clicks.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note7"></a>Note</h3><p>Physics plays an important role in many 2D games. This is particularly true for platformers and certain puzzle games such as Tsum Tsum, Angry Birds, and Cut the Rope.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>RigidBody2D</strong></span> component can be added to any object that you want to be affected by the physics engine. For example, you can add the <span class="strong"><strong>RigidBody 2D</strong></span> component to a sprite you want affected by gravity. The various 2D colliders, such as the <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Polygon Collider 2D</strong></span>, can be added to any object that you want to check collision on. This can be used to keep objects from passing through one another (refer to the following screenshot) or can be used to check when two objects touch each other.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786463456/graphics/image_01_012.jpg" /><div class="caption"><p>Example of 2D colliders used in the Unity platformer to surround walkable elements</p></div></div><p>
</p><p>You can also apply physics materials to your 2D objects using <span class="strong"><strong>Physics Material 2D</strong></span>. This allows greater control over an object's physics interactions, such as friction and bounciness.</p><p>An effector is essentially a component that applies a type of force to sprites that interact with the 2D object that has an effector component attached to it. Unity 5 added four effector components to the Physics 2D library: <span class="strong"><strong>Area Effector 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Point Effector 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Platform Effector 2D</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Surface Effector 2D</strong></span>. When Unity 5.3 released, the <span class="strong"><strong>Buoyancy Effector 2D</strong></span> component was added. <span class="strong"><strong>Constant Force 2D</strong></span> was also included in the Unity 5 update, which allows you to apply a constant force to a sprite.</p><p>Joints are also included in the Unity Physics 2D package. Joints allow various 2D game objects to join together in distinct ways. Four new joints were added with Unity 5.3. There are nine joints now included in Unity: <span class="strong"><strong>Distance Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Fixed Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Friction Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hinge Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Relative Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Slider Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Spring Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Target Joint 2D</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Wheel Joint 2D</strong></span>.</p></div></div></div>
