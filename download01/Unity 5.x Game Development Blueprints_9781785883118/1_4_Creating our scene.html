Once inside, right-click within the <code class="literal">Sprites</code> folder and select <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> to select the <code class="literal">playerShip.png</code> file from the <code class="literal">Chapter 1/Art Assets</code> folder from our example code to bring it in. Once added, confirm that the image's texture type is <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite</strong></span> by clicking on it and from the Inspector tab, confirm that the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> property is <code class="literal">Sprite (2D and UI)</code>. If it isn't, simply change it to that, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"></a>Note</h3><p>If you do not want to drag and drop the files, you can also right-click within the <code class="literal">Sprites</code> folder in <span class="strong"><strong>Project Browser</strong></span> (bottom-left corner) and select <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> to select a file from the <code class="literal">Chapter 1/Art Assets</code> folder to bring it in.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_01_05.jpg" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"></a>Note</h3><p>The art assets used for this tutorial were provided by Kenney. To see more of their work, please check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kenney.nl" target="_blank">www.kenney.nl</a>.</p></div></li><li><p>Next, drag<a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a> and drop the ship into the scene (the center part that's currently dark gray). Once completed, set the position of the sprite to the center of the screen (0, 0) by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Position</strong></span>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_01_06.jpg" /></div><p>Now, with <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>the player in the world, let's add in a background. However, instead of creating a huge image or copying and pasting a similar image over and over, we will learn how we can use a material with a repeating texture.</p></li><li><p>From the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, bring the background sprite into the project and then select it and change the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>tab to <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Now, let's create a 3D cube by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Game Object</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> from the top toolbar. Change the object's name from <span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Background</code>. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component, change <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>) and the scale to (<code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">1</code>).</p><p>Since our camera is at 0, 0, -10 and the player is at 0, 0, 0, putting the object at position 0, 0, 1 will put it behind all of our sprites. By creating a 3D object and scaling it, we are making it really large, much larger than the player's monitor. If we scaled a sprite, it would be one really large image with pixilation, which would look really bad. By using a 3D object, the texture that is applied to the faces of the 3D object is repeated, and since the image is tileable, it looks like one big continuous image.</p></li><li><p>As we won't be using it (and we're a 2D game), remove the BoxCollider component by right clicking on it from the Inspector tab and then selecting Remove Component.</p></li><li><p>Next, we will need to create a material for our background to use. To do so, under<a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>, and name the material <code class="literal">BackgroundMaterial</code>. We can create a new folder called <code class="literal">Materials</code> to store this, but since this project will only use one it is OK to stay in <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span>. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Shader</strong></span> property, click on the drop-down menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Unlit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span>. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> box on the right-hand side and select the background texture. Once completed, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Tiling</strong></span> property's<span class="strong"><strong> x</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> to <code class="literal">25</code>. Have a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"></a>Note</h3><p>In addition to just selecting from the menu, you can also drag and drop the background texture directly onto the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span> box and it will set the property.</p><p>Tiling tells Unity how many times the image should repeat in the <span class="strong"><strong>x</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>y</strong></span> positions, respectively.</p></div></li><li><p>Finally, go back to the Background object in Hierarchy. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component, open up <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> by left-clicking on the arrow, and change <span class="strong"><strong>Element 0</strong></span> to our <span class="strong"><strong>BackgroundMaterial</strong></span> material. Consider the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_01_08.jpg" /></div><p>You can also add a material to an object by dragging and dropping the material onto the object in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene </strong></span>tab.</p><p>Well, at this point we have a color, but we don't have the stars from our image repeating.. This is due to how the <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wrap Mode</strong></span> property is set. In Unity 5.2, the default mode is <code class="literal">Clamp</code>, which means that the edges of the image will be extended out rather than repeat. Let's fix that now.</p></li><li><p>From<a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>Project </strong></span>tab, select the <code class="literal">background</code> texture object. Once selected, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>tab, change the <span class="strong"><strong>Wrap Mode</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Repeat</strong></span>, and then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span>. Finally, select the <code class="literal">Cube </code>object from <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and then in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector </strong></span>tab at the top, rename the object to <code class="literal">Background</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_01_09.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>Now, when<a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a> we play the game, you'll see that we now have a complete background that tiles properly.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"></a>Scripting 101</h3></div></div></div><p>In <a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a>Unity, the behavior of game objects is controlled by the different components that are attached to them in a form of association called composition. These components are things that we can add and remove at any time to create much more complex objects. If you want to do anything that isn't already provided by Unity, you'll have to write it on your own through a process we call <span class="strong"><strong>scripting</strong></span>. Scripting<a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a> is an essential element in all but the simplest of video games.</p><p>Unity allows you to code in either C#, Boo, or UnityScript, a language designed specifically for use with Unity and modeled after JavaScript. For this book, we will use C#.</p><p>C# is an object-oriented programming language â€“ an industry-standard language similar to Java or C++. The majority of plugins from Asset Store are written in C#, and code written in C# can port to other platforms, such as mobile, with very minimal code changes. C# is also a strongly typed language, which means that if there is any issue with the code, it will be identified within Unity and will stop you from running the game until it's fixed. This may seem like a hindrance, but when working with code, I very much prefer to write correct code and solve problems before they escalate to something much worse.</p></div></div>
