You could use the Unity Editor to place things by hand, but as you may have seen earlier, it takes a really long time. It's also possible for us to create an array as we did earlier in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Side-Scrolling Platformer</em></span>, but in that case, your levels need to be defined in a script and you'll need to either use an external tool or type in numbers individually for it to work correctly.</p><p>Another option is to save and load level files inside the game, and that way you can playtest your levels and make changes on the fly and save them when you're ready. We also have the advantage of being able to see exactly what the level looks like when you're making it.</p></div>
