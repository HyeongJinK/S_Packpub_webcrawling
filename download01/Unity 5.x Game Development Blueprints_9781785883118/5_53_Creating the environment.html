I have provided the completed level (<code class="literal">StartingMap</code>) for those who want to get started and you can skip to the next section, but for those who wish to know how to assemble the map, you'll need to do the following:</p></li><li><p>To start this off, bring the <code class="literal">bg_blue</code> sprite into the<span class="strong"><strong> Scene </strong></span>tab and duplicate (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>) four of<a id="id255" class="indexterm"></a> them placing them horizontally away from each other while creating a <code class="literal">Background</code> sorting layer and assigning them to it. Then, create an empty game object named <code class="literal">Background </code>and place all of those objects inside of it.</p></li><li><p>Afterwards, create another layer using the two grass textures one after the other, then duplicate and drag it until the area created by the background is filled out. Create an empty game object to hold them all named <span class="strong"><strong>Grass Layer</strong></span>. Feel free to place some trees up at the top to make it a bit more interesting.</p></li><li><p>Next, do the same thing as the grass with the water texture provided creating a parent object named <span class="strong"><strong>Water Row 1</strong></span>. We want to make sure that this object is on top of the grass so change the <code class="literal">Z</code> value to <code class="literal">-1</code>.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate the water layer twice by changing the <code class="literal">Z</code> values to <code class="literal">-2</code> and <code class="literal">-3</code>, respectively, naming them <span class="strong"><strong>Water Row 2</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Water Row 3</strong></span>.</p></li><li><p>Finally, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object and zoom the camera in to have a <span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span> of <code class="literal">3.9</code>. Once you're finished, you should have something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_05_01.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div></div>
