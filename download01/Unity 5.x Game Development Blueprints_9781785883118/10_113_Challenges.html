Here are some ideas to get your mind thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In the same way that we can only create one <code class="literal">PlayerStart</code>, change it so that we can only place one goal! In that same line of thinking, have the player start to be invisible when we are playing the game!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In our first-person "shooter" game, save the player's <span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span> so that whenever you quit and resume the game, you start off where you were!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Now that we have the new level editor working, change the system so that we start the game loading a level from a file instead of from the provided array!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>You may notice that at some places, collectibles are placed on top of one another. Now, this doesn't really hurt levels loaded, as when you save the level, it will only place one of them. However, should you want to fix this, you can just change the collider from a sphere collider to a box collider, as in the corners, it's not detecting that it's colliding.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>There are other additional ways to save files, such as using XML.
