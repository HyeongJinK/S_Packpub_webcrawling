You've actually been using a GUI in<a id="id94" class="indexterm"></a> the previous chapter and also to interact with the operating system of your choice. You wouldn't be able to make your electronics do anything without the use of a GUI such as a command prompt similar to DOS and UNIX.</p><p>When working on GUIs, we want them to be as intuitive as possible and only contain the information that is pertinent to the player at any given time. There are people whose main job is programming and/or designing user interfaces and they have college degrees on the subject. So, although we won't talk about everything that we have to work with on GUIs, I do want to touch on the aspects that should be quite helpful when working on your own projects in the future.</p></div>
