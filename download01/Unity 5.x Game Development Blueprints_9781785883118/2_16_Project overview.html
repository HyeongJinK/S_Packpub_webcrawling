It is important to note that unlike the previous edition of this book, in this second edition of the book we will be creating these menus using the new UI system that was introduced in Unity 4.6.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"></a>Your objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>This project will be split into a <a id="id96" class="indexterm"></a>number of tasks.
