Now, perform the following step:</p><p>With Unity started, open the project from the previous chapter and if you are on our previous level, create a new scene by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New Scene</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec48"></a>Creating architecture overview</h3></div></div></div><p>As a level <a id="id469" class="indexterm"></a>designer, one <a id="id470" class="indexterm"></a>of the most time-consuming parts of your job will be creating environments. There are many different ways out there to create levels. By default, Unity gives us some default meshes, such as a <span class="strong"><strong>Box</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Sphere</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span>, and while it's technically possible to build a level in that way, it could get really tedious really quickly. Next, I'm going to quickly go through the most popular options to build levels for games made in Unity before we jump into building a level of our own.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec06"></a>3D modelling software</h4></div></div></div><p>A lot <a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a>of times, opening a 3D modeling software package and building architecture that way is what professional games studios will often do. This gives you maximum freedom in creating your environment and allows you to do exactly what you'd like to do. However, this requires you to be proficient in that tool, whether that be Maya, 3Ds Max, Blender (which can be downloaded for <a id="id472" class="indexterm"></a>free at <a class="ulink" href="http://blender.org" target="_blank">blender.org</a>), or some other tool. Then, you just need to export your models and import them into Unity.</p><p>Unity supports a lot of different formats for 3D models, but there are a lot of issues to consider. For some best practices, when it comes to creating art assets, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/" target="_blank">http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/09/02/art-assets-best-practice-guide/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec07"></a>Constructing geometry with brushes</h4></div></div></div><p>Using <a id="id473" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Constructive Solid Geometry</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSG</strong></span>), commonly referred to as brushes, has been a long-existing<a id="id474" class="indexterm"></a> way for games to have in-game level editors, which has led to people creating levels for them. Tools such as Unreal Engine 4, Hammer, Radiant, and other professional game engines make use of this building structure, making it quite easy for people to create and iterate through levels quickly through a process named <a id="id475" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>whiteboxing</strong></span>, as it's very easy to make changes to simple shapes. However, just like learning a modeling software tool, there can be a higher barrier to entry in using brushes to create your geometry, but for creating those certain types of games where you need to create a lot of different content, it can be a great tool.</p><p>Unity does not support building things like this by default, but there are several tools in the <a id="id476" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Unity Asset Store</strong></span> that allow you to do something like this. For example, <span class="strong"><strong>sixbyseven studio</strong></span> <a id="id477" class="indexterm"></a>has an extension named ProBuilder, which can add the ability to create world geometry using brushes within Unity, making it very easy to build levels (it's what I use normally when building environments for 3D games in Unity and I use it in one of my other titles, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building an FPS Game with Unity</em></span>, also available from Packt Publishing). However, as an extension, you'll need to buy it either from the developer or through the Asset Store, as it is not free. You can find out <a id="id478" class="indexterm"></a>more information about ProBuilder and the free version of their tool at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/" target="_blank">http://www.protoolsforunity3d.com/probuilder/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec08"></a>Modular tilesets</h4></div></div></div><p>Another way to generate architecture is through the use of tiles that are created by an artist. You can <a id="id479" class="indexterm"></a>use them to build your level. Similar to using LEGO pieces, we can use these tiles to snap together walls and other objects to create a building. With creative uses of tiles, you can create a large amount of content with just a minimal amount of assets. This is probably the easiest way to create a level at the expense of not being able to create unique-looking buildings since you only <a id="id480" class="indexterm"></a>have a few pieces to work with.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec01"></a>Mix and match</h5></div></div></div><p>Of course, it's also <a id="id481" class="indexterm"></a>possible to use a mixture of the tools mentioned to get the advantages of certain ways of doing things. For example, you could use brushes to block out an area (which is why it is named <a id="id482" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>greyboxing</strong></span>) and then use a group of tiles named a
<a id="id483" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>tileset</strong></span> to replace boxes with highly detailed models, which is what a lot of AAA studios do, using the boxes just for their collision. In addition, we could also place tiles initially and then add in props to break up the repetitiveness of levels, which is what we are going to do.</p></div></div></div></div>
