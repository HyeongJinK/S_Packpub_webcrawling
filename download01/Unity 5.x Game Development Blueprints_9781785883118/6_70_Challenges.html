Here are some ideas to get your mind thinking:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add in sounds and music to the game and customize the GUI in the ways we talked about earlier!</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Create levels of <a id="id376" class="indexterm"></a>your own! Danny Calleri has created a really nice level editor called Toast Editor that you can run from your web browser to design levels graphically. To use it, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://dannycalleri.github.io/toasteditor/index.html" target="_blank">http://dannycalleri.github.io/toasteditor/index.html</a>. When exporting, use the C++ option and replace the top line with our levels line and add <code class="literal">new int []</code> to the beginning of every line in the array.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Going one step further, instead of creating arrays for the levels, it is possible to load in text files in Unity, so you can load the levels from a file.  For more information on<a id="id377" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>Text Assets</strong></span>, see <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html" target="_blank">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextAsset.html</a>.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>As it stands when the player hits one of the orbs, they can jump again, if you'd prefer to not have this happen, adding an additional parameter to the <code class="literal">Raycast</code> function with the <span class="strong"><strong>Tag</strong></span> of the object would solve the issue.</p></li></ul></div></div>
