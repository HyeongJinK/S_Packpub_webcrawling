<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch11lvl1sec112"></a>Setting up the build settings</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>There are many<a id="id696" class="indexterm"></a> times during development that you may want to see what your game looks like if you build it outside of the editor. It can give you a sense of accomplishment; I know, I felt that way the first time I pushed a build to a console devkit. Whether it's for PC, Mac, Linux, web player, mobile, or console, we all have to go through the same menu, the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu. We perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>We are going to first open our <code class="literal">Twinstick Shooter</code> project that we created back in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>2D Twin-Stick Shooter</em></span>, <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating GUIs</em></span>. Open up your main menu scene (in the example code, it is saved as <code class="literal">Main_Menu</code>). Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_01.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>To access our <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> menu, we will need to navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> from the top menu (or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>). Take a look at the following<a id="id697" class="indexterm"></a> screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_02.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>If you have been following thoroughly from <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating GUIs</em></span>, you should see two icons in the <span class="strong"><strong>Scenes In Build</strong></span> section. If you have not, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Open Scenes</strong></span> button for each level.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note84"></a>Note</h3><p>Another way to add levels to your build is to just drag and drop them from the project browser. It's also important to note that you can also drag them around to order them however you want. The level that is at index <code class="literal">0</code> will be the one that the game starts with.</p></div></li><li><p>Once you're ready, select a platform from the bottom-left corner menu. The Unity logo shows which one you're currently compiling for. We're going to compile for Windows now, so if it is currently not set to <span class="strong"><strong>PC, Mac, and Linux Standalone</strong></span>, select that, and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button if needed.</p></li><li><p>Once you have <a id="id698" class="indexterm"></a>all this set up, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Build</strong></span> button. Once this is done, it will ask you for a name and a location to put the game in. I'm going to name it <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter</code> and put it in an <code class="literal">Export</code> folder located in the same directory as the <code class="literal">Assets</code> and <code class="literal">Library</code> folder. Afterward, hit <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_03.jpg" /></div></li><li><p>You may need to wait a bit, but as soon as it finishes, it will open up the folder with your new game. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_04.jpg" /></div></li></ol></div><p>When building for Windows, you should get something like the preceding screenshot. We have the executable, but we also have a data folder that contains all the assets for our application (right now called <code class="literal">TwinstickShooter_Data</code>). You must include the data folder with your game, or it will not run. This is a slight pain, but later on in this chapter, we <a id="id699" class="indexterm"></a>will create an installer so that we can put it on a computer without any hassle.</p><p>If you build for Mac, it will bundle the app and data all together, so once you export it, all you need to give people is the application.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note85"></a>Note</h3><p>If you are interested in submitting your Mac game to the Mac App Store, there<a id="id700" class="indexterm"></a> is a nice tutorial about doing just that at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html" target="_blank">http://www.conlanrios.com/2013/12/signing-unity-game-for-mac-app-store.html</a>.</p></div><p>If you <span class="emphasis"><em>double-click</em></span> on the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file to run the game, you'll be brought to the following startup menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_05.jpg" /></div><p>This will allow players to customize their <span class="strong"><strong>Screen Resolution</strong></span> values as well as other options, such as what buttons to use for input. I personally feel that this menu makes projects look more unprofessional, so I'll be teaching you how to remove this as well.</p><p>Anyway, once we click<a id="id701" class="indexterm"></a> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play!</strong></span> button, we'll be taken to the proper game screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_11_06.jpg" /></div><p>And it's working great. We can work at any resolution that we choose, and all the menus are functioning as well!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note86"></a>Note</h3><p>For more information on publishing and specific things to look out for, check out the following link:<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html" target="_blank"> http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html</a>
