However, not all things are constructed like that. Man-made structures, such as office buildings, stone pillars, and floor tiles, are all made up of pieces that look similar to one another. Rather than modeling out every single wall in your building, can't you use one you made before?</p><p>As you might <a id="id463" class="indexterm"></a>remember in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Side-scrolling Platformer</em></span>, you learned how we can use tiles to build a level using only a couple of different objects, duplicating them as needed to create our environment. In this chapter, we will use the same line of thinking in a 3D environment using a method named modular level design.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Modular level design</strong></span> is a<a id="id464" class="indexterm"></a> tool that <span class="strong"><strong>AAA</strong></span> (pronounced triple A) developers (those working with the highest development budgets and promotion) have been using to create great-looking levels in the minimum amount of time possible. Breaking apart buildings into modules creates building blocks that can be placed next to one another, such as LEGO pieces, to create an entire structure. This makes it much easier to create levels than just trying to model everything from scratch and is a staple of large open-world games such as Bethesda's <span class="emphasis"><em>Fallout 4</em></span>.</p></div>
