This ship can move around the screen using the keyboard and shoot projectiles in the direction that the mouse is pointing. Enemies and obstacles will spawn toward the player, and the player will avoid/shoot them. This chapter will also serve as a refresher for a lot of the concepts of working in Unity and give an overview of the native 2D tools in Unity.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"></a>Your objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>This project <a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a>will be split into a number of tasks. It will be a simple step-by-step process from beginning to end. Here is the outline of our tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Setting up the project</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating our scene</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding player movement</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding shooting functionality</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating enemies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding GameController to spawn enemy waves</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Particle systems</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding audio</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding points, score, and wave numbers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Publishing<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> the game</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"></a>Prerequisites</h3></div></div></div><p>Before <a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a>we start, we will need to get the latest Unity version, which you can always get by going to <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/unity/download/</a> and downloading it there:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781785883118/graphics/B05212_01_01.jpg" /></div><p>From here, you'll want to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Choose your Unity + Download</strong></span> button and from the following menu select the edition of Unity you'd like to use and then download the Launcher.</p><p>Everything that we will be covering will work in the Personal Edition, unless I mention specifically otherwise. At the time of writing, the latest version is 5.3.4, but the project should work with minimal changes in future versions.</p><p>We will <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>also need some graphical assets for use in our project. These can be downloaded from the example code provided for this book on Packt Publishing's website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.PacktPub.com" target="_blank">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>).</p><p>Navigate to the preceding URL, download the <code class="literal">Chapter1.zip</code> package, and unzip it. Inside the <code class="literal">Chapter1</code> folder, there are a number of things, including an <code class="literal">Art Assets</code> folder, which will have the art, sound, and font files you'll need for the project as well as the Twinstick Shooter folder which contains the finished project for you to take a look at.</p></div></div>
