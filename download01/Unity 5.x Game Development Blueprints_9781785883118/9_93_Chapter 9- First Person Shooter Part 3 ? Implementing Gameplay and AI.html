Now, to some people, the <a id="id566" class="indexterm"></a>card game <span class="emphasis"><em>War</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)</a>) is a game; however, the game is already determined before anyone actually plays the game because players have absolutely no interactions besides flipping cards.</p><p>Renowned game programmer and designer Sid Meier says that a game is "a series of interesting choices," and I really like that definition. At my alma mater and current employer DigiPen, we were taught that a video game was a real-time interactive simulation.</p><p>Having an environment is an excellent first step towards creating your game project, but this is a real-time simulation though it's not very interactive.</p></div>
