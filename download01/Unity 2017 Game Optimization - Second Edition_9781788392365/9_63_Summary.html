Hopefully, you have enjoyed the ride. To reiterate, perhaps, the most important tip in this book, always make sure that you verify the source of the performance bottleneck via benchmarking before making a single change. The last thing we want to waste time on is chasing ghosts in the codebase, when 5 minutes of profiler testing can save us an entire day of work. In a lot of cases, the solution requires a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether we're not sacrificing too much in any other area at the risk of adding further bottlenecks. Make sure that you have a reasonable understanding of the root cause of the bottleneck to avoid putting other performance metrics at risk. To also reiterate the second most important tip in this book, always profile and test after making changes to ensure that it had the intended effect.</p><p>Performance enhancement is all about problem solving, which can be a lot of fun since due to the complexity of modern computer hardware, small tweaks can yield big rewards. There are many techniques that can be implemented to improve application performance or speed up our workflows. Some of these are hard to fully realize without the experience and skills necessary to spend a reasonable amount of time implementing them. In most cases, the fixes are relatively simple if we simply take the time to find and understand the source of the problem. So, go forth and use your repository of knowledge to make your games the best they can be.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
