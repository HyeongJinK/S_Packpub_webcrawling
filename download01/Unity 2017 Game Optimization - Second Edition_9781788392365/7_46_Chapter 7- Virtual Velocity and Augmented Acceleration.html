For the sake of brevity, these two terms are often combined into the singular term <span class="strong"><strong>XR</strong></span>. There is also the <span class="strong"><strong>Mixed Reality</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MR</strong></span>) (also known as <span class="strong"><strong>Hybrid Reality</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>HR</strong></span>), where an application mixes the real and virtual worlds together, which encompasses all of previously mentioned formats, while also including <span class="strong"><strong>Augmented Virtuality</strong></span> where real world objects are scanned and superimposed inside a mostly virtual world. </p><p>The markets for these media formats have sprung up very fast and are continuing to grow rapidly, with huge investments from the technology industry's biggest players. Naturally, Game Engines such as Unity jumped on the bandwagon quickly, providing ample support for most of the top contending platforms, such as Google's Cardboard, HTC's Vive, Oculus' Rift, Microsoft's HoloLens and Samsung's GearVR platforms, as well as the more recent entries such as Apple's ARKit, Google's AR Core, Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality platform, PTC's (originally Qualcomm's) Vuforia, and Sony's PlayStation VR.</p><p>XR offers a whole new realm for developers and creatives to explore. This includes entertainment products such as games and 360-degree Videos (or <span class="emphasis"><em>360 Video</em></span> for short), where a series of cameras are bundled together, each facing a different direction--the various captures from those cameras are stitched together and later played back as a movie in a VR headset with visibility in all directions. Creative industry tools are also common in XR, such as 3D modeling software, workflow visualizations, and quality-of-life gadgets. There are very few rules that have been set in stone, so there are plenty of opportunities to innovate, contribute to this new wave of technology and become the one to create those rules. This has led to a lot of buzz and excitement as people explore what is possible and try to make their mark on the future of entertainment and interactive experiences.</p><p>Of course, almost every new and budding technology goes through the Hype Cycle (from the Gartner Hype Cycle available at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp" target="_blank">https://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp</a>). The Hype Cycle starts with its honeymoon period of excessive hype, and where early adopters will evangelize its benefits. Later, there is an eventual cooling of emotions as it enters the <span class="emphasis"><em>trough of</em></span><span class="emphasis"><em>disillusionment</em></span> since it hasn't quite hit the mainstream, and its benefits are not taking hold just yet<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span> This continues until it either the technology fails to capture hearts and minds, thus falling out of existence, or takes a firm hold and continues steady adoption. The following image shows the essentials of the Gartner Hype Cycle:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788392365/graphics/d76101a3-3284-4b1e-9bb4-f5dd5c40bff2.png" /></div><p>Arguably, XR has recently been passing through this final phase and is starting to enjoy much better support and much higher quality experiences than it did during the early days, although it is true that the adoption rate of XR has been slower than initially predicted. It remains to be seen whether XR will grow into a multi-billion dollar industry or fade into a niche market of gadgets. Consequently, developing within this new medium is not without its risks, and we can find industry analysts who will agree with our opinions, regardless of where we stand on the future of XR. One thing is for certain, though, that every time someone experiences firsthand what VR and AR are capable of, they're blown away by the level of immersion and the medium's ability to convincingly transport them into another world. This level of immersion and interactivity is unparalleled, and teases many more possibilities as support for the platforms mature and technology continues to advance.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What concerns to keep in mind when developing VR or AR projects in Unity and what must be avoided</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Performance enhancements specific to the XR medium</li></ul></div></div>
