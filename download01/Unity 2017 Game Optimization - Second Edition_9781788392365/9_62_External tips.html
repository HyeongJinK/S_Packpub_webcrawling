However, hashtags are difficult to filter for tips you haven't seen before, and it tends to be abused for marketing. A great resource that pulls together a bundle of weekly tips from <code class="literal">#unitytips</code> can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://devdog.io/blog" target="_blank">http://devdog.io/blog</a>.</p><p>Googling Unity-related problems or concerns can go a lot faster if we start the search with <code class="literal">site:unity3d.com</code>, which will filter all results so that only those under the <code class="literal">unity3d.com</code> domain will appear.</p><p>If the Unity Editor crashes, for whatever reason, then we can potentially restore our Scene by renaming the following file to include the <code class="literal">.unity</code> extension (for Scene files), and copying it into our <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder:</p><pre class="programlisting">\&lt;project folder&gt;\Temp\_EditModeScene</pre><p>If we're developing on Windows, then there's very little reason not to use Visual Studio at this point. MonoDevelop has been dragged along kicking and screaming for many years, and many developers switched over to the more feature-rich Visual Studio Community Edition for most of their development workflow needs, particularly with incredibly helpful plugins such as Resharper.</p><p>There is a great resource for game programming patterns (or, rather, typical programming patterns explained in a way that is pertinent to game development), and it's completely free and available online. The following guide includes more information on several of the design patterns and game features we explored in this book, such as the Singleton Pattern, Observer Pattern, the Game Loop, and doubling-up on Frame Buffers:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" target="_blank">http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html</a></p><p>Keep an eye on any session videos that come from Unite conferences, whenever they happen (or better yet, try to attend them). There's usually a couple of panels at each conference held by Unity employees and experienced developers who will share lots of cool and interesting things they've been able to accomplish with the Engine and Editor. In addition to this, make sure that you involve yourself in the Unity community, through the forums on<a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank"> https://unity3d.com</a>, Twitter, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Unity Answers, or at whatever social gathering places pop out of the woodwork in the coming years.</p><p>Every single tip that was included in this book wasn't conjured out of thin air. It started out as an idea or tidbit of knowledge that someone shared somewhere at some point and somehow eventually found their way to this book's author. So, the best way to keep up to date on the best tips, tricks, and techniques is to keep our fingers on the pulse of where Unity is heading by staying involved in its community.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec137"></a>Other tips</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, the following section contains tips that didn't quite fit into other categories.</p><p>It's always a good idea to organize our Scenes using empty <code class="literal">GameObjects</code> as a parent for a group of objects while naming it to something sensible for that group. The only drawback to this method is that the empty object's <code class="literal">Transform</code> is included during position or rotation changes and gets included during recalculations, and as we know, reparenting a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> to another Transform has its own costs. Proper object referencing, <code class="literal">Transform</code> change caching, and/or use of <code class="literal">localPosition</code>/<code class="literal">localRotation</code> solve some of these problems adequately. In almost all cases, the benefits to workflow from Scene organization are significantly more valuable than such trivial performance losses.</p><p><span>Animator Override Controllers</span> were introduced way back in Unity v4.3, but tend to be forgotten or rarely mentioned. They are an alternative to standard Animation Controllers that allow us to reference an existing Animation Controller, and then override specific animation states to use different animation files. This allows for much faster workflows since we don't need to duplicate and tweak Animation Controllers multiple times; we only need to change a handful of animation states.</p><p>When Unity is launched, it automatically opens the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Wizard</code></strong>, allowing us to open a recent project. However, if we prefer the default behavior from Unity 4, which is to automatically open the previous project, we can edit this behavior by navigating to <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Preferences</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Load Previous Project</code></strong> on startup. Note that if the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Wizard</code></strong> is enabled, we can open multiple instances of Unity Editor simultaneously (although not to the same project).</p><p>The amazing customizability of the Unity Editor and its ever-growing feature set means that there are tons of little opportunities to improve workflows and more are being discovered or invented every single day. The Asset Store marketplace is absolutely rife with different products that try to solve some kind of problem that modern developers are having trouble with, which makes it a great place to browse if we're looking for ideas or, if we're willing, drop some money to save us a ton of hassle.</p><p>Since these assets tend to sell to a broad audience, this tends to keep prices low, and we can pick up some amazingly useful tools and scripts for surprisingly little cost. In almost all cases, it would take us a significant number of hours to develop the same solution ourselves. If we consider our time as valuable, then scanning the Asset Store on occasion can be a very cost-effective approach to development.</p></div></div>
