Firstly, the Resource System is not very scalable when it comes to builds. All Resources are merged together into a single massive Serialized File binary data blob with an index list of where various assets can be found within it. This can be hard to manage, and take a long time to build, as we add more data to the list.</p><p>Secondly, the Resource System's ability to acquire data from the Serialized File scales in an <code class="literal">Nlog(N)</code> fashion, which should make us very wary of increasing the value of <code class="literal">N</code>. Thirdly, the Resource System makes it unwieldy for our application to provide different asset data on a per-device basis, whereas Asset Bundles tend to make this matter trivial. Finally, Asset Bundles can be used to provide small, periodic custom content updates to the application, while the Resource System would require updates that completely replace the entire application to achieve the same effect.</p><p>Asset Bundles share a lot of common functionality with Resources such as loading from files, loading data asynchronously, and unloading data we no longer need. However, they also offer much more functionality such as content streaming, content updates, and content generation and sharing. These can all be used to improve the performance of our application to great effect. We can deliver applications with much smaller disk footprints and have the user download additional content before or during gameplay, stream assets at runtime to minimize the initial loading time of the application, and provide more optimized assets to the application on a per-platform basis without the need to push a complete application overwrite to the user.</p><p>Of course, there are downsides to Asset Bundles. They are much more complicated to set up and maintain than Resources, they're more complicated to understand since they use a much more sophisticated system for accessing asset data than the Resources System, and making full use of their <span>functionality </span>(such as streaming and content updates) would require a lot of additional QA testing to make sure that server is delivering content properly, and that the game is reading and updating its content to match. Ergo, Asset Bundles are best used only when our team size is able to support the extra workload they require.</p><p>A tutorial on the Asset Bundle system is beyond the scope of this book, but there are dozens of useful guides online and in the Unity Documentation.</p><p>Check out the following Unity tutorial to find out more about the Asset Bundle system:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/best-practices/guide-assetbundles-and-resources" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/best-practices/guide-assetbundles-and-resources</a>.</p><p>If you require further convincing, then the following Unity blog post from April 2017 should help reveal how the Asset Bundle system can use memory more efficiently during runtime in ways that the Resources System cannot provide through memory pooling: <a class="ulink" href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/04/12/asset-bundles-vs-resources-a-memory-showdown/" target="_blank">https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/04/12/asset-bundles-vs-resources-a-memory-showdown/</a>.</p></div>
