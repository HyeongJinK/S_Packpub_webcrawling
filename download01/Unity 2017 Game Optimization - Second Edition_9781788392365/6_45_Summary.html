That was a lot of information to absorb for just one subsystem of the Unity Engine, but then it is clearly the most complicated of them all, requiring a matching depth of explanation. Hopefully, you've learned a lot of approaches to help you improve your rendering performance and enough about the Rendering Pipeline to know how to use them responsibly.</p><p>By now, we should be used to the idea that, with the exception of algorithm improvements, every performance enhancement we implement will come with some related cost that we must be willing to bear for the sake of removing one bottleneck. We should always be ready to implement multiple techniques until we've squashed them all, and potentially spend a lot of additional development time to implement and test some performance enhancing features.</p><p>In the next chapter, let's bring performance optimization into the modern era by exploring some performance improvements we can apply to Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality projects.</p><p>Â </p></div>
