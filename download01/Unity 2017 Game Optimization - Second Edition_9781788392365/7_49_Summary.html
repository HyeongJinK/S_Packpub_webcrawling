The reassuring news is that we have many performance optimization options to choose from since Unity XR apps are built upon the same underlying platform we've been exploring throughout this book. Less reassuring is the fact that we might have to test and implement <span class="emphasis"><em>all of them</em></span> in order to stand a chance of reaching our quality goals. We can expect hardware to get more powerful over time, prices to come down, and adoption to increase as a result. However, until then, we need to pull out all of the stops if we're going to compete in the tech world's latest craze.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll dig into Unity's underlying Engine along with the various frameworks, layers, and languages that it is built from. In essence, we will take a look at our Script code in a more advanced light and investigate some methods to improve our CPU and memory management across the board.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
