Alternatively, from another perspective, there are plenty of ways to ruin our application's performance through asset mismanagement. Almost every single import configuration opportunity is a trade-off between one performance metric or workflow task and another. Typically, this means saving disk footprint via compression at the expense of CPU at runtime to decompress the data, or faster access while reducing the quality level of the final presentation. So, we must remain vigilant and only pick the right techniques for the right assets for the right reasons.</p><p>This concludes our exploration of improving performance through art asset manipulation. In the next chapter, we will be investigating how to improve our usage of Unity's Physics Engine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
