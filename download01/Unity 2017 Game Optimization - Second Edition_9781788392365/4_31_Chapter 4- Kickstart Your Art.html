It can be difficult to say whether, and why, one piece of art is better than the other, and it's likely that we won't be able to find complete consensus on our opinions. The technical aspects behind art assets that support a game's artistry can also be very subjective. There are multiple workarounds that can be implemented to improve performance, but these tend to result in a loss of quality for the sake of speed. If we're trying to reach peak performance then it's important that we consult with our team members whenever we decide to make any changes to our art assets, as it is primarily a balancing act, which can be an art form in itself.</p><p>Whether we're trying to minimize our runtime memory footprint, keeping the smallest possible executable size, maximizing loading speed, or maintaining consistency in frame rate, there are plenty of options to explore. There are some methods that are clearly always ideal, but most require a little more care and forethought before being adopted, as they would result in reduced quality or increase the chances of developing bottlenecks in other subsystems.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore how to improve performance for the following asset types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Texture files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Mesh and animation files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Asset Bundles and Resources</li></ul></div><p>In each case, we will investigate how Unity stores, loads, and manipulates these assets both during application build time and runtime. We will also examine our options in the event of performance issues, and what we can do to avoid behavior that might generate performance bottlenecks.</p></div>
