Such situations are often easy to spot, but can be tricky to refactor, and so exploiting this would be very implementation dependent. </p><p>Some examples might include finding an object in a Scene, reading data from a file, parsing data (such as XML or JSON), finding something in a big list or deep dictionary of information, calculating pathing for a group of <span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>) objects, complex mathematics-like trajectories, raycasting, and so on.</p><p>Think about each time an expensive operation is undertaken, and consider whether it is being called from multiple locations but always results in the same output. If this is the case, then it would be wise to restructure things so that the result is calculated once and then distributed to every object that needs it in order to minimize the amount of recalculation. The biggest cost is typically just a small loss in code simplicity, although some extra overhead may be inflicted by passing the value around.</p><p>Note that it's often easy to get into the habit of hiding some big complex function in a base class, and then we define derived classes that make use of that function, completely forgetting how costly that function is because we rarely glance at that code again. It’s best to use the Unity Profiler to tell us how many times that expensive function may be called, and as always, don't preoptimize those functions unless it’s been proven to be a performance issue. No matter how expensive it may be, if it doesn’t cause us to exceed performance restrictions (such as frame rate and memory consumption), then it’s not really a performance problem.</p></div>
