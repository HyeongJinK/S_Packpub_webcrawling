A common mistake is to only consider how long it will take to write the code required to create that feature. In which case, we are forgetting to include the time it takes for several important tasks. We often need to spend time refactoring other subsystems to support the changes we're making. This can happen either because we didn't think it would be necessary at the time, or <span>because we thought of a</span> better way to implement it halfway-through which can quickly turn into a rabbit-hole dive of redesign and refactoring if we don't plan sufficiently far ahead. We should also consider the time needed for testing and documentation. Even if a QA team will do a testing pass against the change after it has been implemented, we still need to run through some scenarios on our own system during implementation in order to ensure that the change actually does what's intended.</p><p>The one constant cost included in all performance optimization work is time. So, with limited time at our disposal to both implement the features we want to implement and keep everything working, an important skill to learn for any developer is workflow optimization. Better understanding of the tools we use will save us more time in the long run, and hopefully provide the extra time we need to implement everything we want to, which applies not only to the Unity Engine, but to every tool we use--IDEs, build systems, analytics systems, social media platforms, app stores, and so on.</p><p>There are a lot of little nuances to using the Unity Engine that can help improve our project workflow. However, quite a lot of the Editor's functionality is not well documented, well known, or just not something we think about until after quite some time--we realize the fact that it could have been applied perfectly to solve a particular problem we were having 6 months ago.</p><p>The <span>Internet</span> is crammed full of blogs, tweets, and forum posts that try to help other Unity developers learn about these useful features, but they only tend to focus on a handful of tips at a time. There don't seem to be any online resources that group together many of them in one place. As a result, the Internet browsers of intermediate and advanced Unity developers are probably bursting at the seams with links to these tips that we bookmark for later and then completely forget about.</p><p>So, because this book is primarily for such users, I felt like it was worth including a short chapter to pool together many of these tips and tricks in one location. This chapter serves as a reference list in the hope of saving us time during future development effort.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll cover tips and tricks for the following areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Convenient Editor hotkeys</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Better and faster ways to use the Unity Editor UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Ways to speed up or simplify our scripting practices</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Other tips that involve using external tools outside of Unity</li></ul></div></div>
