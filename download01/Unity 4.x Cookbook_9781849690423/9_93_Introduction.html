For some games, animation components can be sufficient for all such movements. However, other games use <span class="strong"><strong>directional logic</strong></span><a id="id643" class="indexterm"></a>â€”simple or sophisticated artificial intelligence involving the computer program that makes objects orient and move towards or away from the player or other game objects and characters. This chapter presents a range of such directional recipes, from which many games can benefit in terms of a richer and more exciting user experience.</p><p>Unity provides sophisticated classes and components, including the <code class="literal">Vector3</code> class, and rigid body physics for modeling realistic movements, forces, and collisions in games. We make use of these game engine features to implement some sophisticated <span class="strong"><strong>non-player character</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPC</strong></span>) object<a id="id644" class="indexterm"></a> movements in the recipes of this chapter.</p></div>
