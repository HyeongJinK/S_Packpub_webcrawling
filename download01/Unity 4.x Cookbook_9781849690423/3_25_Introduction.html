To create those maps, which are actually bitmap files (regardless of their file extension), it is necessary to use an image<a id="id138" class="indexterm"></a> editor such as Adobe Photoshop (which is the industry standard and has its native format supported by Unity), GIMP, and so on. In order to follow the recipes in this chapter, it's strongly recommended that you have access to software like this.</p><p>When saving texture maps, specially the ones that have an alpha channel, you might want to choose an adequate file format. PSD, Photoshop's native format, is practical for preserving the original artwork in many layers. TGA is also a good option for preserving the alpha channelâ€”although the image will be flattened.</p><p>Finally, before you start, it might be a good idea to read Unity's documentation on textures.
