Now, we will continue doing the same while creating our own <span class="strong"><strong>Role-Playing Games</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>RPG</strong></span>).</p><p>RPGs can always be fun to create and play; that's one of the reasons as to why they are so popular, regardless of whether they are 2D or 3D. One of the main differences between a 2D platform and 2D RPGs is that the second one has the top view rather than the side one. This has a big impact on both designing maps and programming the physics and movement of our characters.</p><p>Before starting to create our RPG, we need to get our assets ready that we will use in the game.</p></div>
