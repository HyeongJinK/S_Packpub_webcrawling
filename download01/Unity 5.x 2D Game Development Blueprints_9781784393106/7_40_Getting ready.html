We can call it <code class="literal">Tower Defense</code>, and after we have checked the 2D setting, let's click on create.</p><p>We have seen how it's possible to quickly create a tiled map in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">
<span class="emphasis"><em>Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Level Design</em></span>
, so feel free to create your map in that way. However, in this chapter, we will use a free package, which we can download at the following link: <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com" target="_blank">player26.com</a>.</p><p>The package, created by Lauren S. Ferro, includes all the basic assets to create our Tower Defense game, including a very nice map that perfectly fulfills our requirements. In particular, we will find:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A map with a road for Tower Defense games</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A set of different slime enemies</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Three levels of upgraded towers</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Multiple icons for each object of the package</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An arrow as a bullet</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Other interesting graphics (that we are not going to use) such as decorations, trees, and so on</p></li></ul></div><p>The following image can give us a better idea of which kind of graphics this package contains:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_07_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"></a>Tip</h3><p>Once imported, we may want to change the settings of our graphics, such as setting the quality to <code class="literal">Truecolor</code>.</p></div><p>So, after we have imported all of them, let's start.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip19"></a>Tip</h3><p>If our project is set to 3D, or if for some other reason the assets that we have imported are not set as Sprites, we have to do this in order to use them in this chapter. It is possible to change this setting by selecting them from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Texture Type</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Sprite (2D and UI)</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
