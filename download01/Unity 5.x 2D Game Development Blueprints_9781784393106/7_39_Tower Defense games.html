Here, instead, we will see how we can use Unity to create a Tower Defense game.</p><p>Usually, in these kinds of games, there is a road along which the players have to place towers. This is in order to stop a horde of terrible enemies that try relentlessly to reach the end of the path to apply some damage to the player.</p><p>Creating a Tower Defense game with many levels can be done relatively easily, once all the main logic behind the game has been implemented. In fact, due to the modularity of each component, creating a new map is very easy, and also the re-playability of the game is high, since in every level the player can decide to use different strategies.</p><p>In this chapter, we will see how to implement the basic elements, which we will use in further chapters to create our Tower Defense game.</p><p>Before jumping into the action, we need to get our assets ready to be used in the game.</p></div>
