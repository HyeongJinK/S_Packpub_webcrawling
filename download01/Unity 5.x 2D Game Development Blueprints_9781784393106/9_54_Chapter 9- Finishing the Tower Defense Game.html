We will do this by creating a <span class="strong"><strong>Game Manager</strong></span> that will control the entire flow of the game.</p><p>In particular, we will learn how to exchange information from the Game Manager to other elements, such as indicating to enemies the way to go, or decreasing the number of lives that the player has when the enemies have reached the end of their path. This also requires that we integrate the UI which we created in the previous chapter.</p><p>Later, we will see how to allow the player to place their own towers where they want in the map, but still having some constraints about the areas.</p><p>Then, we will learn how we can spawn enemies and how to set the <span class="emphasis"><em>game over</em></span> conditions, both for winning and losing.</p><p>Finally, for those who have finished the optional section in the previous chapter about how to upgrade the tower, here they will learn how to finish what they started by modifying the <code class="literal">TowerScript</code>.</p><p>At the end of this chapter, there is a section with some suggestions about how you might improve your game on your own while improving your skills along the way. As the saying goes: <span class="emphasis"><em>practice makes perfect</em></span>.
