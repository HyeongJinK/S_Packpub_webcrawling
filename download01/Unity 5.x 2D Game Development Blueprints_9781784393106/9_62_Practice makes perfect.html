Congratulations!</p><p>However, there is always space to improve your skills. Thus, the aim of this section is to give you some directions on how you can improve your game and continue developing your skills.</p><p>The first thing that you can do is to extend the game into more than one level. This means creating a new map and loading it when the player wins the current one. Also, you need to redo some of the steps completed in this chapter, such as tweaking the <code class="literal">GameManager</code> to adapt it to the map. This includes setting waypoints and the allowed areas again.</p><p>In order to add a bit more fun to the game, you can create other kinds of enemies. Actually, the package used in this book has different enemies that you can use. They will use the same <code class="literal">EnemyScript</code> we have written, but with different parameters, such as moving faster. Also, remember to change the spawning system to spawn them too, maybe to spawn more than one enemy per time and organize them into waves as well.</p><p>Another interesting thing you could do is to create a map with different paths for the enemies, and use waypoints to decide which one the enemy will take. Additionally, you can implement the closure of the Tower menu when the player clicks on an empty spot in the map.</p><p>If you are thinking of publishing your game, then you shouldn't forget about audio and music. They are nice additions, and can create a great atmosphere for gameplay. Furthermore, audio can be used to give some feedback to the player of what is going on. For instance, when they try to place a tower in an area where they cannot, a sound may help them to understand that they cannot place it there. Moreover, you can complement audio feedback with visuals, which are also important for a game's success.</p><p>Finally, if you really want to push your skills and challenge yourself, you should try to optimize the code presented in this book to make it run more efficiently. Some suggestions on how to make some improvements have been left in the text as tips.</p></div>
