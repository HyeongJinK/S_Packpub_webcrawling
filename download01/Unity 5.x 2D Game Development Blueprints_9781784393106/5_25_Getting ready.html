<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec26"></a>Getting ready</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Let's open up Unity and create a new project, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_001.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Make sure that the 2D mode is selected, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Asset packages...</strong></span>, and select <span class="strong"><strong>2D</strong></span>, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"></a>Note</h3><p>Keep in mind that the <code class="literal">Standard Assets</code> need to be downloaded from the Asset Store, as we did in <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a></em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Sprites</em></span>.</p></div><p>Press the <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span> button, and as a result the project is created. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, create two new folders named <code class="literal">Scripts</code> and <code class="literal">Scenes</code>. Inside <code class="literal">Scenes</code> save an empty scene and name it <code class="literal">Scene1</code>, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>One last thing to do is to import our assets. As we did in <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a></em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Stripes</em></span>, we can use the free assets from the <a class="ulink" href="http://kenney.nl" target="_blank">http://kenney.nl</a> website (just remember that we will also need software to decompress). In particular, we need the RPG packs. You can find them at the following link: <a class="ulink" href="http://kenney.nl/assets?s=rpg" target="_blank">http://kenney.nl/assets?s=rpg</a>.</p><p>Of course, don't forget to import them into Unity before continuing on with the chapter. Furthermore, you can also reorder them, so that they are easier to find later. For instance, you can start to place all the packages into one folder called <code class="literal">RPGPack</code>. Then, divide this folder into sub-folders such as <code class="literal">Characters</code> and <code class="literal">Environment</code>. You will see this done throughout the rest of the chapter.</p></div>
