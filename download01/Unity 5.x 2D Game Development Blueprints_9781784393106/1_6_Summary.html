In particular, we have discussed the 2D mode, importing <code class="literal">Sprites</code>, the <code class="literal">Sprite Renderer</code> component, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>. We also learned how to use sprites in our game and how to script a character to make it move along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-axis.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will bring our character to life by adding animations into our game!</p></div>
