So far, we have added animations to our character to be played according to the player controls. A brief summary of what we have discussed would be creating animations, animator controllers, state machines for <code class="literal">Animation</code>, and using animations in our game through the use of <code class="literal">Scripts</code>.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will make things even more realistic by using physics and applying it to our game.</p></div>
