Inside this, we have implemented the logic to keep a lives counter, a money counter, and a tower seller. Furthermore, for those who wanted to challenge themselves, we have also seen how to implement a menu for the towers to make them sellable and upgradable.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to polish the project and finalize it by implementing a game manager and wrapping everything together.</p></div>
