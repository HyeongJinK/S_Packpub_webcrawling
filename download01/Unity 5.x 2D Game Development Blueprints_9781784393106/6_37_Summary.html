We discussed pathfinding, the AStar Algorithm, and how to apply AI in Unity.</p><p>Unluckily, this is it for our RPG. In fact, to develop an entire game with all the features would require several books. However, in these last two chapters we gave a good foundation for learning more.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will move onto our last project, where we will use all of the skills that we have learnt so far to create a strategy game.</p></div>
