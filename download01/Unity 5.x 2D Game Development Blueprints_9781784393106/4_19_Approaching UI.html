<a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, User Interface for the Tower Defense Game</em></span>. However, I recommend that you read a specific book about UI, if you want to master it. For instance, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity UI Cookbook</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span>.</p><p>To make our level a little more enjoyable, we should add some UI elements to indicate the player's health and score. So let's do that!</p><p>In order to add some UI elements, we need a canvas. Usually, every time we create a UI element for the first time in the scene, a canvas is created as well. However, you can also create one by right-clicking in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Canvas</strong></span>. A new object is added to our scene, with the name <code class="literal">Canvas</code>.</p><p>A canvas is an area that all UI elements must be children of. Let's start by adding some UI text under it. We can add it by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then <span class="strong"><strong>UI</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Text</strong></span>. As a result, a new object named <code class="literal">Text</code> under <code class="literal">Canvas</code> has been created.</p><p>First, let's rename our <code class="literal">Text</code> object to <code class="literal">HealthText</code> and then adjust its position so that it is positioned at the top-left of the game view. We can achieve this by choosing the top-left anchor:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_025.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Next, adjust the<span class="strong"><strong> Rect Transform</strong></span> accordingly, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_026.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Next, change the <code class="literal">Text</code> component attached to the <code class="literal">HealthText</code> object to match the properties, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_027.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As a result, we will have this in our <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_028.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>We need to add three more text objects, which are all parented to the canvas, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_029.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>HealthText</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>ScoreText</strong></span> texts should be <span class="strong"><strong>Health:</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Score:</strong></span> respectively; as for <span class="strong"><strong>HealthValue</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>ScoreValue</strong></span> texts, they should be <code class="literal">2</code> and 0, respectively. Note that the last two texts will be referenced later, in a script, so that they can be changed in-game to show the player stats.</p><p>As a result, our <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view should look as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_030.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Let's add two more texts to our canvas, named <code class="literal">GameOver</code> and <code class="literal">YouWin</code>, which will be shown to the player when one of the two events occur. Don't forget to disable both objects so that they don't appear while we are playing the level! You can disable them by unchecking the box, located next to their name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>. We will enable them again, in-game, when they are needed:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_031.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>For the <span class="strong"><strong>Game Over</strong></span> screen, we could create something like this:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_032.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Whereas, for the <span class="strong"><strong>Winning</strong></span> screen, we could have the following:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_04_033.jpg" /></div><p>
</p></div>
