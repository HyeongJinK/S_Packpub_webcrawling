Open <code class="literal">roguelike-pack/Map/sample_map</code> in <code class="literal">Tiled</code>. If you missed the previous chapter where we discussed <code class="literal">Tiled</code>, you should at least read that section before you continue. In fact, it is another software, separate from Unity:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_004.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, the scene is almost complete. We will not need to spend much time to make it game-ready:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_005.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, we need to set up the colliders for our scene and it's best to do it from here. This task can be tiring and boring, but it's definitely worth it.</p><p>Let's start by selecting the lake's top-left sprite inside the tileset:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_006.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now go to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tile Collision Editor</strong></span> and enclose it with the rectangular tool so that it looks as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_007.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we need to do the same to every sprite object that should be a collider to the player inside the game; these include: tree trunks, houses, roofs, tents, crosses, and so on...</p><p>After all the <span class="strong"><strong>Colliders</strong></span> have been properly set up, save the map and open the file from <code class="literal">Tiled2Unity</code>, as shown in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_008.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Go to: <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Unity Package To Project</strong></span> then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> inside Unity:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_009.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>You can make sure the colliders are properly set up by clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span>. Adjust the scale to <code class="literal">0.018</code> and make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>Export To</strong></span> is pointing at the <code class="literal">Tiled2Unity.export</code> file inside our project at <code class="literal">Assets/Tiled2Unity</code>. Finally, press <span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span> to add the map to our project.</p><p>After the map has been imported, drag the <code class="literal">sample_map</code> prefab from <span class="strong"><strong>Tiled2Unity</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> to our scene and rename it <code class="literal">Map</code>. Furthermore, set its <span class="strong"><strong>Rect Transform</strong></span>, as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_010.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>Now, we need to rename the camera object from <code class="literal">MainCamera</code> to <code class="literal">Camera</code> and set the camera size to <code class="literal">3.5</code>. The scene should look like this now:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_05_011.jpg" /></div><p>
