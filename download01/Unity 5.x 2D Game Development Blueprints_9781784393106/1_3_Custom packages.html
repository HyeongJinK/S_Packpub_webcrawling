In particular, you need to download the following package: <a class="ulink" href="http://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-deluxe" target="_blank">http://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-deluxe</a>.</p><p>Once the file has been downloaded, it is compressed, so we will need to open it with a software for decompression.</p><p>As you can see, there are many folders containing different expansions of the pack. We only need the <code class="literal">basepack</code> folder. We need to copy this folder into the <code class="literal">Asset</code> folder in Unity. You can do this by just dragging and dropping it in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Finally, we can rename it <code class="literal">PlatformerPack</code>, so our project will be better organized.</p></div>
