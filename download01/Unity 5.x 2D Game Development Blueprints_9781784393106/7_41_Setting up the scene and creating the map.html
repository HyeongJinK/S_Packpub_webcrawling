This can be easily done by creating a new Sprite by right-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and then selecting <code class="literal">2D Object/Sprite</code>.</p><p>Now, we can assign the map in the package to the Sprite variable by dragging and dropping it on the variable. The name of the asset should be <code class="literal">map-01</code>. Moreover, we should set all the components of its position to 0, especially the <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>-axis, and rename it, <code class="literal">Map</code>. Our <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> should appear like this:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_07_002.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><p>The next step is to set the camera. To do this, we need to select it and then change its <code class="literal">Size</code> variable to fit our map. In this case, we can set its value to <code class="literal">22.5</code>. As a result, the whole map is visible by the camera, as in the following image:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781784393106/graphics/image_07_003.jpg" /></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip20"></a>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that some of the space could be needed to create the UI, which we will see in the next chapter. However, the position and the size of the camera can be changed later, when we will have a better idea of which kind of UI will fill that extra space.</p></div><p>Finally, if we have some other nice assets or particle effects, we can add them to the scene to decorate it even more. For instance, in the package, there is also a tree, or an extra texture that can be placed on top of the map to improve the road.</p><p>Now that we have the scene ready with the map, let's start to build the main elements for our strategic game, starting with the bullets.</p></div>
