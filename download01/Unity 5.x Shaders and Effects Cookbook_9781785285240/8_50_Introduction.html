With these screen effects, we can create stunning real-time images with Bloom, Motion Blur, HDR effects, and so on. Most modern games out in the market today make heavy use of these Screen effects for their depth of field effects, bloom effects, and even color correction effects.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, you will learn how to build up the script system that gives us the control to create these screen effects. We will cover Render Textures, what the depth buffer is, and how to create effects that give you Photoshop-like control over the final rendered image of your game. By utilizing screen effects for your games, you not only round out your shader writing knowledge, but you will also have the power to create your own incredible real-time renders with Unity.</p></div>
