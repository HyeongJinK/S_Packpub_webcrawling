What they lack in expressivity, they compensate with power: Vertex and Fragment Shaders are not limited by physical constraints and are perfect for non-photorealistic effects. This chapter will focus on a technique <a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a>called <span class="strong"><strong>grab pass</strong></span>, which allows these shaders to simulate deformations.</p></div>
