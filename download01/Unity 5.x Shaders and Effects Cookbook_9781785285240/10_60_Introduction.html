You should remember that many of the most eye-catching effects you can see in games are made by testing the limit of what shaders can do. This book provides you with the technical basis to modify and create shaders, but you are strongly encouraged to play and experiment with them as much as you can. Making a good game is not a quest for photorealism; you should not approach shaders with the intention of replicating reality because this is unlikely to happen. Instead, you should try to use shaders as a tool to make your game truly unique. With the knowledge of this final chapter, you will be able to create the materials that you want.</p></div>
