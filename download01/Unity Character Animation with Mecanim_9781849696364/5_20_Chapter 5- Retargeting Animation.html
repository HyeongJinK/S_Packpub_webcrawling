This chapter will demonstrate how motion sequences such as these can be reused for different characters.</p><p>Mecanim's robust animation toolset allows users to reuse animation sequences in different characters. Provided that both characters use the <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> animation type (specified in the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> settings), a great deal of variation within skeletons is possible. Mecanim will identify and convert animation sequences based on the bone's position in the skeletal hierarchy, eliminating the necessity of identical (and identically named) rigs.</p><p>If you are creating animation sequences from scratch using traditional keyframe animation techniques, it does not take much extra time to animate extra bones, such as ponytails and accessories in a character's rig. However, when it becomes necessary to use pre-made animations and incorporate motion capture data, it can be a time-consuming process to adapt and refine a generic animation to fit a key character within the game.</p><p>In this chapter, we will demonstrate Mecanim's animation retargeting capacity with the following objectives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Copying and modifying an animation sequence for a different character</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adjusting animation import settings to get a better fit</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Modifying muscle parameters to limit a character's range of movement</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Using animation masks and layers and accommodating these in the script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Varying a walk sequence using animation masks</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Retargeting the male walk animation for the female zombie character</p></li></ul></div><p>To demonstrate the retargeting capabilities of Mecanim, we will continue with the walk sequences created for the male zombie in the previous chapter, this time adapting one of the walk cycles for his female counterpart.</p></div>
