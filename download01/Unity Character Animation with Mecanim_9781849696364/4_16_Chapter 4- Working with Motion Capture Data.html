In more complex animation sequences, traditional keyframe animation techniques are sometimes too time consuming. With motion capture processes becoming more affordable and available, many independent game developers are exploiting this technology to add a dynamic edge to their projects.</p><p>In this chapter we will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Explain the characteristics of motion capture files</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Demonstrate the creation of two distinct walk cycles from one motion capture file</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Set up a simple scene, animator controller, and script to test the resulting motion clips</p></li></ul></div><p>This chapter will feature the male zombie character that was imported and prepared in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Zombie Attacks!</em></span>.
