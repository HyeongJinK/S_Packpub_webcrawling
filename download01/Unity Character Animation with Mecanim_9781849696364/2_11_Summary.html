We then used the skin modifier to connect the rig to the character model, fine tuning the envelope settings to correct the range of influence from each bone until the character deformed smoothly in the test pose that we created.</p><p>Working in Maya, we created a full hierarchy of joints from scratch, by assembling individual chains of joints for the spine, leg, and arm. We implemented workable naming conventions, before mirroring our joint chains to complete the main skeleton. After adding additional joints for the ponytail and jaw, we used smooth bind to define the relationship between the rig and the character model and fine tuned this with the Paint Weights tool until the characters vertices appeared to be appropriately influenced by the joints in our test pose.</p><p>At this point, you should be ready to dive into Unity and bring a character to life, exploring environmental interaction in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Interacting with the Environment</em></span>. This time, we will be using the Mecanim tools to set up an initial state machine for our first person character model.</p></div>
