We introduced the <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> import settings, demonstrated how seamless loops can be created, and how a number of unique walk cycles could be derived from a single motion capture sequence.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at animation retargeting and how an animation clip can be used for characters of different types. We will look at how optional bones come into play and how variations in characters can be accommodated within Mecanim's toolset.</p></div>
