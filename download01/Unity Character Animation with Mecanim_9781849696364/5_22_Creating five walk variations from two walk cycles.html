In the next step we will further vary these by masking the head, arms, and legs from each sequence:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><p>In the Unity project, open the scene <code class="literal">Chapter5_3</code>.</p><p>The scene is the same simple room interior, but this time containing five identical male zombies.</p><p>Currently each of the zombie characters shares the same animator controller.
