<span class="strong"><strong>Polycount</strong></span>: Think about how many times the model is likely to be shown on screen and how big it will be. Typically, characters that are only present in the background or <a id="id65" class="indexterm"></a>those that are repeated multiple times, would contain less polygons to free up system resources, and maintain a<a id="id66" class="indexterm"></a> consistent frame rate. The polycount is the amount of triangles, which the character is made up of. This can often be kept to a minimum by deleting unseen parts of a model and reducing the complexity of less important areas.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mesh density</strong></span>: In order to maintain the semblance of a smooth, continuous surface, modelers <a id="id67" class="indexterm"></a>often organize their character's topology by the direction and flow of edges. A ring of edges is called an <a id="id68" class="indexterm"></a><span class="strong"><strong>Edge Loop</strong></span>. Typically, more edge loops will be necessary on the parts of the mesh that deform. Shoulders, knees, and elbows need to be reinforced to support the deformation caused by joints. Similarly, areas that do not bend or deform can have less edge loops, as the mesh only needs to support the static shape.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Quads and triangles</strong></span>: The 3D applications (including game engines such as Unity) render triangles. Most modeling workflows use quadrangles (or quads), which <a id="id69" class="indexterm"></a>subdivide more evenly and are easier to UV map and animate. If your model contains anything other than quads or triangles, such as pentagons or hexagons or higher (generally termed<a id="id70" class="indexterm"></a> <span class="strong"><strong>ngons</strong></span>), you will risk unpredictable results when you try to rig and animate. It is advised to stick to triangles and quads when you are modeling your characters.</p></li></ul></div></div>
