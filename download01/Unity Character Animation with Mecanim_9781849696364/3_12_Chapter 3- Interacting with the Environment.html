Our game will involve more than just shooting, so we will see the character's hands and arms—this will allow us to demonstrate different kinds of animation within Unity.</p><p>Mecanim will allow us to<a id="id201" class="indexterm"></a> trigger animations according to player input and other conditions—try to think beyond the simple playing of an animation sequence when a button is pushed—Mecanim is capable of more than this and can bring about a richer user experience.</p><p>The interactive aspect of the game also necessitates setting up ready made objects called prefabs that our player can collect during the game.</p><p>We will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The player character game object and its components</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>First-person camera adjustment</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding animation sequences</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding a weapon</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Importing, previewing, and implementing animation sequences</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The animator controller – player state machine</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mecanim-friendly animation scripting</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Creating and using prefabs</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Scripting animation responses for collectables</p></li></ul></div><p>Working through this chapter will give you an understanding of how player interaction can be achieved and how animation can be used to present the player's connection to the space.</p></div>
