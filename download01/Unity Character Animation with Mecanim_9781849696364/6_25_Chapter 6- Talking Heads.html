Mecanim's <span class="strong"><strong>Humanoid</strong></span> animation type has a small predefined set of bones that will accommodate face animation. This <a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a>can be layered within the animator controller, effectively separating body and face animation to be triggered under different conditions.</p><p>There are several valid reasons due to which we may want to separate out face and body animations—we want the player to be given a sign that the enemy has spotted them. We do not have a way of determining what state the enemy character is in when they spot the player. We do not want them to immediately attack, however, we want to give the player an opportunity to react before the enemy. After all, the enemy is a slow moving zombie.</p><p>In this chapter, you will be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Preparing conditions in the scene to allow a triggered response</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Updating the zombie's script to allow it to target and move toward the player</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implementing an audio asset using a component and the script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Adding the face skeletal animation to the animator in its own masked layer</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Controlling a blendshape animation in the animator</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Controlling the zombie's turn and add further animation</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Splitting behavior into self-contained functions within the script</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Accurately synchronizing the sound using an animation event</p></li></ul></div><p>We will start by demonstrating the existing simple behavior with the female zombie character and simple room environment both introduced previously.</p></div>
