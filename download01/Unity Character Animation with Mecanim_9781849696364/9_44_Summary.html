I hope to have demonstrated that Mecanim is a powerful and dynamic toolset for character animation.</p><p>Its visual representation of state machines, and its ability to create complex animation routines, even with very little code make it an essential tool for anyone interested in animation in games.</p><p>The potential uses of this toolset are expanding every day with a very large and active user base sharing problems and solutions on Unity's community forums.</p></div>
