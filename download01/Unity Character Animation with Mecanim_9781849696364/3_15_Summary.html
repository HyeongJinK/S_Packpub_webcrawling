We started by setting up a first-person controller to work with our player character model. We then created a state machine in the <span class="strong"><strong>Animator</strong></span> window for our player and added the appropriate motion clips. We set up the switch between states using a player animation script.</p><p>Finally, we added health power-ups for the player to collect in the level, and scripted a player response with the use of an additional camera and the player status script.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will return to our enemy characters and demonstrate how motion capture data can be implemented within a Mecanim-ready character.</p><p>We will define frame ranges in a source file to create useable loops, which can then be set up in the zombie character's state machine.</p></div>
