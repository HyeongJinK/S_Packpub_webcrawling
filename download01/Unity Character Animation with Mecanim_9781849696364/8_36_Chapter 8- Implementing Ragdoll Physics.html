<span class="strong"><strong>Ragdoll</strong></span> physics is a<a id="id471" class="indexterm"></a> method that involves a system of joints connecting weighted body parts used to create a real-time animation sequence.</p><p>Unlike, traditional keyframe animation that is created in external 3D software and imported to Unity, the ragdoll object will interact with forces within the game. This means that the enemy will fall to the ground in different ways based on the applied force and the scenery that it collides with.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Demonstrate the use of Unity's Rigidbody and Joint components</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Demonstrate the creation of a ragdoll from an existing character with the Ragdoll Wizard</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Show the adjustment of collision objects to fit the character model</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add custom joints for parts of the rig not covered by the wizard</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Set limits to approximate realistic joint rotation.</p></li></ul></div><p>When the zombie character is killed, we will replace the animated game object with the ragdoll game object, allowing it to fall to the ground and react with other physical objects.</p><p>We will start with a brief overview of Unity's joints.</p></div>
