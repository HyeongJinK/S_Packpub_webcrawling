When rigged, a character will have defined joints, which will allow it to articulate in a realistic way.</p><p>A key difference between rigging for a game engine like Unity and rigging for a non real-time animation is that we do not need to set up full character controls in our 3D software.</p><p>On export, controls and other helpers will typically be deleted leaving just the mesh, bones, and animation (if there is any). This makes rigging a model for Unity a little easier.</p></div>
