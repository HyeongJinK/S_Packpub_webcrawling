Advances in movement control in game consoles such as Wii, Playstation, and Xbox have made simple motion capture using markerless motion capture more affordable and accessible.</p><p>The motion<a id="id283" class="indexterm"></a> capture sequences provided as examples with this book were captured with a Kinect sensor connected to a PC. Motion capture is used in <a id="id284" class="indexterm"></a>video games for the same reasons that it is used in visual effects in the movie industry.</p><p>The convincing <a id="id285" class="indexterm"></a>movement of the human form is sufficiently complex to take a long time to perfect using traditional keyframe animation. Rather than just animate a series of joints or bones, you have to consider how these joints and bones move together. Secondary animation effects, such as balance and counterweight, are vitally important for the human motion to look real. In fast or particularly energetic sequences, these can be very difficult to achieve.</p><p>Like traditional animation, motion capture is done with a target frame rate in order to optimize quality and keep the resulting file sizes within useable boundaries. Using the economical methods available, the number of bones or joints that can be captured is limited, and there is very little support for the capture of facial expression and complex hand animation. Neither of these are substantially supported in the current version of Unity anyway.</p><p>Because of the <a id="id286" class="indexterm"></a>amount of data captured, it is a good idea to limit the length of each motion capture take. Trimming and cleaning up motion capture sequences is also an important step in using this technology efficiently within the parameters of game development.</p></div>
