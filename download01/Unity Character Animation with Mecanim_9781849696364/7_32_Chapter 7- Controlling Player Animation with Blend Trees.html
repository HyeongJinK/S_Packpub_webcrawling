The player can walk, shoot, and pick up items.</p><p>The motion sequences were set up in separate states in the controller's base layer to define how the character would transition through its motion sequences. In the transitions that link the states together, we used a Boolean operator to determine when the player would shoot or pick up an item.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore a further level of animation blending within Mecanim. <span class="strong"><strong>Blend Trees</strong></span> are specialized <a id="id418" class="indexterm"></a>states that can contain many motion sequences.</p><p>The use of Blend Trees will add a further level of realism to the game, by blending in subtle animation variations based on the player's input.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Implement a Blend Tree to add strafe animation to the existing player character</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Demonstrate the use of parameters, thresholds, and other Blend Tree properties</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Demonstrate the blending of animation sequences driven by player input</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Updating the existing character animation script to be compatible with the Blend Tree</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Use external variables, such as object weight to drive animation blending</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>View the Blend Tree in action during play mode</p></li></ul></div><p>We will start with a simple implementation of a Blend Tree to include variations to the player's idle animation.</p></div>
