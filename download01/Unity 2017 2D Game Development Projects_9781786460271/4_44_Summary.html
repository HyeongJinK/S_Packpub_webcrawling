We have also seen some examples of different kinds of UIs and how the four types of UI—diegetic, non-diegetic, spatial, and Meta all differ from each other and how they can be used within a game.</p><p>Then, we explored some concepts of how Unity handles UIs before diving into implementing the UI for our <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span> game. In particular, we have created a script for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Score</code></strong>, which integrates with the <code class="literal">CollectableCake</code> script of <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Make Some Prefabs</em></span>. We have also included a <strong class="userinput"><code>Game Over Screen</code></strong> to show when the Angel collects all the cakes.</p><p>Lastly, we have explored some suggestions about how to go on developing our game to make it even more awesome than it currently is. Of course, this chapter only provided a brief overview of some of the many important components of UIs, so I highly recommend that you also explore the design and practicality of UIs with other online/offline resources. One resource is the Interaction Design Foundation, ;<a class="ulink" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/" target="_blank">www.interaction-design.org</a>. While it focuses more on UX, there are many great resources on UIs to check out.</p><p>Now, with this chapter, we have concluded our first game. It is, therefore, time to start another one. For our next game, we will go into deep space to meet new friends in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Freeze! Creating an Intergalactic Shooter</em></span>. So set your phasers to stun, because things are about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p></div>
