While both use the same concepts, such as gravity, force, and velocity, they are implemented in slightly different ways, especially since there isn't a third dimension in 2D games. There are several components and properties when it comes to 2D physics in Unity. However, the two main important components to understand this book will be <code class="literal">Colliders</code> and <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code>, since we are going to use them both to implement our <span class="strong"><strong>PlayerController</strong></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"></a>Rigidbody</h3></div></div></div><p>A <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> is the main component that allows game objects to engage in physical behavior (that is, movement). When a <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> is attached to a <code class="literal">GameObject</code>, the object will immediately respond to gravity. Since a <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> takes over the movement of the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> it is attached to, you shouldn't try to move it from a script by changing the Transform properties such as position, rotation, or scale. Instead, you should apply forces to push (for example, other characters, objects, projectiles) the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> and let the physics engine calculate the results. There are some cases where you might want a <code class="literal">GameObject</code> to have a <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> without having its motion controlled by the physics engine. For example, you may want to control your character directly from script code but still, allow it to be detected by triggers. This kind of non-physical motion produced from a script is known as <span class="strong"><strong>kinematic motion</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> component has a property called <span class="strong"><strong>Is Kinematic</strong></span> that removes it from the control of the physics engine and allows it to be moved kinematically from a script. It is possible to change the value of <strong class="userinput"><code>Is Kinematic</code></strong> from a script to allow physics to be switched on and off for an object, but this comes with a performance overhead and should be used sparingly.</p><p>If one or more <code class="literal">Collider</code> components are also added, the <code class="literal">GameObject</code> is moved by incoming collisions. We discuss <code class="literal">Collider</code> components in the next section.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"></a>Colliders</h3></div></div></div><p><code class="literal">Collider</code> components define the shape of an object for the purpose of physical collisions. You can think of this as an invisible box that is an object that permits it from passing through it but without coming into contact. They don't have to be the same shape as the visual representation (Mesh, Sprite) of the object; in some cases they can be a simple primitive type (for example, Box <code class="literal">Collider</code>, Sphere <code class="literal">Collider</code> (only in 3D), and Capsule <code class="literal">Collider</code>), but the closer to the actual shape, the better. If you're using many different primitive types of colliders within Unity, you can combine them to create what is called a Compound <code class="literal">Collider</code>.
In 2D, you can also use what is called a Polygon Collider 2D or Edge Collider 2D. A Polygon Collider 2D is a collider that is shaped by freeform edges that you can adjust so that it better suits your Sprite. It must also enclose the edges of the area that it is trying to provide a collider around. An Edge Collider 2D is defined by a freeform edge made of line segments, so you can adjust it to fit the shape of a Sprite with great precision. In general, Edge colliders are best for surfaces (for example, game platforms) because you are only generating geometry where you need it.</p><p>Another important thing to consider when using colliders is the type of Material that they are made of. For example, a player jumping on a springboard is going to result in a very different behavior than landing on spikes. Applying Physics Materials to objects can be done to 2D objects by using Physics Material 2D. It is important not to forget the "s" as Physic Material (without the "s" in Physics) is reserved for 3D Physics Materials. Lastly, Physics Materials in Unity 2D have two properties: Friction and Bounciness, as in the following image. We will touch on these later for <span class="emphasis"><em>Project 3 - RETROformer</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/c8dfbb01-8393-4979-9877-bc587cd22705.png" /></div></div></div>
