We have learned how to set up different layers (such as Terrain and Water), so to better distinguish the different parts of the map once we import everything back into Unity. We used another tool named <code class="literal">Tiled2Unity</code> to export the map created in Tiled into Unity and learned how to set the environment up. We will continue with the environment in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch10">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Get Physical</em></span>. But for now, it's time to jump into <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Look, It Moves</em></span>, in which we will learn more about the Animation State machine, and we will build a more complex one.</p></div>
