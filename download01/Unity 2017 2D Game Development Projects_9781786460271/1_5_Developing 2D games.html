Here, we'll go through the most common ones, and touch on other relevant ones throughout the book. While you don't need a complete understanding of these differences, the ones here are important to keep in mind if you're new to 2D game development.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec6"></a>X, Y, and Z-axis</h3></div></div></div><p>The first obvious difference between 2D and 3D is that 2D utilizes only two axes: X and Y; whereas 3D has an additional Z-axis. To explain how this works from a games perspective, see the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/81175a98-12f6-4be1-a8c0-34f78436cb18.jpg" /></div><p>Generally speaking, the z-axis is used for depth and is utilized so that the player can explore an environment like they would in reality whether it is from a third person or first-person perspective camera. The z-axis allows the added third dimension to an environment. 2.5D games utilize the z-axis to provide a sense of depth because the game is still fixed to the x and y-axes.</p><p>In saying that, it is important to know the differences between 2D, 2.5D, and 3D games. While there are many different stories, quests, and adventures that games can take us on, these experiences, at least in terms of their appearance and design, will differ depending on what axis they are using—x, y, or z.  Before we start creating any game in this book, we'll just briefly go through some examples of 3D and various types of 2D style games. In this way, you will learn about the differences between the two and what types of experiences that they can afford.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec6"></a>Full 3D</h4></div></div></div><p>These games are everything from <span class="emphasis"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></span> (featured in the following screenshot to <span class="emphasis"><em>Skyrim</em></span> and everything in between. They are completely 3D immersive, explorable, and interactable environments. When you think about the design of a 3D game, you need to think about what the physical environment will look like. What kind of objects will be in it? How does the player navigate around them and through the world? For example, think about where you are right now.</p><p>If you had to turn your current environment into one that would be in a video game, what kinds of objects would you need to create? Perhaps a desk or chair, maybe a lamp? Then, how would players interact with these objects? What kind of effects would occur, such as a player turning the lamp on or off?</p><p>There are many basic and intricate details that go into making a 3D environment. Of course, they are not exclusive to 3D environments, as we will see in the other types of games, but these are some fundamental considerations.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/1042c585-285b-44f4-ac27-ca75e87139ed.png" /></div><p><span>Screenshot</span> of Assassin's Creed</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec7"></a>Orthographic (3D)</h4></div></div></div><p>Just like the name suggests, orthographic 3D is a 3D game that is played from an orthographic perspective. Sometimes, these are also referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>Isometric</em></span> games and are given this name because of the perspective that they are played in. Some popular orthographic games include <span class="emphasis"><em>Diablo</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Q*bert</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Monument Valley</em></span> (featured next).</p><p>Unlike 3D, and depending on the type of gameplay that is required (for example, can the player rotate the environment?), the player will more than likely not see all sides of the game environment. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/b03287f4-cda0-4ba9-9e88-bd58fb58fb71.png" /></div><p>Screenshot of Monument Valley</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec8"></a>2D with 3D graphics, also known as 2.5D</h4></div></div></div><p>Think of 2.5D simply as a 3D environment constrained to a 2D plane (for example, x, y-axis). In other words, the player can only move up and down, left or right; they are not able to move on the z-axis. The use of 3D is merely used mostly for an aesthetic purpose, such as to show the depth of an environment. An example is shown next, with a screenshot taken from the game <span class="emphasis"><em>New'n'Tasty</em></span>. In this screenshot, you can see the characters are constricted to a platform, with various levels (depths) of environmental assets visible in the background. When designing for 2.5D games, only a portion of the environmental assets are seen, as if you walked into a room and that is it, you can walk no further.</p><p>There are different practices and approaches to modeling assets for games like this, so I encourage you to explore them if 2.5D is something that piques your interest. Some other great examples of 2.5D games are <span class="emphasis"><em>Little Big Planet</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Trine</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bastion</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Raymond Origins</em></span>.<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/154ffa76-b9eb-474e-809a-6a3b84480c11.jpg" /></div><p>Screenshot of New'n'Tasty</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec9"></a>Full 2D</h4></div></div></div><p>Games that are restricted to the x and y-axis (and don't show any depth) are what we call 2D games, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Pac Man</em></span> (featured next). They can be top-down or side-scrolling (up/down/left/right). Unlike 3D games, players only see one side of the game object at any given moment. Sometimes this can be quite linear in the sense that there is no perception of depth (with the exclusion of parallax).</p><p>Often though, sprites can be brought to life, as can the environment, with beautiful (frame-by-frame) animations and effects. Other popular examples of 2D games are <span class="emphasis"><em>Mario</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Donkey Kong</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mark of the Ninja</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/b647db6a-5895-49d3-990a-351bab585bfb.png" /></div><p>Screenshot of Pac Man</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec10"></a>2D with a perspective camera</h4></div></div></div><p>Like 2.5D games, 2D games can also utilize "depth" by using a perspective camera or utilizing a concept known as <span class="strong"><strong>parallax</strong></span>, while not having any 3D assets within the environment. To understand the concept of the parallax effect at a more scientific level, let us look at the following diagram:</p><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/d0cfc1d6-ddfb-4f56-b77d-4a8b7980f3c5.jpg" /></div><p>Depending on where you are, certain items are in view instead of others. If a player is at <span class="strong"><strong>viewpoint 1</strong></span>, then they will see the black circle and blue hexagon; if they are at <span class="strong"><strong>viewpoint 2</strong></span> then they will see the black circle and a red hexagon. Moreover, you can also think of it like this as well, when you move within a game space, the "background" that is closest to you moves faster than the "background" that is further away. It is the same when you're driving in an area, such as the country, and you can see the mountains moving slower than the fence. There are many games that use 2D with a perspective camera/parallax effect, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Braid</em></span> (featured next).</p><p>Other great examples of 2D games that feature parallax environments include <span class="emphasis"><em>Terraria</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Limbo.</em></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/5141be1b-6e1b-491e-8f16-94b0c0f96219.jpg" /></div></div></div></div>
