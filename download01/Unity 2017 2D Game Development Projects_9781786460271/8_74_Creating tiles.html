Just like tiles within your house, combining tiles together can create patterns, and those patterns, within a game's context, can result in its levels. In this chapter, we will learn just how we can use tiles in a third-party program called Tiled, and how to then take the levels that we build and import them into Unity using the program <code class="literal">Tiled2Unity</code>. These are discussed more in just a moment.</p><p>Like the other games in this book, you can find the graphics package for this by visiting the following link:<a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com/product/retroformer/" target="_blank">http://player26.com/product/retroformer/</a>.</p></div>
