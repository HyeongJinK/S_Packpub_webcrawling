If you have been following this book chapter-by-chapter, you will have developed a strong foundation for using Unity. This chapter is an important one because it will explain one of the most crucial and difficult elements to get right when it comes to a game's experience. That is the user's interface, or simply, the UI. Don't let the title fool you; while it may be tempting to think of a UI as something trivial, simply on-screen graphics to convey information, there are many aspects of a UI that can cause problems (for example, navigation). We will discuss all of this through this chapter and then how to implement a basic UI in our game. </p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The basics of the UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Four types of the UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building the UI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scripting the UI and integrating with the collection systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building a basic map</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Testing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Other things that the reader could consider adding to the game later</li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Know how to implement a basic UI into Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Build a basic game map</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about <span>best practices for testing games</span></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>If you're interested in reading more about UI, Unity has some official documentation that explains many aspects in more detail.
