Over many decades, as games have developed along with the technologies that make them available, the context of their uses has also evolved. For example, most games are created to entertain us (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></span>). That is, there is no underlying intention, such as to supplement/support curriculum material or teach us about science (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Ludwig</em></span>) all the way to <span>operational health and safety</span>. Finally, there are games that have been developed for entertainment but have ended up being used for more intuitive reasons. This is because of the educational potential that they afford (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Minecraft and Sid Meier's Civilization series</em></span>) some games that have been created for entertainment purposes have provided ways for students to learn and practice various topics. Lastly, there are game-like experiences or "gamified" experiences that apply game design principles to achieve everyday tasks, from becoming more productive at work, eating better and maintaining a healthier lifestyle, to managing finances and developing new skills (for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Habitica</em></span>).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note4"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to learn all about gamification in Unity, I encourage you to have a look at Gamification with Unity 5.x.
