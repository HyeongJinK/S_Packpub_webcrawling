Then, we moved onto describing how to export the game, with a particular focus on Android builds. We have covered many of the basic topics when it comes to learning about 2D game development in Unity.Â Congratulations!</p><p>If there is one important thing that you should continue to do on your journey as a game developer, it is to never stop learning. Technology changes so quickly, and therefore software and hardware are always advancing and quickly becoming obsolete. In saying that, to stay above and beyond and to ensure that your skills today are as strong as those needed for tomorrow, never stop learning.</p></div>
