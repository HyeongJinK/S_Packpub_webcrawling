BUT! Before we move on, it's important to note that we will use the built-in physics engine in Unity. Since this book teaches by example, we will only cover it briefly and by creating our game. If you want to have a nice in-depth explanation of the Physics engine in Unity, you can refer to <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Freeze! Creating an Intergalactic Shooter</em></span>, of Getting Started with Unity 5.x 2D Game Development (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/getting-started-unity-5x-2d-game-development" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/getting-started-unity-5x-2d-game-development</a>).
