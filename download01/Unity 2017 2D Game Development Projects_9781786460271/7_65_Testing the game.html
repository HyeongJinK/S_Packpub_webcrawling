For instance, there is neither audio nor background music! Now, if you remember the content that we covered in the last chapter, you can definitely implement it. If not, I suggest going through the steps again to learn how.</p><p>Another thing that you might see is that your player is shooting too fast, or moves too slowly. In other instances, enemies might be too challenging, extremely fast, and so on. As a result, you should revise all the variables you exposed in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, and try to tweak them in such a way that the game becomes balanced.</p><p>In any case, you might end up discovering that the game is too simple to be fun; then, you can try to do the exercises in the next section, or draw some new ideas on how to develop your game further.</p></div>
