Have a look at this portion of the environment now: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/5128e27e-8178-4aab-a4ce-e30f68948033.png" /></div><p>Thus, we need to bring decorative props into it! Thankfully, our package comes with great props, such as trees.</p><p>If you didn't, slice them with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong>, to have all of them on different sprites. Then, drag them into the world and fill it as per your taste. Just remember to set the right <strong class="userinput"><code>Sorting Layers</code></strong> for it. In my case, I would go for a <strong class="userinput"><code>Sorting Layer</code></strong> of <strong class="userinput"><code>0</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>-1</code></strong> to be aligned with the terrain or behind it so the character will pass over it. In case you want to create an obstacle or a collectable, you can place it to a higher <strong class="userinput"><code>Sorting Layer</code></strong>, such as <strong class="userinput"><code>2</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>3</code></strong>. However, you need to remember to add a collider for it (and set isTrigger to true in the case of collectable, along with an appropriate script).</p><p>Here is one possible result in arranging props in the level:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/46c81424-deae-44c8-887a-189d2ced9c51.png" /></div><p>Finally, don't forget to share your creation, and to use your imagination and add props designed and drawn by you. Also, don't forget to add a nice background as well. You can find one in the graphics package you have downloaded.</p></div>
