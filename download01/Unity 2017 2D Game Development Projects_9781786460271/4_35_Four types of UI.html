Some UIs are not fixed on the screen, but actually, have a physical space within the game environment.Â In saying this, there are four types of interfaces are diegetic, non-diegetic, meta, and spatial. Each of these has its own specific use and effect when it comes to the player's experience and some are implicit (for example, static graphics) while others are explicit (blood and dirt on the screen). However, these types can be intermixed to create some interesting interfaces and player experiences. For <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span>, we will implement a simple non-diegetic UI, which will show all of the information the player needs to play the game.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec47"></a>Diegetic</h3></div></div></div><p>Diegetic UIs differ from to non-diegetic UIs because they exist in the game world instead of being on top of it and/or completely removed from the game's fiction. Diegetic UIs within the game world can be seen and heard by other players. Some examples of diegetic UI include the screens on computers, ticking clocks, remaining ammunition, and countdowns. To illustrate this, if you have a look at the following image from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tribes Ascend</em></span> game, you can see the amount of ammunition remaining:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/2d07e4f1-06e1-4443-a1f5-6d33cf0a5fc2.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec48"></a>Non-diegetic</h3></div></div></div><p>Non-diegetic interfaces are ones that are rendered outside of the game world and are only visible to the player. They are your typical game UIs that overlay on top of the game. They are completely removed from the game's fiction. Some common uses of non-diegetic UIs can represent health and mana via a colored bar. Non-diegetic UIs are normally represented in 2D, like in the following screenshot of <span class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek Online</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/e602bc16-fc4d-480d-83cb-0704c53143f2.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec49"></a>Spatial</h3></div></div></div><p>Spatial UI elements are physically presented in the game's space. These types of UIs may or not may be visible to the other players within the game space. This is something that is particularly featured in <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Reality</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VR</strong></span>) experiences. Spatial UIs are effective when you want to guide players through a level or to indicate points of interest. The following example is from <span class="emphasis"><em>Army of Two</em></span>. On the ground, you can see arrows directing the player where to go next. You can find out more about implementing Spatial UIs, like the one in the following screenshot, in Unity by visiting the link to the official d<span>ocumentation at</span><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/user-interfaces-vr" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/user-interfaces-vr</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/39fdb26d-e2ed-4981-9940-1ac246a261eb.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec50"></a>Meta</h3></div></div></div><p>Lastly, Meta UIs can exist in the game world but aren't necessarily visualized like they would be as Spatial UIs. This means that they may not be represented within the 3D Space. In most cases, Meta UIs represent an effect of various actions such as getting shot or requiring more oxygen. As you can see in the following image of <span class="emphasis"><em>Metro 2033</em></span>, when the player is in an area that is not suitable for them, the view through the mask begins to get hazy. When they get shot or engage in combat, their mask also receives damage. You can see this through the cracks that appear on the edges of the mask:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/013c8c5c-7bf7-45c3-8e8d-75533030d85d.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"></a>Note</h3><p>So that you become more familiar with the different types of UIs and their uses, try to identify them in the games that you play and see how they aid or complicate a player's navigation.</p></div></div></div>
