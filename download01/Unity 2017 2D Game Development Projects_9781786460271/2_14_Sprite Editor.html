The latter is more effective for many reasons, such as saving computational resources and keeping things organized. A case in which you are likely to combine many Sprites into one Texture may be frame-by-frame animations of a character, where other Sprites may be parts of a character (such as clothing and items), and will need to be customizable, such as different items (and their effects). In Unity, you can easily extract elements from a single Texture by using the Sprite Editor. The Sprite Editor is used to take multiple elements from an Atlas or Sprite Sheet and slice them into individual Sprites.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"></a>How to use the Sprite Editor</h3></div></div></div><p>To open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong>, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Drag and drop some images (anything you have on your computer, so you can have them as test images) into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel.</li><li>Select the 2D image you want to edit from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> view.</li><li>In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Texture Type</code></strong> into <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite (2D and UI)</code></strong>, so you will be able to use it within the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong>.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> button in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Texture Import Inspector</code></strong> and the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> displays.<span class="strong"><strong></strong></span>When you open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> window, you can move it around like any other window within Unity; you can also dock next to others such as the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> windows.</li><li>To select the <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Sprites</code></strong></strong></span>, simply click and drag on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> that you wish to select. As a result, you will have bounding boxes around each <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> element that you have selected, as in the following screenshot:
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/6736cbd9-596f-40b9-82dd-48910057adb9.png" /></div></li><li>If you happen to click and drag too much around a <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong></strong></span>, don't panic! You can easily resize the bounding box by clicking on any of the four corners or edges of the bounding box, like in the upcoming screenshot. Alternatively, you can also reposition the bounding box by clicking and dragging in the middle of the box itself.</li><li>While you're creating these selections, it is important to make sure that you name them appropriately. To do this, click on the box surrounding the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> that you wish to name. You will notice that a box appears.</li><li>Now, next to where it says <strong class="userinput"><code>Name</code></strong> is where you enter the name that you wish to call your Sprite.</li></ol></div><p>Another thing that is also to keep in mind here is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Pivot</code></strong> of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong>. Think of this as the Sprite's center. For example, if you rotate a Sprite, it will rotate wherever its <strong class="userinput"><code>Pivot</code></strong> is <strong class="userinput"><code>.0</code></strong>.</p><p>A few more elements that you will also find useful while you are slicing up your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprites</code></strong> are the options located at the top of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> window. We will discuss them now.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"></a>Note</h3><p>You can only see the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> button if the <strong class="userinput"><code>TextureType</code></strong> on the image you have selected is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> (2D and UI).
In addition, you cannot edit a Sprite which is in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view.</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Slice Menu</strong></span>: <span>One great feature of</span> Unity is the opportunity to automatically slice Sprites. What this means is that if you have a large Sprite sheet with various animations, images, and so on, you can automatically cut each image out. You have two options to do this:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Automatic</code></strong>: Automatic is better for when you have unevenly distributed Sprites, such as the case with an Atlas.  When choosing the location of the Pivot, it will, by default set it to the center.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><strong class="userinput"><code>Method:</code></strong> Method tells you how to deal with existing Sprites within the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Editor</code></strong> window.

An example of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Grid</code></strong> menu is shown in the following screenshot. <strong class="userinput"><code>Pixel Size</code></strong> sets the size of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Grid</code></strong> in the unit of <strong class="userinput"><code>Pixels</code></strong><span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span> This number will be determined based on the size of your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Sheet</code></strong> and distribution of Sprites:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/dafecb90-70e0-4e02-97e6-1f5bf9464dad.png" /></div></div></div>
