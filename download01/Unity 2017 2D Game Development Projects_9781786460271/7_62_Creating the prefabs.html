This small section will guide you through, but I invite you to try to do this by yourself. In fact, we did the bullet prefab, but you should do it also for the player, the different types of enemies, and the decorations we have seen in the previous section.</p><p>For both the player and the enemies, remember to attach <code class="literal">Collider2D</code> and <code class="literal">Rigidbody2D</code>. As we did for the bullet, we need to zero <code class="literal">Gravity Scale</code> on <code class="literal">Rigidbody2D</code>, but you can leave <code class="literal">isTrigger</code> unchecked on the collider. Also, remember to adjust the z coordinate or the ordering layer to make them always appear in the foreground. Needless to say, remember to attach the respective scripts to each one of them and set their values. Pay particular attention to the <code class="literal">BoundX</code> variable, which should be tweaked depending on the map you built.</p><p>As far as decoration elements are concerned, you just need to attach the scripts, and parenting satellites, and make sure they are always shown in the background.</p></div>
