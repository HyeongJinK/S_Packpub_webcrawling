The game is now finished and it's time to export. Unlike the other chapters, we'll also cover how to export the game to mobile devices such as iOS and Android. You can use the same approach for the other games, should you also wish to export them to mobile devices. In addition, we’ll also cover some best practices for exporting to mobile devices. However, keep in mind that we didn't rearrange the input to work on a mobile device. In that case, it's better if you refer to a specific book about mobile game development.</p><p>For a standalone build, if you want to build your game as an executable to run on a PC or Mac, Unity offers a simple process to do so:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings</code></strong>.

There are a few additional things that we will need to download and do before we can be completely ready to export anything from Unity to use on an Android device. We will cover what these things are, how to set them up, and how you can then export the projects in this book for Android (and later iOS) devices:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>To begin, we first need to download and install Android Studio by visiting the following link: <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html. </a>This is a pretty straightforward process, so for now, just follow the installation wizard and make sure that you install it in an ideal location (for example, the programs folder).</li><li>Next, make sure that you have enabled developer options on your Android device. The location of this setting may vary depending on the phone, so if you can't locate it, please consult your phone's manual. In general, you will be able to locate it here: <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>About phone</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build number</code></strong>. In the developer options, you will also find the <strong class="userinput"><code>Install from Unknown sources</code></strong> option, which allows you to install your exported game for testing . We will discuss this later in the chapter<span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span></em></span></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note46"></a>Note</h3><p>Here is an example of this process on a specific device: the Galaxy S7. 
You need to navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>About phone</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Software info</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build number</code></strong>. Tap several times on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build number</code></strong> list item until there is a popup that tells you that the developer mode has been successfully unlocked.
Usually, after having enabled the developer options, they will show up in the top-level menu of the settings dialog as a list menu item.
Open the developer options and simply enable the first switch to permanently enable developer mode. Confirm the popup <strong class="userinput"><code>Use development settings</code></strong> with <strong class="userinput"><code>OK</code></strong> and close the settings menu.</p></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Configure the Android SDK path in Unity.</li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"></a>Note</h3><p>If you want to create a Google Play account so that you can publish your games and applications on the Google Play store, you can do so by visiting the following link: <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/.</a>

You can find this by navigating to the top menu: <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Build Settings</code></strong> or via the keyboard shortcut <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> (or command + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> on a Mac).</li><li>Highlight <strong class="userinput"><code>Android</code></strong> from the list of platforms on the left.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">You will see, if you haven't already (as in the following image), that you need to install the <span class="emphasis"><em>Android Module for Unity</em></span> (~116mb).

After you have done this, you will see the following screen with an array of different options for building on an Android device:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/456d460f-ea27-4b20-9319-70a263359ce1.png" /></div><p></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Then, you need to click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player Settings…</code></strong> button. You will have in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> all the settings to export your game and to build it on a specific platform. You can set the name of your company, and the name of the game, as well as an icon. In particular, if you select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Android tab, you will have four sub-tabs, as shown in the following screenshot:</code></strong></li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/3ee6d5ab-b2ae-4a7c-aacc-b50c2467cc26.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>If you open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Other Settings</code></strong> tab, you will have many options. The most important ones, at least to have a successful build, are under the <strong class="userinput"><code>Identification</code></strong> label. These settings allow you to uniquely identify your game and set the requirements to make it run. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Package Name</code></strong> should be in the form <code class="literal">com.YourCompany.YourGameName</code>, a unique identifier. Be sure to change it before you do any builds:</li></ol></div><p></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/03d801c7-664c-4a58-8398-8a092405301f.png" /></div><p>The other options under <strong class="userinput"><code>Identification</code></strong> are pretty straightforward. Remember that it is important to change and/or update the version of your game every time you publish an update.</p><p>After you have finished that, you can come back to the build menu. If you click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Switch Platform</code></strong> button, the Unity Logo will move next to <strong class="userinput"><code>Android</code></strong>, as shown in the screenshot. Keep in mind that the process might take several minutes, depending on the size of your project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/6b13b86e-d64f-4ff4-9391-88d58ebfe0ef.png" /></div><p>Finally, you will need to add scenes into the build by dragging and dropping them to the preceding space. In the following screenshot, I'll insert <strong class="userinput"><code>Level1</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Level2</code></strong> (which I created):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/b5057638-615c-48ab-b499-5352b1346762.png" /></div><p>One last thing before we export the game. We need to decide if this is a <strong class="userinput"><code>Development Build</code></strong> or not. Since our game has just two levels, and we want to add more to it before we release it, we can check the <strong class="userinput"><code>Development Build</code></strong> checkbox. This way, not only will the <strong class="userinput"><code>Development Build</code></strong> appear, but you will have access to a series of debug tools (outside of the scope of this book) that were otherwise not available. In fact, once checked, you will have another three checkboxes for these debug tools:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/a866654c-3e17-4147-b525-7ad1563e8e6e.png" /></div><p>Now, you are ready to export by pressing the <strong class="userinput"><code>Build</code></strong> button. Unity will ask you where to export the <code class="literal">.apk</code> file to. Once you do this, you can import it to your phone in any location and install it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note48"></a>Note</h3><p>If this is the first time you've developed for an Android phone, you might want to enable <strong class="userinput"><code>Install from Unknown sources</code></strong> in the developer options on your phone. Modern Android systems might redirect on that option when you try to install a <code class="literal">.apk</code>, such as the game you have just built. However, on older Android systems, you need to enable the developer mode. How to enable it might depend on your phone, but usually, you do it by tapping seven times on the build version in your system info (as explained earlier in the chapter).</p></div></div></div></div>
