We could do this by changing the transform of the character, but since we are using the physics engine of Unity, and we don’t want to force the character to go against a wall ignoring the collisions, we need to find another way.
Thankfully, the <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code> that we created a couple of sections ago, has a built-in function to move the <code class="literal">Rigidbody</code><span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>into a new position and respect the collisions. Exactly what we need! The function is called <code class="literal">MovePosition()</code> and we can use it as shown here:</p><pre class="programlisting">void FixedUpdate () {
        //Get the new position of our character
        var x = transform.position.x + Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * speed;
        var y = transform.position.y + Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * speed;

        //Set the position of our character throught the RigidBody2D component (since we are using 
        physics)
        rigidBody.MovePosition(new Vector2(x, y));
    }</pre><p>And with this, you can save the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code> script, and we have finished with it.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec40"></a>Testing the PlayerController</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we move on, it's best practice to test what we have achieved so far.</p><p>If we Hit play, we can move the character in the world by using the arrows key if you are on a keyboard. If you want to test whether the angel is colliding properly, you can just place a wall, add a <code class="literal">BoxCollider2D</code>, and test it out.</p></div></div>
