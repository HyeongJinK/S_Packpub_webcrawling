For our second project, we will be making a top-down arcade-style shooter that will transport you into the world of galactic fantasies. In this game, you will control a small spacecraft that must navigate around planets and asteroids to collect power stars and health (if you get hit):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/1c31e9c3-ec98-41ef-8bce-b2d67231b7d7.png" /></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec70"></a>Overview of shooting games</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different types of shooting games, each designed differently from the next. To offer you a better understanding of their differences, and to provide you with a bunch of different examples that may inspire your own games, we'll discuss these different types.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec36"></a>First-Person</h4></div></div></div><p>Our first example is perhaps the most common type that people think of when they hear about the "shooter" genre. From a 3D perspective of the player, a <span class="strong"><strong>First-Person Shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>) is all about putting you in the virtual shoes of the game's avatar and seeing the game's world through their eyes. FPSs can be traced back to the 1970s, and since then, they have developed into spectacular and immersive worlds that take us far from our own reality, such as in <span class="emphasis"><em>Metro 2033</em></span>, pictured here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/efd46d41-d976-4f5b-ae47-3dfb33ab3c38.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec37"></a>Third-Person</h4></div></div></div><p>In a literal step back from an FPS, <span class="strong"><strong>Third-Person Shooters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TPS</strong></span>) have you controlling the player from behind or over the shoulder. Like FPSs, TPSs also has a long history that can be traced back to the late 1970s. An excellent example is <span class="emphasis"><em>Spec Ops: The Line</em></span>, pictured here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/85bd36aa-5fc0-48aa-824e-676b738057c8.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec38"></a>Top-down</h4></div></div></div><p>If FPSs are <span class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> the player's shoes and TPSs are from behind, let us talk about shooters where the perspective is from above, or top-down. Think of these types of shooters as played from a birds-eye perspective. Many arcade games feature top-down shooters, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Asteroids</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span> (pictured here):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/43298094-ae6e-49a4-a533-68f796859213.png" /></div><p>As you can see, the style of shooter all depends on the perspective of the camera, at least as far as our examples go. There are many sub-genres of shooters (for example survival, rail, light gun, tactical, and so on). All of these would require a whole chapter or even book to discuss, so I encourage you to explore them to deepen your own knowledge.</p></div></div></div>
