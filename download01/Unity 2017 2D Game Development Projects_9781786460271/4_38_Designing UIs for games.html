Not only will chosing the right UI for your game greatly add value to its ability to convey information it will also help to improve the user's experience. We'll go through the different types of UIs, along with some examples, in the following sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec51"></a>Feedback</h3></div></div></div><p>One thing that a UI can offer is feedback to a player based on their interaction. Feedback can take on many forms and can be something as simple as a meter increasing/decreasing (for example, the health bar) to a player's avatar changing over time as the player upgrades and customizes them. In other instances, entire menus may change to reflect a player's progression through the game, like in <span class="emphasis"><em>Spec Ops: The Line</em></span> in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/6d507742-ef0e-468f-8332-87334e75dab7.png" /></div><p>You want feedback to be instantaneous, but not in the player's face. You want to alert them that a change has occurred based on an interaction but without annoying them. Could you imagine if every time you got a pellet in <span class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span> you got some large sparkly text saying "Well done" or "Good Job<strong class="userinput"><code>"</code></strong> plastered on your screen? Most likely not, and this is why, when you want to highlight a significant form of interaction, such as destroying a level 99 boss, you would adorn the player's screen with these kinds of things. It's a monumental event, let them know that their 1382nd attempt at the level was appreciated. Therefore, how you are going to alert the player to changes in the UI is as important as when.</p><p>When it comes to discrete changes to a UI, you may want to consider a subtle animation of a UI element. This can be as simple as a glow around the UI element. Another option is to use sound. Coming back to <span class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span>, the use of sound was implemented each time a player picked up a pellet. It is important to remember that audio can be just as effective as an animation, though it may not always be heard. For example, sometimes, players opt to disable the sound if they are in public or do not have headphones, others may have hearing impairments, like we discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Make Some Prefabs</em></span>. Therefore, keep this in mind if you are using sound as the only way to indicate a change in the UI to the player. Lastly, you can implement subtle feedback from the starting point of an interaction, such as the main menu. In this way, you have the ability to communicate things such as progress, like that in the (previous)image of <span class="emphasis"><em>Spec Ops: The Line</em></span>. As you progress through the game and complete each chapter, the main menu screen changes from something that is relatively neutral (top-left corner) to a devastating war-torn country (bottom-right corner), which reflects what has occurred in the game. While it is subtle, it in some ways sets the mood for the game and provides a sense of progression to the player before they continue their journey.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec52"></a>Be bold, not ambiguous</h3></div></div></div><p>Be loud but don't shout in the user's face, you want the impact of your UI to be exciting and meaningful and not aesthetic noise.</p><p>Loud noises can immediately get people's attention, and so can UI elements. Therefore, you want to make your more important elements the focal point. The key here is to have fewer elements so that the player doesn't feel overwhelmed. For example, in a game, you may want the health bar to be the main item of focus. Therefore, place it somewhere where it will be noticed and not in the corner in the player's peripheral view. One way to achieve this is to have the UI elements contrast the environment, ideally within the same color palette so that they stand out, but not draw so much attention that they are distracting. A great website to create great color schemes is Adobe Color CC (<a class="ulink" href="https://color.adobe.com/" target="_blank">https://color.adobe.com/</a>). An example of it can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/05153690-459a-42ea-8f27-4fbf97f7079c.png" /></div><p>
Color is a great way to convey information to players for various reasons. Just like a red traffic light means stop and green means go, the same approach can convey something immediately to a player with little effort. A common example of this in games is with a health bar. In general, when it is full, it is green. As the player engages in combat and takes damage, it begins to deplete and turn red, therefore instantly telling the player they're at risk of dying.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"></a>Note</h3><p>
Just like we have seen with audio, similar considerations need to be made with color. UI design and feedback shouldn't rely on color alone. This is because some players may have some degree of colorblindness.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec53"></a>Keep it simple, consistent, and focused</h3></div></div></div><p>When it comes to the components of a UI, they should be presented or highlighted in the order that you want your player to focus on. In other words, keep the important stuff on top and visible, with non-important elements not demanding visual real estate. Think of this as a visual hierarchy, from most important to least important. A simple example of this is to make a UI component bigger to make it the focal point. In this way, it cannot be ignored by a player: something that is useful for indicating a player's depleting life.
In saying that, the use of consistent color is important to maintain. For example, if you use one color to represent coins, try to avoid using it for other similar items (for example, gems or other resources). If the colors of items are too similar, then the player is going to have a hard time distinguishing between them, especially during moments that require fast interactions. You don’t want players going crazy to collect coins thinking that they are super valuable gems, only to be bitterly disappointed when they check their inventory. It does happen.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec54"></a>Ergonomics: devices, hardware, and gestures</h3></div></div></div><p>Phones and tablets don't have mice, so clicking options vary. This is an important thing to keep in mind because not all devices are created equally. When it comes to touchscreens, there is two kinds—capacitive and resistive touch. Capacitive is what you will experience with most modern devices, and you interact with the screen simply by touching it. Resistive, on the other hand, requires that a certain level of pressure is applied, such as with a stylus.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec55"></a>Multi-device design</h3></div></div></div><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that if you are designing for multiple devices, try to keep the experience the same. With many applications being multi-platform, you don't want the user getting used to an experience on a cellphone that is presented in one way, and then to log on to the computer version, and it's completely different. Therefore, while you are designing the UI, determine how it will look on each device. Is the home icon too small on a cell phone to understand what it is? Is the navigation menu too large for a desktop version? Making sure that the UI is optimized will ensure that users who use your application across multiple devices will have a seamless transition and won't have to try to figure out how to access the features all over again.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec56"></a>Meaning and integrity</h3></div></div></div><p>When it comes to creating a meaningful UI, you don't want to have unnecessary or deceptive interactions. What I mean by this is that you don't want players clicking a trophy button and then it takes them to a purchase page for coins, gems, or other virtual currency. Buttons aren't and shouldn't be used as click bait, even if things such as microtransactions are part of your business model.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec57"></a>Goals</h3></div></div></div><p>You want to make sure that your goals are met with the UI that is presented to the player. If you want the player to follow a certain navigational path to encourage communication and the sharing of resources among players, you want the way that it is meant to be done presented in a clear and concise way.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec58"></a>Enjoyment</h3></div></div></div><p>No one likes navigating through five menus to do one thing, nor do they want to keep track of necessary components (for example,  health or remaining ammunition) by having to look at different locations on the screen. You want the UI to be as natural as possible so that it doesn’t interfere but also so that it can be enjoyed and utilized by players.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec59"></a>Test</h3></div></div></div><p>It goes without saying, and if I haven't said it enough, I will say it again, test, and test on multiple devices. The UI may look incredible on a PC, but if it's all shrunk up on a smaller-than-average smartphone, that isn't going to be fun. Even though you should be thinking about this from the beginning, in terms of screen resolution, devices sometimes give us unexpected surprises.</p></div></div>
