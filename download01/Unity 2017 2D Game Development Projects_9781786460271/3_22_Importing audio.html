We will cover the basics of what you need to know in the following sections.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"></a>Audio Listener</h3></div></div></div><p>Have you heard the saying,<span class="emphasis"><em> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it still make a sound?</em></span> Well, in Unity, if there is nothing to hear your audio, then the answer is no. This is because Unity has a component called an <span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>Listener,</strong></span> which works like a microphone<span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span> To locate the Audio Listener, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong>, and then look over at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>; it should be located near the bottom, like in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/880b5993-e92b-4b99-8639-7d50075e5a3c.png" /></div><p>If for some reason, it isn't there, you can always add it by clicking the following button titled <strong class="userinput"><code>Add Component</code></strong>, type <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Listener</code></strong>, and select it (click it) from the list, like in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/b90f0dad-35c6-4b8a-a36a-546c1ca4946c.png" /></div><p>The important thing to remember is that an <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Listener</code></strong> is the location of the sound, so it makes sense as to why it is typically placed on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Main Camera</code></strong>, but it can also be placed on a Player. A single scene can only have one <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Listener</code></strong>; therefore, it's best to experiment with the one that works best for your game.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"></a>Note</h3><p><span>It is important</span> to remember that an <strong class="userinput"><code>Audio Listener</code></strong> works with an Audio Source, and must have one to work.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"></a>Audio Source</h3></div></div></div><p>The Audio Source is where the sound comes from. This can be from many different objects within a Scene as well as background and sound FX. The Audio Source has several parameters; later we will briefly discuss the main ones.</p><p>To see more information about all the parameters, you can check out the official Unity documentation by visiting the link or scanning the QR code:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.2/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioSource.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.2/Documentation/Manual/class-AudioSource.html</a></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/cb690d22-649f-4693-b65a-654b652bd605.png" /></div><p></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note22"></a>Note</h3><p>You may be wondering why we should have a slider for <span class="strong"><strong>Spatial Blend</strong></span>, instead of a checkbox. This is because we need to fade between 2D and 3D, and there is a good reason for this. Imagine that you're in a game and you're looking at a screen on a computer. In this case, your camera is going to be fixated on whatever is on the screen. This could be checking an inventory or even entering nuclear codes. In any case, you will want the sound that is being emitted from the screen to be the focal audio. Therefore, the slider in the Spatial Blend parameter is going to be closer to 2D. This is because you may still want ambient noises that are in the background incorporated into the experience. So, if you are closer to 2D, the sound will be the same in both speakers (or headphones). The closer you slide toward 3D, the more the volume will depend on the proximity of the Sound Listener to the Sound Source. It will also allow for things, such as the Doppler Effect, to be more noticeable, as it takes in 3D space. There are also specific settings for these things.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"></a>Choosing sounds for background and FX</h3></div></div></div><p>When it comes to picking the right kind of music for your game, just like the aesthetics, you need to think about what kind of "mood" you're trying to create. Is it a sombre or uplifting kind of mood, are you ironically contrasting the graphics (for example, happy) with gloomy music? There is really no right or wrong when it comes to your musical selection if you can communicate to the player what they are supposed to feel, at least in general.</p><p>For this game, I have provided you with some example "moods" that you can apply to this game. Of course, you're welcome to choose sounds other than this that are more to your liking! All the sounds that we will use will be from the Free Sound website: <a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org" target="_blank">https://freesound.org</a>. You will need to create an account to download them, but it's free and there are many great sounds that you can use when creating games. In saying this, if you're intending to create your games for commercial purposes, please make sure that you check the Terms and Conditions on Free Sound to make sure that you're not violating any of them. Each track will have its own attribution licenses, including those for commercial use, so always check! For this project, we're going to stick with the "Happy" version. But I encourage you to experiment!</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec33"></a>Happy</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting Angel Cakes</strong></span>: Chime sound (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/jgreer/sounds/333629/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/jgreer/sounds/333629/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Being attacked by the enemy</strong></span>: <code class="literal">Cat Purr/Twit4.wav</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/steffcaffrey/sounds/262309/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/steffcaffrey/sounds/262309/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting health:</strong></span> correct (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/ertfelda/sounds/243701/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/ertfelda/sounds/243701/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting bonuses:</strong></span> Signal-Ring 1 (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/Vendarro/sounds/399315/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/Vendarro/sounds/399315/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Background:</strong></span> <code class="literal">Kirmes_Orgel_004_2_Rosamunde.mp3</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/bilwiss/sounds/24720/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/bilwiss/sounds/24720/</a>)</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec34"></a>Sad</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting Angel Cakes:</strong></span> Glass Tap (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/Unicornaphobist/sounds/262958/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/Unicornaphobist/sounds/262958/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Being attacked by the enemy:</strong></span> <code class="literal">musicbox1.wav</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/sandocho/sounds/17700/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/sandocho/sounds/17700/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting health:</strong></span> <code class="literal">chime.wav</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/Psykoosiossi/sounds/398661/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/Psykoosiossi/sounds/398661/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting <span>bonuses</span>:</strong></span> short metallic hit (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/waveplay/sounds/366400/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/waveplay/sounds/366400/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Background:</strong></span> improvised chill 8 (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/waveplay/sounds/238529/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/waveplay/sounds/238529/</a>)</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec35"></a>Retro</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting Angel Cakes:</strong></span> <code class="literal">TF_Buzz.flac</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/copyc4t/sounds/235652/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/copyc4t/sounds/235652/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Being attacked by the enemy:</strong></span> Game Die (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/364929/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/364929/</a>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Collecting health:</strong></span> <code class="literal">galanghee.wav</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://freesound.org/people/metamorphmuses/sounds/91387/" target="_blank">https://freesound.org/people/metamorphmuses/sounds/91387/</a>)

While subtitles can enable dialogue to be more accessible, sound FX can be a little trickier. Therefore, when it comes to implementing audio, think about how you could complement it, even if the same effect that you're trying to achieve with sound is subtle. For example, if you play a "bleep" for every item collected, perhaps you could associate it with a slight glow or flash of color. The choice is up to you, but it's something to keep in mind. On the other end of the spectrum, those who can hear might also want to turn the sounds off. We've all played that game (or several) that really begins to become irritating, so make sure that you also check this while you're playtesting. You don't want an awesome game to suck because your audio is intolerable and there is not an option to TURN THE SOUND OFF! You’ve been warned.</p></div></div></div>
