<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec68"></a>Exercises</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Like we did in the previous chapter, here is a series of exercises you can do to not only improve your skills but also improve the overall quality of the game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">As anticipated in the previous section, audio is missing in this game. But, since you learned how to implement it when working with <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span>, here is your chance to test what you have learned.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">For the lives counter, the player can have a maximum of three lives because there are only three hearts. You can increase the number of hearts, but they would fill the UI up quickly. So, what about having a number next to the first heart in case the player has more than three lives? In this way, from zero to three lives the player has a visual feedback, and if the player has more than four lives they are represented by a number. Modify the <code class="literal">LivesCounter</code> script to include this modification.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Alternatively, if you don't like the idea of giving the player more than three lives, you should still consider rewarding the player for collecting a heart. So, you can modify <code class="literal">LivesCounter</code> so that in the event that a life is added, but the player already has the maximum amount of lives, then the player's score is increased by five.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Now that you have enough knowledge of the UI, you can improve the overall look, maybe by integrating your own graphics. For instance, try to head for something that looks like the following:
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/f2c5d186-e342-4420-a766-4c84dc75832c.png" /></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">In the spawning system, we have two coroutines. As anticipated, you can merge them to create a unique coroutine with parameters. As a result, you will be able to launch the same coroutine twice in the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function, just with different parameters (<span>such as which array is taking the object to spawn</span>).</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Our spawning system is great, but it doesn't take into consideration power-ups! Although you can place power-ups in the <code class="literal">decorations</code> array, you might want to implement another coroutine (or launch the same coroutine with different parameters if you did the previous exercises), to spawn power-ups as well.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The spawning system works, especially after the previous two exercise, but it can be improved. What about spawning two enemies at the same time once in a while? Or even spawning a special unit such as a boss? Try modifying the spawning system.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Our game has many decorations, a couple of power-ups, and enemies. Use your imagination, creativity, and skill to create more. Maybe create different levels, and design your own characters or backgrounds. Take inspiration from the next section, and make the most out of your game!
