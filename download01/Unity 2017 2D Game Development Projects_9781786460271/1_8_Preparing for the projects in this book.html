Each project will build on the skills learned in the previous one. In this way, you will not only be consolidating your own skills but also adapting them to different situations—a versatile skill for anyone who truly wants to grasp game design. All the assets that we will be using are free and links will be provided to you to download all the content for each game. Here, I have included a brief description of each of these projects to give you an idea of what we will be tackling throughout the rest of this book.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"></a>Project 1 - Angel Cakes</h3></div></div></div><p>Our first project is titled <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span> and as you can guess there are an <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel </em></span>and <span class="emphasis"><em>Cake. </em></span>In this game, you will control a little angel that will navigate around the environment. Similar to <span class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span>, you will also collect little cakes in order to progress to harder and more challenging levels. There will be enemies, power-ups, and health should you need to collect it. Think of this game as an intro to the basics of setting up a 2D Unity game project.  </p><p>You can download the asset package for Angel Cakes here: <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com/product/angelcakes/" target="_blank">http://player26.com/product/angelcakes/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"></a>Project 2 - intergalactic shooter: Quark</h3></div></div></div><p>Our second project will be a simple intergalactic shooter that will have us controlling a small spaceship shooting at nearby planets and enemies to score as high as possible within the time limit. It is quite arcade-like and very basic, but it will draw upon the skills that you learned from <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span> while also extending on them to create more complex interaction.  </p><p>You can download the asset package for <span class="emphasis"><em>Quark</em></span> here: <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com/product/quark/" target="_blank">http://player26.com/product/quark/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"></a>Project 3 - RETROformer</h3></div></div></div><p>Our third and final game will be a platformer game titled <span class="emphasis"><em>RETROformer</em></span>. In this final game, the player can collect coins, shoot enemies, and explore the environment. Essentially, this project will combine everything that you have learned previously with <span class="emphasis"><em>Angel Cakes</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Quark</em></span>, and build upon it. By the end of the project, you will have developed a strong understanding of what is involved in making games in different genres with different game elements and mechanics. </p><p>You can download the asset package for <span class="emphasis"><em>RETROformer</em></span> here: <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com/product/retroformer/" target="_blank">http://player26.com/product/retroformer/</a></p></div></div>
