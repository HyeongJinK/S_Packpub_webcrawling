There are many examples of these types of games in both 2D and 3D, and to give you some examples and inspiration for your own games, here is a brief overview.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"></a>Key features of collecting in games and things to keep in mind</h3></div></div></div><p>Like we have seen with the preceding examples, it goes without saying that the key feature of a collecting game is, well... collecting something. This could be coins or items; such things may also be used to represent other elements, such as collecting hearts for health. The core mechanic is that the player must collect something to meet a certain condition, such as gaining lives, leveling up, or progressing. There are various other components and parameters that you can implement into a collecting game, such as enemies, the value of items, the frequency of rare items, and so forth. In this way, it is not only about what the player is collecting, but you as a game designer must also define how, when, and how often the player is able to collect the items.</p><p>There isn't much that can go wrong when it comes to creating a collecting game per se. Ideally, you want the game to be balanced and challenging. This becomes an issue when it is time to assign points to various of parameters. The right number that you should assign to these will be refined through playtesting, so don't be too worried if they aren't right in the beginning. To get a better understanding of how games focused on collecting are balanced, I encourage you to play any of the preceding games if you can access them or watch some playthroughs on YouTube.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"></a>What will you learn in the remainder of this chapter?</h3></div></div></div><p>By now, you should have a better understanding of games that focus on collecting items. Now we're going to create our own. Of course, you're welcome to use your own graphics and images, but for this tutorial, you are welcome to download the free asset pack online. We'll cover this later in this chapter.</p></div></div>
