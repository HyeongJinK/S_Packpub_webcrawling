You are at the beginning of your journey into the world of 2D game development. Throughout this book, we will explore many things that the world of 2D games can offer and how to design exciting adventures. This book not only explains what to do in Unity but also what is involved in the game design process. In this way, you will have a solid foundation in game design and development.</p><p>In some instances throughout this chapter and the rest of the book, there are various links to resources (such as Unity documentation). In many of these instances, both the link and a QR code are provided. The intention here is to save time entering the URL into your browser if you are reading a hard copy of this book. Now with that said, this is what we will cover in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Game design</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The game design process</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Developing 2D games</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Unity Engine</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating new projects in Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Preparing for the projects in this book</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Key tips and best practices for 2D (and general) game development</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Additional game design exercises to develop your skills as a game designer</li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you will have achieved the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Have a general understanding of game design and the processes involved in making a game</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Know how to download and set up Unity
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Know how to configure Unity for a 2D game project</li></ul></div><p>Now, let's begin our journey.</p><p><span>Game design</span> is an exciting adventure that draws from many different disciplines, such as programming, art, design, audio, and creative writing. This may be overwhelming, especially if you're new to game design. You may think "but I am neither a programmer nor a creative writer, and I can't draw to save my life!" If you have a passion for games, then game design <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> possible. However, it is not for the <span>weary</span>. Game design will challenge you and it will test your patience. However, I promise you that the feeling you get from learning how to make your first character move with text in a script, to having that character collect coins, shoot enemies, and finish a level is an extremely rewarding experience.</p><p>This book does not assume that you know anything about creating games or any of the skills that are associated with game development. Over the course of the book, you will learn the basics of programming in C#, how to create three different types of 2D games in Unity, and a whole lot more about the game design process in general. Fear not about the art or the sound, as we will be using some free asset packages and sounds so that you can create something magical. Of course, if you dare to push yourself, I encourage you to dabble in these areas, as even a basic level of understanding goes a long way. </p></div>
