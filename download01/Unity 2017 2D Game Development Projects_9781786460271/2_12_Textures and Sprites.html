To begin, a Sprite is an image that can be used as a 2D object. It has only two coordinates: x-axis and y-axis. Therefore, all the graphical components of 2D game development are called <span class="strong"><strong>Sprites</strong></span>. Sprites can be repositioned, scaled, and rotated like any other game object in Unity. You can move, destroy, or create it during the game. Sprites, by default, are rendered directly against the camera; however, you can easily change this if you are using the <span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong></span> in a 3D scene. They work with the Sprite Renderer, unlike a 3D object, which works with the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span>. Aside from Sprites, there are other graphical components called <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span>. These are also images, but they are used to change the appearance of an object in both 2D (for example, Sprites and background) and 3D (for example, an object or character's appearance). But Textures are not objects. This means that you cannot get them to move during gameplay. Saying that, you can create images with Textures that animate, with Sprite Sheets/Atlases. What this means is that each frame of an animation is placed on a Sprite Sheet, which is a Texture, that will eventually be cut up so that each frame of the animation is played sequentially. Throughout this book, we will use the terms Sprite Sheets and Atlases. While they are pretty much the same thing, the subtle difference between the two is that a Sprite Sheet generally has Sprite (frame-by-frame) animations, whereas an Atlas will contain images such as tileable Textures for the walls and other environmental components (for example, objects). Their purpose is to maximize the space by combining multiple images into one Texture, whether for characters (and their animations) or environmental Textures.</p><p>More generally speaking, when it comes to handling Sprites and Textures, Unity has various tools that deal with them in different ways and are used for different purposes. A brief overview of each of them follows. We will discuss them in more detail throughout this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Editor</strong></span>: This is used to edit Sprites. This is done by selecting them individually from a larger image, known as a Sprite Atlas, or by changing their Pivot point, and so on.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Creator</strong></span>: This is used to create a Sprite placeholder. This is useful if you do not have any Sprites to use but want to continue implementing the functionality of a game. Sprite placeholders can be replaced later with actual Sprites. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sprite Packer</strong></span>: This is used to <span class="emphasis"><em>increase</em></span> the <span class="emphasis"><em>efficiency</em></span> of your project's usage of main memory. It achieves this by packing various Sprites into a single place using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Packing Tag</code></strong> attribute. This appears in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong> window when you select a Sprite in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> window.</li></ul></div></div>
