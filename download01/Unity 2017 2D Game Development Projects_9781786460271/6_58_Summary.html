But, it gave us the possibility of bringing our game to life. In fact, we first programmed the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>, which is responsible for moving the player's spaceship as well as shooting according to the player's input. Then, we saw how it's possible to automate the process of moving and shooting with just a few lines of code by writing the <code class="literal">EnemyController</code>. Also, we explored a variant in case you would like to use the second, or maybe both at the same time, to create variety among enemies' behaviors. Finally, we implemented our <code class="literal">BulletController</code>, which is responsible for moving the bullet on the map, but also for hitting an enemy or the player, creating an explosion.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch07">Chapter 7</a>,Â <span class="emphasis"><em><span>Getting Serious About Gameplay</span></em></span>, we will explore how to incorporate power-up, score, and health into our game, as <span>well as</span> building the environment for our game, and we will finish up by polishing the game. So, without losing any more time, let's jump to the next chapter.</p></div>
