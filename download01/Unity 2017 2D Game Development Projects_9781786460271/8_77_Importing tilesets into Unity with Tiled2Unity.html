Once you have created your Tilemap in Tiled, we need to bring it into Unity so that the player will be able to interact with it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"></a>Note</h3><p>Generally, most of the things that we have completed using third-party software can be done manually within Unity itself; however, third-party tools offer a way to increase efficiency, and in some cases, the output. In saying that, I do encourage you to explore the ways that you could complete these tasks within Unity, even if they are time-consuming. In the event that such programs are no longer available, it is useful to know the "manual" way to achieve the same results.</p></div><p>When you open Tiled2Unity, you will see a window like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/d3c8fcc2-6fcd-4e5e-b722-fdc4ce316cfd.png" /></div><p>While initially this may be quite daunting, the whole process is very simple. To import our <strong class="userinput"><code>Tilemap</code></strong> from <strong class="userinput"><code>Tiled</code></strong>, simply:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open/create your project Unity (if you haven't already).</li><li>In Tiled2Unity, navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code>Help</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Import Unity Package To Project</code></strong>.</li></ol></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>In Unity, a dialogue box will open. Now, click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Import</code></strong>. An example of this can be seen in the following screenshot. At this stage, all that is happening is <strong class="userinput"><code>Tiled2Unity</code></strong> is setting up the plugin within Unity. As a result, we can then use the <code class="literal">Tilemap</code> files (from <strong class="userinput"><code>Tiled</code></strong>) that we are about to import next:

Keep in mind that this value tells us how long a pixel is in the World Units of Unity. This might take some trial and error, especially when you are working on larger projects. However, once you have found an appropriate value to use, you should keep it consistent throughout your project, unless you have specific needs. In this book, we will go for a value equal to <code class="literal">0.02</code>.</li><li>Next, click <strong class="userinput"><code>Export To…</code></strong> and specify the location within your Unity project. This file should be inside the folder <code class="literal">Assets/Tiled2Unity</code> and called <code class="literal">Tiled2Unity.export</code>.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>If necessary, click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Preview Map</code></strong> to make sure that you have the right Tilemap. You can see an example of this in the following screenshot:

We are now finished with Tiled2Unity, so it's time to head back into Unity to continue making our game, which we will begin in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch09">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Look, It Moves</em></span>.</p></div>
