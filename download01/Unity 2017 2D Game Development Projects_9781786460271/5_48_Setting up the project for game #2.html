We will go through the steps briefly, but if you need a more detailed process, if you have, for instance, chosen to start with this project, then I encourage you to review the previous chapters. Now, with that said, let's get started.</p><p>You can find the assets to this project atÂ <a class="ulink" href="http://player26.com/product/quark/" target="_blank">http://player26.com/product/quark/</a>.</p><p>Once you have downloaded the files, unzip them into the location of your project.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec71"></a>Importing assets for the space shooter</h3></div></div></div><p>As we have already discussed with the first project, there are few differences when it comes to importing the assets for our second game. Like the last project, the assets for this one also come with a series of Sprite Sheets; <span>these look like the following images</span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/74ff7d19-cc4b-458e-8e2a-ce7d2a282561.png" /></div><p><span>As you can</span> see from the image above, we have spaceships, explosions, and planets. Basically, everything we need to create our space-themed shooting game.</p><p>Once you have imported them into Unity, we will need to slice them up and label the Sprites accordingly. You can either follow our naming convention or choose your own. Just remember that if you choose to use your own naming convention when referencing the Sprites, you must also use it within your code, instead of the names we use. The naming convention we will use should be clear, but I invite you to find a naming convention that works for you.</p><p>Remember that the Sprite Sheets should be sliced. In the next section, we are going to slice the Sprite Sheet to make the explosion.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec72"></a>Organizing the project</h3></div></div></div><p>In organizing the project, as we did for the previous game, we need to create a folder to keep everything tidy. In this game, we are going to use the following folders:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Animations</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Audio and Music</code> (you need to fill this one with your own music and sound effects)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Fonts</code> (you need to fill this one with your own fonts)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Graphics</code> (where you need to place all the Sprite Sheets of the graphics package)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Prefabs</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Scripts</code></li></ul></div><p>Here is how your <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel should look:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/7b938f74-f60a-4d50-ab87-15dca8fdef41.png" /></div><p>After this has been set up, let us get our hands dirty, starting with creating a big explosion.</p></div></div>
