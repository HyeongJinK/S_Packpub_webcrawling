Here is a brief overview of the roles that each will play in the development of RETROformer:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Tiled:</strong></span> Where we will create the level environment that the player will navigate through</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Tiled2Unity:</strong></span> Where we will import the level created in Tiled into Unity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Unity:</strong></span> Where we will implement player controls, a save system, various other interactive, decorative (for example, trees, background effects, and so on), and UI elements</li></ul></div><p><span>At this stage you should be used to the file structures for creating games from the last 2.
