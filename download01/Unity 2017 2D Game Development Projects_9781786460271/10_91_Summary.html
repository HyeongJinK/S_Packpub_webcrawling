From here, we added a new layer for properly identifying our ground, and we added a tag for Jump pads. Then, we moved on to building our Panda Hero by setting up all the components required. Next, we moved to exploring how we can create a Movement Component to allow our hero to move, and we designed it in such a way that it is modular. This means that how the input is received to the Movement Component is not important for the movement itself. As such, we have implemented a Player Controller to send input with a keyboard to the Movement Component.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Don't Forget to Save!</em></span>, we will refine even further the Movement Component to implement jump pads, as well as exploring how we can save game data. In addition, you will learn how to script gameplay for this last game, and you will be provided with hints on how to enhance the overall quality of the game. With that said, turn the page!</p></div>
