There are a few things that we need to do before we even open Unity (assuming you haven't downloaded it or used it before). If you have already downloaded Unity and set it up, you can skip the next section: <span class="emphasis"><em>An overview of built-in features in Unity</em></span>; if you haven't please read on.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec7"></a>Downloading Unity</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, let's start getting everything set up to create our games.</p><p>To begin, you can grab your own free copy of Unity by heading to the following URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"></a>Note</h3><p>If you choose to download Unity 2018 Beta, it should not affect anything that you will do in this book. However, it is possible that some things will be slightly different than they are presented here. Please keep this in mind when deciding on which version to download. For this book, we are going to use the latest stable version at the time of writing.</p></div><p>Each plan has its own benefits, some with more added features than others. Depending on your long-term needs, a pro or plus plan might be useful. However, for all the projects in this book, we will be using the personal (free) version of Unity. Once you have chosen the version that suits your needs the most, download and install it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip9"></a>Note</h3><p>While this book aims to teach you the basics of 2D game development, I encourage you to check out these four things (all available on the official website):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Tutorials <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials</a></li><li>Documentation <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.3/Documentation/Manual/" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.3/Documentation/Manual/</a></li><li>Community <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/community" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/community</a></li><li>Social (for example, Twitter, Facebook groups, and so on)</li></ol></div><p>
Not only will you be able to explore a lot of the added 2D (and 3D) options that Unity offers, which aren’t covered here, you can also learn about them through their own tutorials. Lastly, I highly encourage you to become part of the Unity Community and engage with their social media. In this way, you will be able to connect with other Unity game developers while at the same time being up to date with the latest news and be immersed in a great platform for you to share your own projects and questions with other game developers.</p></div><p>Once you have installed Unity, you will be required to log in. If you haven't created an account, don't fret, it's a straightforward process. Simply click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>create one</em></span> link to do it. The process is simple, free, and will take little time to go through. Once you're done, come back and enter your login details, and click <strong class="userinput"><code>Sign In</code></strong>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"></a>Note</h3><p><span>More</span> detailed information can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/unity/activation/personal" target="_blank">https://unity3d.com/unity/activation/personal</a> or by scanning the following QR code.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/eca015c7-a745-46ff-91ab-519802d04d53.png" /></div></div><p>Once you've done this, there will be a short survey about you (basic demographic information) and your intended use of Unity. This is the final step before we will use Unity. When you have submitted the survey response, you will see a screen with three different options: <strong class="userinput"><code>Projects</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Learn</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Activity</code></strong>, like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/4924c649-5371-478c-9179-96a47f6ef00f.png" /></div><p><strong class="userinput"><code>Projects</code></strong> simply show all your current projects that are either found on your computer (<strong class="userinput"><code>On Disk</code></strong>) or online (<strong class="userinput"><code>In the Cloud</code></strong>). However, what I want to draw your attention to is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Learn</code></strong> tab, which is shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/6d593425-b457-4040-8c7e-377656eae41d.png" /></div><p>There are several types of tutorials that you can explore at your own pace, like the ones in this book, which will teach you some interesting things about Unity. You will need to download each tutorial to go through it and depending on your connection, it may take a little to no time. Here is an example of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Survival shooter tutorial</code></strong>, along with the instructions within the browser (left):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/597986c8-538d-4ff1-8100-2f3ea3027470.png" /></div><p>(left) The Survival Shooter tutorial that Unity offers.
