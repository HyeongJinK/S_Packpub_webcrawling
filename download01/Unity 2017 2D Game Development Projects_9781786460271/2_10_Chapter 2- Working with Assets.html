In a way, you can think of this as leveling up as you begin to progress through the book. Give yourself a pat on the back, you're persisting through the early stages of game development. Good for you! Now, this chapter gets a little bit hands-on; it will prepare you for what is to come in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Make Some Prefabs</em></span>. We will get you familiar with all the different settings and tools in Unity when it comes to handling Sprites. In addition, we will also begin our journey into 2D game development.
