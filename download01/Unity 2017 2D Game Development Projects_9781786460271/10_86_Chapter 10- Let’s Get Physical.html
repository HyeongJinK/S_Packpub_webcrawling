You will learn all about 2D physics in Unity, and how it can be applied to the platform game. Here, we will learn this by applying physics to actions such as jumping and moving through forces. In particular, we will implement a <span class="strong"><strong>Movement Component</strong></span> (which will take care of controlling the Animation State Machine of the previous chapter, as well as moving the character using physics) along with a <span class="strong"><strong>Player Controller</strong></span> (which will send input based on the keyboard to the Movement Component). Keep in mind that if it is difficult to understand now, it will be much easier by the end of the chapter.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Physics Material 2<span>D</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Finishing to set up the Environment</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating our Hero</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Movement Component for moving, jumping, and controlling the State Machine</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Player Controller for processing input based on the keyboard</li></ul></div><p>With this said, let's begin.</p></div>
