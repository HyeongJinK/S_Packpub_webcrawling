It is a reusable <code class="literal">GameObject</code> stored in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code> Window</code></strong>. Prefabs can be inserted (multiple times) into any number of Scenes within your Unity game project. When you add a Prefab to a Scene, you create an instance of it. What this means is that all Prefab instances are linked to the original Prefab and are essentially a clone of it. This is particularly useful when you want to have multiple instances of an object, such as a health pickup. Instead of having to adjust each one individually, you just update the original Prefab (for example, color, graphics, properties) and it will automatically update all the other instances of the health pick-up within the game. You may find that at some stage, you're editing an instance and want these changes to be reflected in the original Prefab. Unity allows you to do this easily by way of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>. When you click a Prefab instance within your Scene, you will see buttons: <strong class="userinput"><code>Select</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Revert</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong>. The <strong class="userinput"><code>Select</code></strong> button selects the original Prefab. This allows you to edit the main Prefab and so change all its instances. However, you can also save overridden values (excluding transform settings) from an instance, back to the original Prefab by clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong> button. If you have modified an instance of the Prefab but decided that you don't like the changes, you can simply go back to the default values by clicking <strong class="userinput"><code>Revert</code></strong> before clicking the <strong class="userinput"><code>Apply</code></strong> button.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec45"></a>Creating the Prefab for the player and the cake</h3></div></div></div><p>To create the Prefabs for our game, we need first to create a <code class="literal">Prefab</code> folder in our <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong>. You can do this by following these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Right-click (in our <code class="literal">Prefab</code> folder) and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Create </code></strong>| <strong class="userinput"><code>Prefab</code></strong>. We need to do this twice and rename them respectively <code class="literal">Cake</code> and <code class="literal">Player</code>.</li><li>From the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel, we need to drag the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Player</code></strong> prefab and <strong class="userinput"><code>Angel's Cake</code></strong> into <strong class="userinput"><code>Angel's Cake</code></strong> prefab(as it was obvious). As you can see, they become blue in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> panel. This is fine because now they are linked to the Prefab, as we were saying in the previous section.</li></ol></div><p>As a result, we can easily drag and drop the components we need ready to go, whenever we need them. We can remove all of the instances of the cakes and the player from the Scene since we can drag and drop the Prefabs from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project</code></strong> panel now. Before we leave the chapter, there is one more thing to do… Build our map!</p></div></div>
