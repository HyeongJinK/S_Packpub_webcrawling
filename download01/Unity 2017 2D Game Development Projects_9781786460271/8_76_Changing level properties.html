<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch08lvl1sec77"></a>Changing level properties</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>With our level done, we have one last thing to complete before we're finished with Tiled. We need to now change the properties of our levels. To begin:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Terrain</code></strong> layer.</li><li>Navigate to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong> panel on the left-hand side of the screen.
</li><li>Add the following <strong class="userinput"><code>Custom Properties</code></strong>:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unity:SortingLayerName</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unity:SortingOrder</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unity:isTrigger</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unity:layer</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unity:tagged</code></li></ul></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note40"></a>Note</h3><p>The reason why we have added these custom properties is that later when you export the level with <code class="literal">Tile2Unity</code>, the software will read these custom properties to correctly import the map into Unity, with all the parameters you have specified. By doing this, you will avoid a lot of manual work in the later stages.</p></div><p>In the next screenshot, you can see an example of this along with the settings used for this project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/46cffdfb-53bf-4830-ad78-b1688950ece4.png" /></div><p>You will need to complete the above steps again for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Water</code></strong> layer if you have included water in your map. However, in this case, make sure that the <strong class="userinput"><code>unity:isTrigger</code></strong> is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>True</code></strong>. This is because, when the player is navigating around the map, we want to make sure that the game knows when the player falls into the water, and as a result, an action can occur, such as losing points or health.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"></a>Note</h3><p>To save time, especially if you are using the same Custom Properties, you can select all of the custom properties within the Terrain layer and copy them. Then, when you select the Water layer, you can paste them and adjust the values accordingly.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec105"></a>Adding colliders to our tiles</h3></div></div></div><p>Once we have changed the properties of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Terrain</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Water</code></strong> layers, we now need to add colliders to our tiles. To do this, you need to:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Select that tile from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tilesets</code></strong> panel.</li><li>Then, navigate to <strong class="userinput"><code>View</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Tile Collision Editor</code></strong>. You should now have a screen that looks like the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/2152db0d-c3d0-4673-92ab-87db16cb3aee.png" /></div><p>Lastly, in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Tile Collision Editor</code></strong>, select the rectangle tool (as highlighted in the following screenshot), and make sure that you draw a rectangle so that it is the same size as the tile, like so:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/f6ec442b-ea21-43d3-bccc-2846d0d514bc.png" /></div><p>You will have to repeat the above steps for each tile that has been used within the map that the player will collide with. In our example, this isn't an issue because we will need to add colliders onto everything. But for Tilesets which have tiles that contain decorative assets such as various plants or other environmental adorations, you won’t need to add a collider. Once you have finished adding colliders to all of the tiles, save it and open Unity.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"></a>Note</h3><p>There are many great features that Tiled offers, which we won't cover in this book. These features can help you to create more detailed and complex maps. Therefore, I encourage you to actively check out the documentation on their official website, by visiting the following link: <a class="ulink" href="http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/</a>.
Another place that I recommend checking out is this series of video tutorials: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/10/14/Tiled-Map-Editor-Tutorial-Series.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/10/14/Tiled-Map-Editor-Tutorial-Series.aspx</a>. Even though they are a little old, they cover quite a few things about Tiled that are still relevant to the current builds.</p></div></div></div>
