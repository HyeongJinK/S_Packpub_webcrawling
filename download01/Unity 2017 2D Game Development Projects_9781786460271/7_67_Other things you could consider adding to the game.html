Nothing says excitement more than a countdown. For instance, you can implement different modes, in which the player is invincible and has to get as many points as possible in a small amount of time. Maybe, instead of losing lives, if the player is hit, the score is decreased by five.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec101"></a>Increase the speed</h3></div></div></div><p>Who doesn't like a little bit of fast-paced action? As the player gets better at the game, instead of increasing the strength of the enemy, you could make the game get faster. One way to do this, especially with top-down games, is to have the environment scroll faster as well as increasing your enemies' speed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec102"></a>Combos</h3></div></div></div><p>You may have kept to what we have discussed so far, you may have also added other characters and enemies. In either case, you will need to make sure that the game is and feels balanced. One way that you can manage issues with balancing can be by implementing combos. Combos offer you a way to reward players who improve their skills and encourage those who perhaps are not so good. In each instance, combos can help to facilitate a level playing field when given appropriately.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec103"></a>Bosses and waves</h3></div></div></div><p>As anticipated in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch06">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No One Is Alone Forever</em></span>, you can create bosses. If you follow the suggestion to read the book quoted in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Spawning system</em></span> section, you will be able to count how many enemies are left for a wave, and at the end spawn a big boss!</p></div></div>
