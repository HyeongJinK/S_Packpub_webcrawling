First of all, we like the idea of setting it in space, and, of course, it will be a 2D game. Riding the coattails of the success of <span class="emphasis"><em>Space Invaders</em></span>, we can try to do something similar. So, the player will control a spaceship, which is at the bottom of the screen and can move only to the left or right. We could allow the player to go also up and down, but that would complicate the AI a little too much. Then, we don't like the idea of having shields protecting the player, since we want the game to be more challenging. However, we like that the player has a limited number of lives and that they are shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen.</p><p>This is a screenshot of how the game should look at the end of these three chapters:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/d8adffe1-acf8-4b06-9a18-333d0330fb2b.png" /></div></div>
