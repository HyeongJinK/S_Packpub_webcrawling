However, before using it, we must first make sure that it is enabled within Unity. To do this, go to <strong class="userinput"><code><span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span></code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Editor</code></strong><span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span></p><p>Once you have done this, look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>; you can change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Packer</code></strong> from <strong class="userinput"><code>disabled</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>Always Enabled</code></strong> or vice versa<span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span> You can see an example of this in the following screenshot. By selecting <strong class="userinput"><code>Always Enabled</code></strong>. The Sprite Packer will always be enabled whenever you start a new project. That way, you will not need to worry about enabling it again:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/652a4bf3-529d-4f86-a1f6-e895ef11681d.png" /></div><p>One of the benefits of using this is that it can boost the performance of your game by reducing the number of <strong class="userinput"><code>Draw Calls</code></strong> each frame. This is because a significant portion of a Sprite Texture will often be taken up by the empty space between the graphic elements. As a result, it wastes video memory at runtime because it needs to compute this empty space even if there is nothing there. By keeping this in mind, when you are creating your own Sprites, try to pack graphics from several Sprite Textures together and as close as possible to one another within an Atlas. Lastly, keep in mind that depending on the sizes of your Sprites, an Atlas should not be larger than 2048 x 2048 or 2<sup>11</sup> (or at least, this guarantees compatibility with many devices). Therefore, if you need to resize some elements within your scene, revisit the power of 2 table in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Press Start</em></span>, to see what values you can use to better utilize the dimensions of the Atlas. This is handy only if you want all the Sprites to be in one Atlas. Otherwise, if your Sprites are bigger than the Atlas's maximum dimensions, or you're trying to pack more Sprites than a single Atlas can handle, it will create multiple pages. We will cover this in more detail later in the book.</p><p>Unity handles the generation and use of Sprite Atlas Textures behind the scenes so that the user does not need to do any manual assignment. The Atlas can optionally be packed on entering <strong class="userinput"><code>Play</code></strong> mode or during a build, and the graphics for a sprite object will be obtained from the Atlas once it is generated. Users are required to specify a Packing Tag in the Texture Importer to enable packing for Sprites of that Texture.</p><p>To use the Sprite packer, simply go to the top navigation menu and select <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Window</code></strong></strong></span> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Packer</code></strong>.</p><p>Once you have done this, it will open the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Packer</code></strong>.</p></div>
