For those new to this, there are a few other things to keep in mind (other than the power of 2) when doing this. We'll discuss some of these things in the following section.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Textures</h3></div></div></div><p>While we have been emphasizing the Power Of Two, it is for a reason. Not only will they be more efficient, they also won't need rescaling at build time. As we have already said, in Unity you can use up to 4096x4096 pixels (make sure that you use these units in your graphics program), but 2048x2048 pixels is the highest available on many graphics cards and platforms. In other words, your game might not run with Textures higher than 2048x2048. So, if you build an absolutely fabulous 4096x4096 pixels Texture, it probably won't be such an absolutely fabulous experience for those on low-end devices. The best way to overcome this issue is to create Textures in a high resolution (4096x4096 pixels) and then downsize to a smaller power of 2 depending on your targeted device, as this is likely to vary. This goes for all repeated elements (for example, windows, doors, environmental assets) that will be within your scene.</p><p>Moreover, <span class="strong"><strong>Power Of Two</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>POT</strong></span>) Textures (which have dimensions with a number of pixels corresponding to a POT) are recommended over <span class="strong"><strong>Non-Power Of Two</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NPOT</strong></span>) Textures because they are better for computational reasons (for example, more efficiency at runtime). We will look at the disadvantages and advantages of both, so you can see why:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>POT advantages</strong></span>: Always supported by any graphics card.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>POT disadvantages</strong></span>: Requires more disk space. Needs to be handled by the engine to only draw the parts that are needed if the image data inside the Texture does not use all pixels (in most cases, this is true and means extra work to be done by the graphics/game engine).
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>NPOT advantages</strong></span>: Uses Textures as they are; no waste of disk space per Texture file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>NPOT disadvantages</strong></span>: Not supported by all graphics cards. Might cause slower draw calls. Some graphics cards will show empty white or black rectangles, or the whole application will just crash. While saving some disk space to store the image file, it is going to waste VRAM when the Texture is uploaded to the graphics card as it will still be aligned in memory as if it were a POT image. The wasted pixel data might even cause pixel bleeding, which will show up as some fuzzy borders that haven’t been drawn anywhere in Textures but are added by graphics card drivers through mipmapping Textures.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"></a>Note</h3><p>There's also the possibility to mix POT sizes per axis, for example, 128x1024. This can work but it doesn't have to on all graphics cards, so POT with the same size for both axes is the best way to go for maximum co-compatibility.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec32"></a>Maximizing the space that you have</h4></div></div></div><p>Another important thing to remember when creating your own Textures is to maximize the space within the Texture itself when you're combining multiple images. However, be aware of different materials requiring different parts of the same Texture. You can end up using or loading that Texture multiple times. In addition, some Textures may also have an alpha channel, which makes part of the Texture transparent. Lastly, for parts of a texture that are tiled, you don't need to add the image tiled more than once. In general, you only need the part that is tileable; Unity will take care of the rest. Not only will this help to increase the resolution of a tileable image, it will also save space. Fortunately, there are a few programs out there that help to make this whole process easy, such as <span class="strong"><strong>TexturePacker</strong></span>, which you can find by either visiting <a class="ulink" href="https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/unity" target="_blank">https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/unity</a> or by scanning the QR code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/07a06106-b204-4882-b47e-5797ecb96f08.png" /></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"></a>Scaling</h3></div></div></div><p>This is an issue for 2D as much as it is for 3D. Setting a scale within your graphics program will give you much fewer (if any at all) headaches later when it comes to bringing things into Unity. Different programs use different measurements by default, so you will need to make sure that if you're using graphics programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, your measurements are consistent – 3 mm is very different from 3 cm and 3 px.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"></a>Naming</h3></div></div></div><p>As we have already discussed in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Press Start</em></span>, naming your Sprites is as important as naming any other file. Whether you're cutting up Sprite Sheets or creating placeholder Sprites, consistent names are important.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note20"></a>Note</h3><p>If there is one piece of advice any newcomer to Sprite Sheets should learn early on, it is this: one thing that can be painful, and by painful I mean you might prefer to walk on hot coals, is updating a <code class="literal">Sprite</code> file. To put it bluntly, you know every name that you have given to every single sprite within an image file? Well, when you update the image file, it must be resliced and every slice must be renamed...again. Even with something as simple as changing the name of the file, <span>unless it is absolutely necessary due to issues relating to project files (e.g. an error with the naming convention);</span> you will still have to go through this process. So, the old saying "<span class="emphasis"><em>measure twice, cut once</em></span>" absolutely applies here.</p></div></div></div>
