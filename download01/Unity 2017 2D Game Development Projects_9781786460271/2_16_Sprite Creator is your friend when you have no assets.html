If you don't have Sprites, you can always add placeholders or images in the place of where they are likely to be. This is a useful thing to use when you're prototyping an idea and you need to get functionality working before your images are ready to go. Using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Creator</code></strong> is quite simple.</p><p>We can create a placeholder Sprite by doing the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>First, select <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Assets</code></strong></strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Create</code></strong></strong></span> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprites</code></strong>.</li><li>Next, select the placeholder Sprite you want to make, like in the following screenshot. Unity offers only six different placeholder Sprites: <strong class="userinput"><code>Square</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Circle</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Triangle</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Diamond</code></strong>, <strong class="userinput"><code>Hexagon</code></strong>, and <strong class="userinput"><code>Polygon</code></strong>. Before creating the Sprite, it is important to make sure that you select the folder that you want the Sprite to be created in. This just saves time later from having to move it to the correct folder. This is because, when creating a Sprite with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Creator</code></strong>, it will automatically place it in the <code class="literal">Asset</code> folder that you currently have open in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Project Window</code></strong>.</li><li>Lastly, from the list, select the placeholder Sprite that you wish to use:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/e2b27537-f817-4454-a623-4da0c4b46513.png" /></div><p>Once you have chosen your Sprite, it will appear as a white shape. The Texture created by Unity will use the <code class="literal">.png</code> file format and contain default image data of 4x4 white pixels. At this stage, the new Sprite will have a default name based on its shapes, such as <strong class="userinput"><code>Square</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>Circle</code></strong>. You have the option to rename it, but if you don't change it, don't worry, as each additional Sprite that is the same shape will simply have a number following its name. You can, of course, always change the name of the Sprite later by clicking on it in the <code class="literal">Asset</code> folder where it is located:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/555f3ec2-d380-42c4-bcb8-7ddb907735f8.png" /></div><p>Once your new Sprite has been created, simply drag and drop your placeholder Sprite into the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view or <strong class="userinput"><code>Hierarchy</code></strong> to start using it in your project. An example of this can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/0745aa6d-35f2-4616-902c-cdbede72a162.png" /></div><p>Once you're done, whether it is a mock-up, prototype, or something else, you may want to change the placeholder Sprite to the actual image. Once you have imported the new image(s), simply do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong> within the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene</code></strong> view so that it is selected.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>Now, in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Inspector</code></strong>, locate <span class="strong"><strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite Renderer Component</code></strong></strong></span>. An example of this is shown in the following screenshot:
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/37fb98d8-fffc-4443-9702-ec116cec29bb.png" /></div></li><li>Now, where it says <strong class="userinput"><code>Sprite</code></strong>, click on the small circle located next to the Sprite name, in this case, <strong class="userinput"><code>Hexagon</code></strong>. This is highlighted in the following screenshot:
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/113566de-2876-46d8-9a33-c3ebdbcc7c9f.png" /></div></li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Now, a small window will be displayed, like in the following screenshot:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786460271/graphics/05fab5c6-a97e-4f38-97b3-b316cd2087c9.png" /></div><p>The Sprite Creator makes 4x4 white PNG outline Textures, which is a power of 2-sized Texture that is actually generated by an algorithm.</p></div>
