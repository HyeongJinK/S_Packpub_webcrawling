<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch04lvl1sec48"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>One of the things that you want to make sure you do along the way is to test your game, and not just on one device, on but many.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec66"></a>More kinds of cakes</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, the first challenge is to add different kinds of cakes, or at least, different collectables. In the first place, you can still use the <code class="literal">CollectableCake</code> script and change their values. But remember to create a prefab, and add all the proper colliders. For instance, in the package you can find a purple diamond, that is a good start to make objects with more values.</p><p>However, when you've got different cakes and/or objects with different values, you don't want to calculate the sum of their values by hand. In this case, we can set the <code class="literal">pointsToNextLevel</code> variable in the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function of the <code class="literal">UI_Score</code> script.</p><p>Here is a possible example:</p><pre class="programlisting">// Use this for initialization
void Start () {
<span class="strong"><strong>    //Get a reference to the Text component</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    uiText = GetComponent&lt;Text&gt;();</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    //Get the sum of all the cake values around the level</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    foreach(CollectableCake cake in FindObjectsOfType&lt;CollectableCake&gt;()) {</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        pointsToNextLevel += cake.cakeValue;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    }</strong></span>
}</pre><p>Other suggestions include creating a second score system similar to the first one for another kind of collectible or adding some power-ups. So when the player collects this specific object, the script increases the speed in the <code class="literal">PlayerController</code>. But these are just a few examples.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec67"></a>Adding more levels</h3></div></div></div><p>Another good challenge for your level is to include other levels in your game. Every time the player reaches the number of points to the next level, instead of displaying the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game Over Screen</code></strong>, the player can jump to a second or third level. In order to do so, you might want to visit the official documentation of Unity regarding the <strong class="userinput"><code>Scene Manager</code></strong><span>here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.html" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.html</a></span>
You can also add the number of levels in the interface.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec68"></a>Adding animations</h3></div></div></div><p>In the next projects, we will learn more about how to animate our characters. However, this package already comes with animations, and if you are up to the challenge, you can try to explore the animation system by yourself. Here a little hint is to select all the sprites that compose an animation and drag them in the scene. Unity will ask you to save the animation file, and I'd suggest you create another folder for those. Then, the characters should already be good to go. From there, you can see the effects of animating a character.</p><p>In any case, you can keep reading this book, and come back here later.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec69"></a>Devils</h3></div></div></div><p>The greatest challenge for you would be to add some devils (enemies). They don't need to be complex and chase the player; in fact, they can just move from one spot to another on the map, and the player needs to avoid them.
Here are some suggestions on how to implement them.</p><p>Remember to attach the proper colliders and set them as a trigger. Every time the player hits the devil, you can show the <strong class="userinput"><code>Game Over</code></strong> menu. You can just use the same line of code for the <code class="literal">UI_GameOver</code> script:</p><pre class="programlisting">SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex);</pre><p>To make the enemy move from one spot to another, you need to create some empty game objects in the game called waypoints. Then, you need to give a set (or even just two of them) in the script that controls the devil and makes it move toward one. When the devil reaches that waypoint, it comes back to the first one (or continues on the list, if you want to implement a list of waypoints). To check whether a devil reached a waypoint, you can calculate the distance between the devil and the waypoint. If this is below a certain threshold, then you can consider that the devil has reached the waypoint.</p><p>Of course, this is quite a challenge, but I’m sure you will do fine if you persist. Also, you can first finish reading the book, and then improve all the games you have created once you have more confidence in Unity.</p></div></div>
