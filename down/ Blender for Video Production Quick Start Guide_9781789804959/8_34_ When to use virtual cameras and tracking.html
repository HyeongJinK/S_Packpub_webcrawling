As well as getting all the options regarding video editing, you also have at hand a full-featured 3D creation environment.</p><p>One of the advantages of that 3D environment is the ability to use motion tracking tools to make virtual cameras. The use of such motion tracking abilities will give you the power to work with all types of projects, blending live-action footage with virtual content.</p><p>A common use of such a technique is when you have footage with a green screen, and you want to add or replace content using that special space.</p><p>For instance, you may want to add a background to a scene or create something that is missing from the footage. For example, you can use this technique with technology videos, where you will get a device that doesn't have a system yet and add that later in a video.</p><p>In <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 8.1</em></span>, you will see a frame from a project that uses this concept; it shows an actor holding a smartphone that doesn't have a system on the screen. Instead of a full user interface, you will see a green screen with some markers:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/1cfebed9-3728-40f6-a4a3-6b85ecb1a958.png" /></div><p>Figure 8.1: Smartphone video</p><p>The green screen will help you replace all the colors from the video, but the real difference in that footage is the markers. There is a reason why the cross-hair is put in. Blender will search for interesting points in a video to create the virtual camera, and having points with high contrast will make the process of identifying those points a lot easier.</p><p>For that reason, if you need to <span>produce</span><a id="id325727153" class="indexterm"></a> such footage to later edit the <span>content</span><a id="id325727266" class="indexterm"></a> in Blender for tracking, you can add tracking points to any location. Just keep in mind that you will have to either hide or remove them from the final product.</p></div>
