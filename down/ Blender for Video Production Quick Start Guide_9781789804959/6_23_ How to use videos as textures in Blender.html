When you mix 3D graphics such as planes with textures to make a video, you can create almost any type of content.</p><p>However, using textures will give you much more freedom to overcome a limitation of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>Editor</code></strong>. Until now, we have managed to add videos to the Sequencer to cut and mount in several different ways. One thing you can't do with videos in the Sequencer is to scale down two clips and show them at the same time in the render (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 6.1</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/97a71bd5-6648-44aa-8e16-efb864bde108.png" /></div><p>Figure 6.1: Two videos side by side</p><p>For projects that require you to create a more complex infographic using multiple videos at once, having this limitation will be a huge problem.</p><p>One feature of Blender related to textures will allow you to overcome that problem and <span>successfully</span><a id="id326120160" class="indexterm"></a> add multiple videos to the project.

If you want to avoid any potential compatibility problems, I suggest the use of standard video files in containers, such as MP4 or MOV. For the codec, you should look for H264 for maximum compatibility and smaller sizes.</p><p>You can use other types of codec such as WebM or MPEG-4. As a rule of thumb, you can use the same formats that Blender can produce.

To create <span>the</span><a id="id326450800" class="indexterm"></a> animation for this <span>particular</span><a id="id326450808" class="indexterm"></a> project, we will, once again, start from the last frame and build the rest of our motion. If you change your current frame to <code class="literal">600</code>, you will have the final location for all elements in the infographic.</p><p>Select all objects in your scene, leaving only the camera and light source unselected. You can use the <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> key to select all objects, and right-click on the camera and light while holding the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key.</p><p>With the objects selected, use the <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> key to add a location keyframe for all of them.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec18"></a>Animating the left panel</h4></div></div></div><p>The left panel has a total of <span>three</span><a id="id325969529" class="indexterm"></a> objects: two instances of 3D texts and the background. Now, it is an excellent time to add some materials and colors for those elements. Make the text white and the background light blue for contrast.</p><p>All objects in this panel will enter the screen from the left. First, you will have the background sliding in until it fills one-third of the screen. When the background stops, you will have the first lot of text sliding in followed by the next.</p><p>Set your current frame as <code class="literal">48</code> and select the background plane. Add a location keyframe to the plane. Go to frame 1 and move the plane all the way to the left, until it is entirely out of the screen.</p><p>Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> key and you can insert another location keyframe. Don't worry about timing at this point. We can adjust the speed of our animation later.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note33"></a>Note</h3><p>If you choose to create animations for video using a different frame rate, remember to make the adjustments to the length.

We will start getting the first text lot of moving after the background is in place. Since we set the final movement of that plane as frame 48, we will make both instances of text stay still from frame 1 to 48.</p><p>Keeping the backward technique, we are using until this point; you should start your process by marking the final location of the first text.</p><p><span>Here is a breakdown of each frame and the order in which you should edit them</span>:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 60</strong></span>: This will be the final text location, and since we already have it there, you can select the object and, using the <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> key, add a location keyframe.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 58</strong></span>: Remember the extrapolation effect? Go to this frame and move the text just a little to the right, and add a location keyframe.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 48</strong></span>: Move the text to the left, outside of your screen area. Add a location keyframe to the object.</li></ol></div><p></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note34"></a>Note</h3><p>From an animation perspective, the use of frame 58 is optional since it will only add the extrapolation effect. However, you should always use that type of extrapolation move to make the animation a lot more interesting.</p></div><p>What about the second instance of text? You can use the same frame distribution and actions, with a small adjustment. The second instance of text will start to move with a small delay.</p><p>Assuming the final frame, our second text is 70. You can add the keyframes in the following order:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 70</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 68</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 58</li></ul></div><p>Use the same types of keyframes for <span>those</span><a id="id326450956" class="indexterm"></a> frames, and you will have the motion for the second text!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec20"></a>Animating the right panel and videos</h4></div></div></div><p>With our left panel ready, we can <span>move</span><a id="id326451005" class="indexterm"></a> on to finish animation at the <span>right</span><a id="id326451014" class="indexterm"></a> panel. The background plane will move from right to left in a simple slide motion. To synchronize this <span>with all other pieces of the composition, you should use frame 80 as the final location, and 70 as the starting point:</span></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 80</strong></span>: Set the current frame to 80 and add a location keyframe. This will be the final location for our background.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 70</strong></span>: Go back to frame 70 and move the background all the way to the right, until it is entirely out of the camera frame. Add a location keyframe.</li></ol></div><p>By hitting <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ space, you will see the background sliding into the scene from the right.</p><p>Now, it is time to work with our two planes that have a video texture. To keep our animations following the same pattern, we can use the same extrapolation technique. The first plane will have frame 90 as it's final location, and frame 100 will be the second plane.</p><p><span>Select the top 3D plane that has a video texture and in:</span></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 90</strong></span>: Add a location keyframe with the plane in their final location.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 88</strong></span>: Move the plane just a little bit to the left, and add a location keyframe.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 78</strong></span>: Move the plane all the way to the right, until it is out of your camera frame. Add a location keyframe.</li></ol></div><p>That will set the animation for the camera. If you set the <strong class="userinput"><code>Cyclic</code></strong> option in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Image Texture Node</code></strong>, you will have an animation loop for the video. For the lower 3D plane, you can perform the same procedure, but with the following frames:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 100</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 98</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Frame 88</li></ul></div><p>As the last step is to set the animation for our project, we can add the motion for both icons in the project. <span>The two objects will share the same starting and end frames, with the only difference being that one will slide in from the top and the other from below:</span></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 120</strong></span>: Select both objects and add a location keyframe. Don't move them around now, since frame 120 is their final location.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 118</strong></span>: With only the top plane selected, move the object just a little towards the center. Add a location keyframe. Select the lower plane and repeat the process.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Frame 110</strong></span>: The final stage is to move objects outside of our camera frame. Get the top plane and move it up until it is out of the frame. Add a location keyframe. Repeat the process with the lower plane, but move it downwards instead. Add a location keyframe.</li></ol></div><p>After all that keyframe and timeline manipulation, you will get a full working infographic. Have you noticed something interesting about the process we just performed? It is a repetitive task that will require you to add keyframes to multiple objects, working only <span>about</span><a id="id326298059" class="indexterm"></a> timing and the order in <span>which</span><a id="id326298068" class="indexterm"></a> things will move around.</p><p>That is a crucial point to create animations and infographics for video in Blender. It does not matter if you have only five or six objects to animate; you will probably use the same process for all objects.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec40"></a>Adjusting timing for animations</h3></div></div></div><p>Like all other projects that we <span>made</span><a id="id326298087" class="indexterm"></a> in previous chapters, you can change timing and motion using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Dope Sheet</code></strong> window. Although you can use the window to resize and set animation timing by spacing keyframes, you should take extra care with any edits.</p><p>Since we are using a synchronized motion for each element in our project, you should make group changes by selecting only a few objects at the time.</p><p>How do you do that?
