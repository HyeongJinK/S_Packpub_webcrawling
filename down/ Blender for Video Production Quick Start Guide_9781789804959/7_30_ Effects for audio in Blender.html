But, when the subject is audio effects, the list will dramatically shrink.</p><p>If you take a close look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Effect Strip</code></strong> list, you won't find any effect aimed at audio. What can we do with sound regarding effects?</p><p>For audio effects in Blender, we will have to use the properties in the sidebar. You can manage using volume controls and pitch. As for the effects, you will be able to see the property for the entire strip or choose only a small subset of your audio.</p><p>If you use the properties in the sidebar alongside keyframes, you will be able to apply those effects to only a small part of your audio strip.</p><p>Here is an example of how that will work. Assuming you have an audio strip that has 450 frames in duration, and between frames 300 and 390 you have a few words from the voiceover that need emphasis.</p><p>To get that effect, we will use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Pitch</code></strong> property to make the voice deeper between those frames.</p><p>Starting with frame 299, which is one frame before the beginning of our effect, you can add a keyframe to the property. While you have the mouse cursor above the <strong class="userinput"><code>Pitch</code></strong> property, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> key.</p><p>In frame 300, change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Pitch</code></strong> value to 2 and add another keyframe. Go to frame 390 and add a keyframe.</p><p>As a way to set your effect only <span>between</span><a id="id325725657" class="indexterm"></a> those two frames, you can now go to frame 391 and return the <strong class="userinput"><code>Pitch</code></strong> to the default value. And add another keyframe.</p><p>The secret to creating effects in just a limited number of frames in any audio strip is the use of keyframes.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec42"></a>Adding background music to a video</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the most common <span>effects</span><a id="id325727114" class="indexterm"></a> you may want to use for a video is the creation of background music for the production. That will involve two audio tracks, where one of them is the voiceover; the other will be your background music.</p><p>The idea here is to make your background music start with a standard volume setting, and when the voiceover begins, you will lower the music volume to make it become just a faint sound.</p><p>How do you create such an effect? In Blender, you will make that effect by using the same procedure we already used in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Properties to Enhance Video</em></span>.</p><p>Assuming you have a video that has your voiceover starting at frame 220 from a total of 885 frames, you can select the track representing the background music and set the current frame to 1.</p><p>In the sidebar, you will locate the <strong class="userinput"><code>Volume</code></strong> property for that audio, and add a keyframe. Place the mouse cursor on top of the value and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> key. Go to frame 210 and also add a keyframe with no changes to the volume level.</p><p>At frame 220, set the volume value to 0.15 and add another keyframe. That will create a fade-out effect for your audio, which will help with the transition from full volume to a much lower level (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.7</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/b1564008-65a3-4158-ac02-8db41feb0522.png" /></div><p>Figure 7.7: Keyframe distribution</p><p>After you set the keyframes for that property in your sidebar, you can get more visual control over the volume property.</p><p>In the video editing workspace, you can open a <strong class="userinput"><code>Graph Editor</code></strong>. With the audio strip still selected, you will see a curve representation of your keyframes (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.8</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/8548714a-febb-4bcc-9ebe-c1e955ba8db5.png" /></div><p>Figure 7.8: Graph Editor</p><p>Pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Home</em></span> key will adjust your graph view to fit any window size you have. In the <strong class="userinput"><code>Graph Editor</code></strong>, you can right-click on each point in the graphic to move or adjust the effect.</p><p>For instance, if you feel your audio is way too low after frame 220, you can select the last keyframe with a right-click, and using the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key, move the point up. That will raise the volume of your background music.</p><p>The graphics view provided by this <span>window</span><a id="id326089002" class="indexterm"></a> will help you with interactive control over any animation data. By the way, you can use the controls on any other type of animation.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip37"></a>Note</h3><p>You can control the curve transition for this graphic using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Key</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Handle Type</code></strong>. Choose the <strong class="userinput"><code>vector</code></strong> type to have a linear transition or <strong class="userinput"><code>smooth</code></strong> for a gradual transition.</p></div></div></div>
