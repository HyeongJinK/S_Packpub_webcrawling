When you have two independent strips for audio and video, it might become critical to keep them in sync.</p><p>If you select any of the strips and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key, you can freely move them around, and once you do that, you no longer have audio and video in sync.</p><p>That will happen even for video footage that has an existing audio track. By selecting either one of them, just one, and pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key will make you move the strip as a single object. As a result, you will get totally out-of-sync audio and video.</p><p>How do you avoid that? The solution to keeping your audio and video in sync is to create something called MetaStrips. Those strips will work as a group, preventing and keeping all footage in sync.</p><p>To create a <strong class="userinput"><code>MetaStrip</code></strong>, you have to select two or more strips and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> keys. You will see a new visual for your footage and the name <strong class="userinput"><code>MetaStrip</code></strong> will display next to the  object (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 7.4</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/79db830d-b5a2-4d54-989c-8ce6ea8e2dec.png" /></div><p>Figure 7.4: MetaStrips</p><p></p><p>The MetaStrips will lock access to the individual strips, which will prevent you from making any accidental changes to the footage. To view and edit the contents of a <strong class="userinput"><code>MetaStrip</code></strong>, you can press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Tab</em></span> key with a MetaStrip selected.</p><p>And to split the contents of a <strong class="userinput"><code>MetaStrip</code></strong>, you <span>can</span><a id="id325727124" class="indexterm"></a> use the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> keys.
