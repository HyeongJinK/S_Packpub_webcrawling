One of the primary goals of Blender is to make 3D content for animation, effects, and other types of productions. How is it possible to edit video in Blender? Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/40a7dec2-1588-40d8-b383-0643d71c36c3.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.1: Blender default interface</p><p>Besides having all those tools for 3D content creation, Blender will also feature a lot more options. One of those options is a video editor inside the software. Unlike many competitors in 3D content creation, Blender's developers wanted to create a tool that could handle all aspects of media production.</p><p>If you have an idea that requires 3D content creation that will result in a video file, you can create that in Blender. Better yet, you will be able to get additional footage and blend it with your 3D content.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note3"></a>Note</h3><p>In the past, Blender even had an integrated game engine for interactive 3D creation.</p></div><p>One crucial aspect of the Blender user interface that you will notice is that you can change and manipulate almost all aspects related to windows. Look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.1</em></span>, and you will see divisions at the interface. Each division might assume a unique function, depending on what you want to do with the software.</p><p>The main windows available in the default user interface are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>3D View</code></strong>: The sizeable 3D space with a tray cube that will allow you to add and manipulate such content</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Timeline</code></strong>: At the bottom of your <strong class="userinput"><code>3D View</code></strong> you will see a horizontal window showing options to play back and set animation</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong>: On the right-hand side, you have a tall vertical window called <strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong>, where you will get options to render and change lots of options regarding a scene</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Outliner</code></strong>: Finally, we will also <span>find</span><a id="id326388833" class="indexterm"></a> a small window in the upper-right corner with a word, <strong class="userinput"><code>Collection 1</code></strong>, where you can organize 3D content in your scene</li></ul></div><p>Which one of these will be the best option for video editing? None of them. We have to use another window that is not part of the default user interface.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec4"></a>The Blender Video Sequencer and workspaces</h3></div></div></div><p><span>If</span> you want to edit <span>video</span><a id="id326388860" class="indexterm"></a> footage in Blender, you need a specific <span>window</span><a id="id326388869" class="indexterm"></a> to manipulate <span>and</span><a id="id326388877" class="indexterm"></a> handle that type of data. You can swap the window type in <span>Blender</span><a id="id326388884" class="indexterm"></a> for an other depending on your project. To change your window type, you can use the small selector available on the left-hand side of each division, as shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.2</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/847784a3-daa1-4b28-8d61-6c6285536ad8.png" /></div><p>
Figure 1.2: Window selector</p><p>To edit and manipulate video, we must use a window called <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.3</em></span>). Using a large window space like the one with our <strong class="userinput"><code>3D View</code></strong> will give you plenty of room to work with video editing:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/d1a24a70-ebc4-42f3-9246-7523ee3e070c.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.3: Video Sequencer</p><p>Once you open the video editor, you will see that such a window has a lot of horizontal spaces. Each of those parallel spaces is a channel, which works like layers. You can stack video footage on top of each other to create a composition.</p><p>The footage on channel zero will be at the bottom of the pile, and anything placed at higher channels will be at the top.</p><p>We will import and manipulate video and audio inside those channels for any project related to video production.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec0"></a>Previewing our video project</h4></div></div></div><p>The Video Sequencer is a great <span>tool</span><a id="id326402946" class="indexterm"></a> to edit and manipulate video footage, but you will quickly notice that it doesn't have any particular area showing a preview of what you have in your project. We can enable a split view of our sequencer with a preview area to help us see the final result.</p><p>In the upper-left corner of your <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong>, you will find a button for the <strong class="userinput"><code>View Type</code></strong> that will be set to Sequencer by default.

In Blender, you will find something called workspaces, a user interface layout that has all windows and options for a given task.</p><p>You will find the workspaces selector at the top of your user interface (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.5</em></span>). Click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> icon to open all options related to workspaces:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/58f338a2-6542-4232-9032-096b91fc6926.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.5: Workspace selector</p><p>By default, you will have a generic workspace called <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong> whenever you start Blender, but we can create many more.

There are two ways to import or add media to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong>. The first one is with the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> menu, where you can click at the option and choose from several alternatives (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.7</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/ff5e59e3-da60-4227-a008-a24d6d22362a.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.7: Add menu</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot, we have an option to add the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Movie</code></strong>: Using this option will import a video file to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong>: If you have to work with images, use this option. It will import either a single file or a sequence of images.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Sound</code></strong>: For music and sound, you must use this option.</li></ul></div><p>The <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> menu has a shortcut for quick access in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong>. If you press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> keys when your mouse cursor is anywhere, the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong> window will show a pop-up menu with the same options.</p><p>Why does the cursor position matter? Blender has a lot of shortcuts that will save you time on different tasks. Since some shortcuts work in a unique way for specific windows, you must tell the software where you want to use a shortcut.</p><p>For instance, if you press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> keys with the cursor over the <strong class="userinput"><code>Timeline</code></strong> window, nothing will happen. Why? Because in some windows you can't create any objects. If you press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> key with the cursor over a <strong class="userinput"><code>3D</code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>View</code></strong> window, you will be able to create 3D geometry and not import video footage.</p><p>Blender calls the window where your cursor is at the moment the active window. All shortcuts will trigger the action in the active window.</p><p>When you press a shortcut and you don't have the expected behavior, look for your cursor.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note6"></a>Note</h3><p>As you will see when working with Blender, most shortcuts will trigger the same type of action, but for different data types. For instance, selection shortcuts will help you with video editing and also creating 3D Models.</p></div><p>Once you hit the <strong class="userinput"><code>Movie</code></strong> option in the menu, you will see a big window in Blender asking you to locate the video file. On the left-hand side of your screen, you will see some options that you might want to review before importing (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.8</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/86805230-5d91-444a-813e-b66a938c4d86.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.8: Video import options</p><p>From top to bottom, here are the options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Relative Path</code></strong>: Since a movie file is an external resource for Blender, it will need a path to locate the file. The recommendation here is to save your Blender project in a folder and copy all media files there for consistency. If you leave this option enabled, Blender will try to make a relative path to the video file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Start Frame</code></strong>: The place in your timeline where Blender will place the video file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Replace Selection</code></strong>: If you have an existing video strip selected in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>, Blender will replace that video with the selected file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Sound</code></strong>: Do you need the audio from your video? If you <span>want</span><a id="id326345954" class="indexterm"></a> the video and no sound, disable this option.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><strong class="userinput"><code>Use Movie Framerate</code></strong>: Here is an important option! You will have to match the frame rate of your video to Blender's timeline. Otherwise, you might have problems with the playback. By marking this option, Blender will try to make the adjustments for you.</li></ul></div><p>Some of those options need your attention before you import anything to Blender, such as the suggestion to save your Blender file in a folder and copy all the media you will use to that same place to keep relative paths.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip7"></a>Note</h3><p>Once you get media in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>, you can press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ Space bar button to play back any content. If you press the same keys again, it will pause the playback.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec1"></a>Matching video footage frame rate</h4></div></div></div><p>Before you start any project related to video in Blender, you should take a look at your video source technical details, to match them in Blender. One of the aspects that you need to identify is the frame rate.</p><p>The frame rate is the speed in which all still frames from a <span>video</span><a id="id326345993" class="indexterm"></a> will play. Nowadays, you will find several different types of frame rates for a video—24, 30, 48, and 60 are the most used.</p><p>To avoid any potential problems, you must match the frame rate of your video sources to Blender's internal frame rate. For instance, if making a video with your smartphone using  <code class="literal">30</code> FPS, which is <span>the</span><a id="id326346044" class="indexterm"></a> abbreviation for <span class="strong"><strong>Frames Per Second</strong></span>, you must change Blender settings to match.</p><p>In Blender, you must go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Render</code></strong> Tab in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Properties</code></strong> window (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.9</em></span>). Look at the <strong class="userinput"><code>Frame Rate</code></strong> setting and change it to a value matching your video footage:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/8e5c2eb6-f62a-452d-991b-e3d9f9d5ce1e.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.9: Frame rate settings</p><p>Using the <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong> workspace will give you quick access to that window.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip8"></a>Note</h3><p>You can create as many workspaces as you want to keep access to information and properties across Blender windows. Even if you open a <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Editing</code></strong> workspace, it would be a great idea to keep the <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong> tab available.</p></div><p>What happens if you don't match the frame rate? If you forget to match the value, you will experience playback issues related to speed. For instance, if you have a video file using <code class="literal">60</code> FPS and Blender is set to use <code class="literal">24</code> FPS, your playback speed will be slower than the video.</p><p>As a result, you will see a slow-motion <span>version</span><a id="id326388918" class="indexterm"></a> of your footage. The opposite also applies, where you might have video footage in <code class="literal">24</code> FPS and using anything higher will speed up the video playback.</p><p>On the other hand, you might want to use Blender to create original content for a video such as an infographic or animation. For the cases where you don't have video footage to work, it is essential to set a frame rate for the whole project and stick to that value for all available resources.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec2"></a>Video container compatibility</h4></div></div></div><p>Working with video files can be a <span>challenging</span><a id="id326388940" class="indexterm"></a> task if you don't have all the required software to read the data. The problem is that a video file, also known as a container, is a type of file that has two parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Video</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio</li></ul></div><p>Each of those data types could come in a compressed or uncompressed format. Usually, a camera or video exporting software will apply some compression to the data to reduce their size.</p><p>How big is an uncompressed video file? The exact size will depend on several factors, but you can estimate:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>FullHD Video (1920 x 1080) at 24 FPS</strong></span>: 445 GB for 1 hour of video or 127 MB/Second</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>FullHD Video (1920 x 1080) at 60 FPS</strong></span>: 742 GB for 1 hour of video or 211 MB/Second</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>4K Video (3840 x 2160) at 24 FPS</strong></span>: 1.33 TB for 1 hour of video or 380 MB/Second</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>4K Video (3840 x 2160) at 60 FPS</strong></span>: 3.33 TB for 1 hour of video or 950 MB/Second</li></ul></div><p>With such large sizes, it is easy to understand why most video captured with smartphones or consumer cameras has compression. The compression software used for video and audio is what we call the CODEC. It is the same principle as when you get a ZIP file in your email and have to extract the file to get the contents.</p><p>If you have a video container, you need the CODEC to both read and compress video and audio files.</p><p>What is the best CODEC? There are several options in the market, but for digital video for YouTube or the web, it would be wise to follow some standards. For instance, using H.264 for video and AAC for audio are the recommendations from YouTube in an MP4 (MPEG-4) container.</p><p>The good news is that Blender supports MP4 video containers using H.264 and ACC for reading and exporting!</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec3"></a>Data compression types</h4></div></div></div><p>Another important aspect <span>about</span><a id="id326389047" class="indexterm"></a> a CODEC is the type of compression it applies to data. There are two types of compression available:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lossy compression</strong></span>: Here we have a process that <span>tries</span><a id="id326389065" class="indexterm"></a> to exclude unnecessary data to <span>save</span><a id="id326389074" class="indexterm"></a> on file size. As a result, files are usually smaller.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lossless compression</strong></span>: Some compression types <span>will</span><a id="id326403662" class="indexterm"></a> try to shrink data with no <span>data</span><a id="id326403671" class="indexterm"></a> loss, resulting in larger files but with all data intact.</li></ul></div><p>Which one is the compression from an H.264 file? It uses lossy compression, the same that you will also find in a JPEG image file.</p><p>That means you must avoid processing the video data as much as possible because, every time you treat the data, your CODEC will try to exclude something to shrink down your file.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec4"></a>Adjusting the Sequencer zoom and time code</h4></div></div></div><p>Now that you know more about <span>video</span><a id="id326403691" class="indexterm"></a> containers and compression, we can focus on adding that data to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong> of Blender. Once you go to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> menu and choose the <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Movie</span><a id="id326403707" class="indexterm"></a></code></strong> option, pick any MP4 that you want and import it to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>.</p><p>After you import the data, you will start to see a video strip, which is the name Blender uses to identify video data in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.10</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/f7ee2265-a19a-4132-8059-6a54bb32255c.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.10: Video strip</p><p>You probably will start with a limited view of your video file like the one from <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.10</em></span>. Several tools will help you manipulate the zoom or viewing of channels.</p><p>The most convenient is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Home</em></span> key on your keyboard. If you press this key, Blender will fit all video strips in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong> window.</p><p>For more <span>zoom</span><a id="id326404103" class="indexterm"></a> controls, you can hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl </em></span><strong class="userinput"><code>+</code></strong> middle mouse <span>button</span><a id="id326404117" class="indexterm"></a> and move your cursor. If you move up and down, you will adjust the zoom vertically, and going from left to right will adapt it horizontally.</p><p>In longer videos, you will probably want to get a broader view of your channels, like the one shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.11</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/242f0e3b-7c68-4504-8583-42cff35cb25b.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.11: Channels with a broader view</p><p></p><p>Another aspect of the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong> that you will probably want to change is the time code. In case Blender doesn't display seconds as time code, you can enforce that in the <strong class="userinput"><code>View</code></strong> menu.

It will have a number, a plus sign, and another number. It might look like <strong class="userinput"><code>0+00</code></strong>. What does it mean?</p><p>Since Blender won't display fractions of a second, it will show the corresponding video seconds plus the frames.

For instance, you will see the length of a strip and the source name (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.13</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/c50ae6f1-71c0-4226-a985-f544aa88199d.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.13: Strip selection</p><p>After selecting a strip, you can duplicate the content using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> keys. Just press the keys, and you will be able to create a copy of a selected strip. When you press the keys, it will be possible to slide the copy somewhere else in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>. Just move the cursor and left- click at the location you want to place your copied strip.</p><p>For the times where you have multiple strips in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>, a few shortcuts will help you manage selection:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + right-click: Add or remove strips to/from selection (for various picks)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> Key: Select all strips in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>: Remove all strips from the selection</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span>: Invert the selection of strips</li></ul></div><p>In case you want to make a more extensive selection, you can also use the <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> key to draw a box around any given number of strips. Using the left mouse button, click and drag to draw a box (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.14</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/c1a3940d-b25e-4191-8aad-f1819687e252.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.14: Strips selection</p><p>One of the benefits of using Blender is the consistency about shortcuts, because you will also be able to use all those options for all other parts of <span>the</span><a id="id326107557" class="indexterm"></a> software. For instance, using <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + right-click will also help you with a selection of objects in 3D modeling or editing animation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec8"></a>Transforming video strips</h3></div></div></div><p>Since your video strips are just 2D objects, we don't <span>need</span><a id="id326107576" class="indexterm"></a> the full range of transformations Blender uses for modeling. Instead, we will only work with the move transformation. To move your strip anywhere in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key with any given number of selected strips.</p><p>After pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key, you can move your mouse to relocate the strips, even between channels (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.15</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/a14b0a10-a6c0-4f72-a213-00e9c772644e.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.15: Moving strips</p><p>Blender will also display the start and end frames of a strip to help you relocate the video.</p><p>In some cases, you can even change some strips, length using the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> Key. Look at the beginning and end of any strip, and you will see two triangles pointing to the center. They work as location controls. To select them, you can right-click on the triangle, and by pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key, you will be able to change only the start or end frames (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.16</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/8e7274d2-371e-485c-9b5a-9b246fdb69a4.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.16: Strip length</p><p>Use this option with caution on strips with video and audio, because you might either cut or create some blank space. There are other ways to change a strip length. The <span>triangles</span><a id="id326107644" class="indexterm"></a> will work best to set width for static content such as images, text, and effects.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec9"></a>Saving a video project</h3></div></div></div><p>How do you save a video project in Blender? To keep your <span>source</span><a id="id326107660" class="indexterm"></a> files and project saved for future reference and updates, you should always save the project. How does Blender handle video files?</p><p>Before we discuss how Blender deals with video files, you can save any project by going to the <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> menu and choosing <strong class="userinput"><code>Save As...</code></strong> like most other tools.</p><p>It will create a file with a <code class="literal">.blend</code> extension. The file will feature all animation and <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong> data, but none of the external files, unless you explicitly ask Blender to incorporate them into the project.</p><p>For instance, suppose you have a project containing two external video files named <code class="literal">video1.mp4</code> and <code class="literal">video2.mp4.</code> The first thing you should do is to create a folder in your system to store all the files for that project. Copy all important media to that folder.</p><p>In Blender, save the <code class="literal">.blend</code> file to that folder. Once you import the footage to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Sequencer</code></strong>, you will be able to have relative paths to the media. It would be something like <code class="literal">\video1.mp4</code> and not a full system address.</p><p>Why is that important? Because, with relative paths to media files, you can open the project anywhere without any broken links. It will be possible to place the project on network drives or flash storage to move it around.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec5"></a>Embedding media to Blender files</h4></div></div></div><p>Another option you should <span>consider</span><a id="id326214013" class="indexterm"></a> is to embed the media to Blender files. To achieve that, you must <span>use</span><a id="id326214022" class="indexterm"></a> an option from the <strong class="userinput"><code>File</code></strong> menu in the <strong class="userinput"><code>External Data</code></strong> group. There you will find an option called <strong class="userinput"><code>Pack All into .blend</code></strong> to add all media to the project file (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1.17</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/03ba1092-9aeb-4841-af3f-b109f89fbf4b.png" /></div><p>Figure 1.17: External Data options</p><p>After using this option, you will have all video footage, audio, and images attached to the blend file. You won't have to worry about any folders or missing links.</p><p>The downside of using such an option is the file size. You might end up with a blend file of a few gigabytes in size. To extract the <span>contents</span><a id="id326214062" class="indexterm"></a> of a blend file that has <span>embeded</span><a id="id326214071" class="indexterm"></a> media, use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Unpack All into Files</code></strong> option from the same menu.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"></a>Note</h3><p>If you don't mind about the file size, use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Automatically Pack into .blend</code></strong> to make Blender add all external media to the project file. No matter if it is in the same folder, you will have all external media attached to the project.</p></div></div></div></div>
