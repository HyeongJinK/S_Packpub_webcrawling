When you work on that type of production, you will see that people will make pauses or interrupt the discussion in several other ways.</p><p>In the end, you will have unedited and raw footage with half an hour of material, which you have to cut and edit until it gets to only 10 minutes.</p><p>That is when you will need to use tools to cut, edit, and reorder video footage. In Blender, you will find all those options in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Video Sequencer</code></strong>. Since you already know how to use and get footage to the sequencer, we can move forward and edit video footage.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"></a>Using the cut tools for video</h3></div></div></div><p>A popular tool in any video editing <span>software</span><a id="id326214148" class="indexterm"></a> is the cut option, where you can get <span>any</span><a id="id326214156" class="indexterm"></a> video and split the material into two parts. If you have a video strip in the sequencer, you can also use a similar tool to cut any footage.</p><p>Before we proceed, you should have any video footage in your sequencer to use the cut tool successfully.</p><p>Once you have a video strip in your sequencer, you will be able to cut the material. Blender has two options for cutting video:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Hard cut</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Soft cut</li></ul></div><p>The option to activate the cut is in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Strip</code></strong> menu shown here (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.1</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/2097fcbe-134e-432a-af9c-27752a287489.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.1: Cut options</p><p>To cut a video in the sequencer, you must select it first.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"></a>Note</h3><p>You can also use a shortcut for both cuts with the <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span> key (hard cut) and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span> keys (soft cut).</p></div><p><span>So what</span> is the difference between a hard cut and a soft cut?</p><p>Although both options will cut a video strip, you will get a unique resultant <strong class="userinput"><code>Strip</code></strong> based on your cut choice. The difference is in the handles at the beginning and end of a strip, which are the two triangles pointing to the center.</p><p>If you have an uncut strip that has about 30 seconds of video and use your end handle to extend the length of your footage, Blender will copy the last frame and use it to fill the additional time. The same will happen if you try to extend your strip from the beginning.</p><p>That is what will happen to a strip if you use a hard cut (<span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>K</em></span> keys).</p><p>By going with a soft cut, you will get the option to extend the length of a resultant strip, using the full footage and not a still frame. Look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.2</em></span> to see how a soft cut works:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/3b1d6174-6a78-4059-88e1-2ee3e6d14800.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.2: Soft cut</p><p>It is almost like a mask <span>that</span><a id="id326228366" class="indexterm"></a> Blender applies to the strip, which will <span>hide</span><a id="id326228375" class="indexterm"></a> the undesired parts of your video.</p><p>Using a soft cut will enable you to rethink and rework any possible cut you made to a video. If you need more or less from the footage, using the handles and the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key will give you the flexibility to change your cut later.</p><p>After you cut a strip, you can select the resultant part and either remove it from your sequencer or relocate the content using the <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> key.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"></a>Note</h3><p>Having a strip from a soft cut will enable you to later get additional parts of footage with no need to import it again. Just select an existing strip, and using <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span> to duplicate the material, you can use the handles to expand the content.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"></a>Using markers to help edit video</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the tasks you will <span>want</span><a id="id326228621" class="indexterm"></a> to perform before making a cut in a video is to <span>watch</span><a id="id326228630" class="indexterm"></a> and look for the exact locations where you will split each strip. To find the exact locations, you will have to watch and set key points in your sequencer.</p><p><span>Blender</span> has a tool called marker that might help you locate critical points in a video. The process to add a marker is simple and consists of the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Triggering the play in your sequencer with either the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ Space bar keys or the play icon in your <strong class="userinput"><code>Timeline</code></strong> window.</li><li>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ Space bar again to pause in the location you wish to add a marker.

All of a sudden your playback might stop before it gets to the end of your video.</p><p>How do we fix that? Although it may sound like a problem, it is a default behavior from Blender.</p><p>Blender will always start a file using a default length for your sequencer, based on the frames set for animation.</p><p>Look at the bottom lower-right of your <strong class="userinput"><code>Timeline</code></strong> window, and you will see two numeric values for <strong class="userinput"><code>Start</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong>, respectively <strong class="userinput"><code>1</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>250</code></strong> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.6</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/6682ca66-7ecf-4c6f-8601-5b60a10fc2ef.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.6: Start and End frames</p><p>You will have to change these numbers every time you have a new project. Assuming you are using a frame rate of 30 FPS and you have video footage of <span>30</span> seconds, you will need a total of <strong class="userinput"><code>900</code></strong> frames (30 seconds x 30 FPS = 900).</p><p>Set the <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>900</code></strong> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.7</em></span>), and you will be able to play the animation until the end:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/6e42e748-59be-46b4-95ca-c9f6b8cc83a5.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.7: End frame</p><p>If you don't change this option, Blender will only play back and export the project until the default <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> frame, which is <strong class="userinput"><code>250</code></strong>.</p><p>Eventually, you will need to <span>change</span><a id="id326346052" class="indexterm"></a> the <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> settings a few times along the editing process of a project. The reason for this is that you might start with a particular number of frames, and after cutting some footage you will shorten the overall length.</p><p>For instance, our footage with <strong class="userinput"><code>900</code></strong> frames might receive a few cuts and have a reduced length set to <strong class="userinput"><code>750</code></strong>. When that happens, you should change the <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> value to match the new range. By doing that, you will ensure a preview of only your final cut and also prepare the project for exporting.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec6"></a>Using the preview range</h4></div></div></div><p>In some cases, you may have a <span>long</span><a id="id326346084" class="indexterm"></a> video project that has five minutes or more of content. If you hit <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + Space bar to preview the editing process, you would end up watching the full length.</p><p>What if you want to preview a small range of the video? Blender has an option called preview range that could help.</p><p>The tool works by limiting the <strong class="userinput"><code>Start</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> frames in your preview only and doesn't change the <strong class="userinput"><code>Start</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> frames from the whole project.</p><p>To create a preview range, you can use the <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> key in the sequencer, and draw a square that marks the area where you want to limit your preview. Once you limit the preview, you will see two vertical lines showing the range (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.8</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/28511d9e-bb39-44e4-96cf-a8d5d7438bbd.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.8: Preview range</p><p>If you trigger the playback of <span>your</span><a id="id326389047" class="indexterm"></a> sequencer, Blender will only show what's inside the range.

There you will see the Blender file picker. Choose a single file to use it as a video strip.</p><p>In the sequencer, you will see both handlers for the <strong class="userinput"><code>Start</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>End</code></strong> of your image strip. The controls and options to manipulate that image are the same from a video (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.9</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/6b000cc7-106f-487e-a284-858f2a15afa1.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.9: Image strip</p><p>Besides getting a single image as a strip, you can also use sequences of images and turn them to video. That will come in handy when you have a series of images you shot with a smartphone and want to convert them to video.</p><p>To import a sequence of images, you will follow the same steps, with a small difference. When you have the file picker window in Blender, you must select multiple photos. If you have the filenames as a sequence, Blender will set them in order.</p><p>How do you select multiple files? You can hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> key and right-click on each file or use the <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> key to draw a box around all the files you need.

A task that might consume a lot of time is the alignment of strips. After a few cuts of a long strip, you will have a lot of blank space in your sequencer, like the one shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.10</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/36a77524-ba60-47a9-848c-cb07341e6d9b.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.10: Blank space between strips</p><p>Using a tool called Snap, you can easily align those strips with the playback head in Blender. The Snap will get a selected strip and align the start frame with the location of your playback head.</p><p>How does that work? Simple, you will place the vertical blue line anywhere in your sequencer and select any strip. Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> keys and the strip will jump to the location. The starting frame of your selected strip will align with the playback head (<span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 2.11</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789804959/graphics/bb9b0df8-5295-40df-9388-4fd951877cd0.png" /></div><p>Figure 2.11: Snap tool</p><p>If you want to use <span>existing</span><a id="id326411162" class="indexterm"></a> strips for the alignment, a shortcut <span>might</span><a id="id326411171" class="indexterm"></a> become invaluable.
