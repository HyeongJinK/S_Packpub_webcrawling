But instead of getting all the data from a project and rendering straight to video, you may want to get it as an image sequence first.</p><p>The reason to use image sequences in Blender for video is that it might save you some time and work as a backup. For projects that require multiple parts such as an intro and several scenes, you can start making image sequences whenever possible.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip46"></a>Note</h3><p>If your project doesn't require immediate use of audio, you can always render image sequences first.</p></div><p>We can use as an example the intro created in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Intro Videos for YouTube Text and Motion Graphics</em></span>. You can export that animation as an image sequence, and add the audio later.</p><p>Having the animation as a sequence of images will bring the following benefits:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Backup</strong></span>: You will protect the render from potential crashes. When you render hundreds of frames, and your computer crashes in the middle of the process, you can pick it up from the last frame. Rendering a video would require you to start from scratch.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File compression and quality</strong></span>: Using a sequence of PNG files will get you the best possible image quality with lossless compression. You can render the image sequence again to output multiple combinations of compression and keep all original image files.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span>: When rendering from an image sequence, you will notice that your computer will process the project with high speed. It is only processing images now.</li></ul></div><p>How do you create image sequences? Just pick PNG as the output format and choose a folder. Blender will render the Sequencer results as a series of images in that same folder.</p><p>Later, you can <span>add</span><a id="id325728724" class="indexterm"></a> the images to the Sequencer by using the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Image</code></strong><span>option</span><a id="id325731128" class="indexterm"></a> and choosing all images with the <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> key.</p><p>Use the video output as an MP4 only for the final project where all the assets and footage are in place. For the shorter parts, you can use image sequences for optimization purposes.</p></div>
