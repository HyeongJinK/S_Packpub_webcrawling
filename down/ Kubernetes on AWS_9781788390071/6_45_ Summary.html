Don't let the depth and breadth of the options and choices to make put you off, as Kubernetes is remarkably easy to get started with, especially on AWS.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will move to the practical work of getting a cluster set up and ready for work. We won't be able to cover all of the options, let alone all of the add-ons and additional tools that the community around Kubernetes has produced, but we will provide a stable starting point from which you can begin to implement your own plans.</p><p>Hopefully, this chapter will serve as a guide for you and your team to discuss and plan a cluster that meets the needs of your organization. You can then start to implement the features and functionality that you may have identified while reading this chapter.</p><p>If there is one single thing to remember when launching your own cluster: keep it simple, silly. Kubernetes makes it simple to add new tools to your arsenal whenever you need, so don't over-complicate or over-engineer too fast. Start with the simplest setup that can possibly work, even if you think you need to add complexity later; often, you will discover that the simple solution works just fine.</p><p>Take advantage of the fact that Kubernetes itself will allow you to rapidly evolve your infrastructure, and start small and add features and tools to your system when you need them, and not before!</p></div>
