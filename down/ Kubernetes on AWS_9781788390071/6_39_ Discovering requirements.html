When gathering the functional requirements <span>for</span><a id="id325268229" class="indexterm"></a> your cluster, it can <span>help</span><a id="id325268235" class="indexterm"></a> to categorize which requirements imply some consideration of these properties.</p><p>It is important to understand <span>that</span><a id="id325750930" class="indexterm"></a> it might not be possible to optimize for all three properties without making some trade-offs. For example, for applications that depend on very high network performance, AWS provides a tool called a cluster placement group. This ensures that the best network performance is available by provisioning the EC2 VMs in such a way that fast network interconnections are available between them (presumably by locating them in close proximity within an AWS data center). By provisioning instances this way, the highest network throughputs (above 5 GB) and lowest latencies can be achieved between machines within the cluster placement group. For some applications that require these levels of performance, this might be a worthwhile optimization.</p><p>However, since EC2 instances within a cluster placement group cannot span multiple availability zones, reliability of such a setup might be lower, since underlying power or connectivity issues could conceivably affect all the instances in a particular zone, especially if they are deployed in order to maximize interconnect speed. If your application doesn't have a requirement on such high-performance networking, it would indeed be unwise to trade reliability for greater performance.</p><p>Overarching these properties is a very important property for a production systemâ€”<span class="strong"><strong>observability</strong></span>. Observability <span>really</span><a id="id325750949" class="indexterm"></a> describes the ability for cluster operators to understand what is happening to your applications. Without being able to understand if your applications are performing and behaving as they should, you cannot evaluate, improve, and evolve the design of the system. When designing your cluster, this is the important feedback loop that allows you to maintain and improve your cluster based on operational experience. If you don't consider observability when planning your cluster, it can be much harder to debug issues with the cluster itself and with your applications.</p><p>When we are discussing application requirements at a planning stage, it can be hard to understand what the requirements of your applications will be. Having good observability into the performance of your cluster, the underlying hardware, and the applications running on top of it, lets you make pragmatic decisions and be flexible enough to make changes to support your applications as you discover more about how they behave under production workloads and as their functionality is developed over time.</p><p>Finally, perhaps the most important property to consider is security. Leaving the security of your cluster to the end of the planning process is a mistake. Remember that although security alone won't lead to the success of your project, failure to secure your cluster could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p>Recent studies and disclosures have shown that unsecured Kubernetes clusters have already become an attractive target to those who would exploit your computing power for the likes of cryptocurrency mining and other nefarious purposes, not to mention the potential of access to your cluster being used to access sensitive data held within your organization.</p><p>Security should be considered and monitored throughout the life cycle of your cluster; indeed, you should try and understand the security implications of each and every other requirement. You will need to consider how members of your organization <span>need</span><a id="id325750970" class="indexterm"></a> to interact with Kubernetes, as well as having a plan to ensure that you secure the configuration and software of your cluster and the applications that you run on it.</p><p>In the following sections of this chapter, we will introduce some ideas to help you understand the considerations that you might need to take with regard to these properties. Hopefully, this chapter should give you enough understanding to discover what your requirements are, and to begin planning your cluster for production. For the specific knowledge you will need to implement your plan, keep reading; the second half of this book is almost entirely focused on the practical knowledge you will need to implement your plans.</p></div>
