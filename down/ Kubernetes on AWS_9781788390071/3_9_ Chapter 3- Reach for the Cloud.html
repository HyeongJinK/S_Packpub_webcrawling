In order to learn how Kubernetes works, we are going to manually launch the EC2 instances that will form this first cluster and manually install and configure the Kubernetes components.</p><p>The cluster that we will build is suitable for you to use when learning about managing Kubernetes and for developing applications that can run on Kubernetes. With these instructions, we are aiming to build the simplest possible cluster that we can deploy to AWS. Of course, this does mean that there are some things that you will want to do differently when building a cluster of mission-critical applications. But don't worry—there are three chapters in Part 3 - Ready for Production where we cover everything you need to know to get your cluster ready for even the most demanding applications.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"></a>Note</h3><p>Running a Kubernetes cluster on AWS costs money. The configuration we will cover in our instructions (a basic cluster with one master and one worker node) at the time of writing will cost around US 75 dollars a month. So if you are just using your cluster for experimentation and learning, remember to shut the instances down when you are finished for the day.
If you have finished with the cluster, terminate the instances and make sure that the EBS volumes have been deleted, because you will pay for these storage volumes even if the instances they are attached to have been stopped.</p></div><p>This chapter is designed to be a learning experience, so read through and type out the commands as you read them. If you have the e-book version of this book, then resist the urge to copy and paste, as you will learn more if you type out the commands and take some time to understand what you are doing. There are tools that will do everything this chapter covers and more just by running one command, but hopefully building your first cluster manually, step by step, will give you some valuable insight into what is required to make a Kubernetes cluster tick.</p></div>
