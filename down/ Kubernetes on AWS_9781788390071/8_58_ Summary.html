It is important that you learn how to allocate resources to your pods by setting the correct resource limits and requests; if you don't, your applications can become unreliable or starved of resources.</p><p>By understanding how Kubernetes assigns Quality of Service classes to your pods based on the resource requests and limits that you assign them, you can have precisely control how your pods are managed. By ensuring your critical applications, such as web servers and databases, run with the Guaranteed class, you can ensure that they will perform consistently and suffer minimal disruption when pods need to be rescheduled. You can improve the efficiency of your cluster by setting limits on lower-priority pods that will result in them being scheduled with the Burstable QoS class. Burstable pods can use extra resources when they are available but won't need extra capacity to be added to the cluster when load increases.</p><p>Resource quotas can be invaluable when managing a large cluster that is used to run several applications, and even by different teams in your organization, especially if you are trying to control the cost of non-production workloads, such as testing and staging environments.</p><p>AWS calls its machines elastic for a reason: they can be scaled up or down in a matter of minutes to meet the demands of your applications. If you run workloads on a cluster where the load is variable, then you should make use of these properties and the tools that Kubernetes provides to scale your deployments to match the load that your applications are receiving, and your cluster to the size of the pods that need to be scheduled.</p></div>
