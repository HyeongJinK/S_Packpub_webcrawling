By running our applications on Kubernetes, we have a number of tools at our disposal to simplify their operation, and for making them more reliable, resilient to errors, and, ultimately, highly available.</p><p>In order for us to depend on some of the guarantees and behaviors that our applications can inherit from Kubernetes, it is important that we understand how Kubernetes behaves, and some of the factors that have an impact on a production system.</p><p>It is important as a cluster administrator that you have an understanding of the requirements of the applications you are running, and of the users of those applications.</p><p>Having an awareness of the way that Kubernetes behaves in production is key, so it is invaluable to gain some practical experience of running your applications on Kubernetes before you start to serve mission-critical traffic. For example, when GitHub migrated their main application to Kubernetes, they started by moving traffic for internal users to their new Kubernetes-based infrastructure, before switching their main production traffic.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"The load from internal users helped us find problems, fix bugs, and start getting comfortable with Kubernetes in production. During this period, we worked to increase our confidence by simulating procedures we anticipated performing in the future, writing runbooks, and performing failure tests."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>—Jesse Newland (<a class="ulink" href="https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/" target="_blank">https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/</a>)</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>While I can cover some of the things that you are likely to encounter when using Kubernetes on AWS in production, it is important to understand that every application and organization is unique in surprising ways. You should think of Kubernetes as a toolkit that will enable you to build a powerful and flexible environment for your organization. Kubernetes isn't a magic bullet that removes the need for operational expertise; it's a tool that assists you in managing your applications.</p></div>
