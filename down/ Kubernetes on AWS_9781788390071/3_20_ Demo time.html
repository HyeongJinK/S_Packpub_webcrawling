You should by now have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster that you can use to experiment with and explore Kubernetes more fully.</p><p>Let's demonstrate that the cluster we have built is working by deploying an application to our cluster, as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>kubectl apply -f</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Kubernetes-on-AWS/master/chapter03/demo.yaml</strong></span></pre><p>This manifest deploys a simple web application and a service to expose the application to the internet using a load balancer. We can view the public DNS name of the load balancer by using the <code class="literal">kubectl get service</code> command, as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&gt; kubectl get svc demo -o wide</strong></span></pre><p>Once you have the public address of the load balancer, you might need to wait for a few moments before the address starts to resolve. Visit the address in your browser; you should see a screen like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788390071/graphics/836ff37a-5afc-424f-b4ef-02e8c19ba8cd.png" /></div></div>
