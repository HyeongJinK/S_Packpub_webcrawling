Your cluster is correctly configured to take advantage of the many integrations that Kubernetes has with AWS.</p><p>While there are many tools that can automate and assist you in the task of building and managing a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, hopefully by learning how to approach the task from scratch, you will have a better understanding of the networking and computing resources needed to support a Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>In <span>Part 3</span>, we will build on the knowledge from this chapter and discuss the additional components that you will need to add to a cluster to make it suitable for hosting production services. The cluster we have just built is a fully functional installation of Kubernetes. Read on as we look at the tools and techniques required to successfully operate production services on Kubernetes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will look at the tools and procedures you can adopt to manage deploying and updating your services effectively using Kubernetes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will look at the strategies and tools you can adopt to secure your cluster and the applications running on it</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will look at the tools typically used with Kubernetes for monitoring and log management</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will look at the best ways to architect your applications and your clusters in order to meet availability targets</li></ul></div></div>
