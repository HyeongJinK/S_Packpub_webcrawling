However, it does meet the following essential requirements for production readiness:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reliability</strong></span>: By using EKS, we have provisioned a reliable control plane that we can depend upon to manage our cluster.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scalability</strong></span>: By operating our nodes via an autoscaling group, we can make it simple to add extra capacity to our cluster in seconds.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Maintainability</strong></span>: By defining our infrastructure as code using Terraform, we have made it simple to manage our cluster in the future. By setting up a build process for the AMI used by our node machines, we are able to quickly rebuild the image to pull in security updates and updated versions of our node software.</li></ul></div></div>
