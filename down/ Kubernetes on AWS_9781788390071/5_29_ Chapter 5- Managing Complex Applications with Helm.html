For example, you might have a web application that displays information from a database that also uses a scheduled job to update that information on a regular basis. In order for this application to function correctly, both of these components need to be deployed and functioning correctly. Furthermore, these two components likely share some configuration, such as credentials for the backend database.</p><p>One other problem we might encounter when deploying applications to our Kubernetes cluster is one of reusability. Perhaps we need to run the same tool or application in multiple contexts or environments. For example, many organizations have a staging environment for testing new versions of software.</p><p>When maintaining multiple environments, we ideally want the configuration in each environment to match as closely as possible, but of course, some differences in configuration are required. Maintaining multiple copies of Kubernetes manifests for each of your environments can be error prone, and gives you no guarantees that an application that worked in one environment will work in another.</p><p>Helm is a popular tool in the Kubernetes ecosystem that solves these problems. It gives us a way of building packages (known as charts) of related Kubernetes objects that can be deployed in a cohesive way to a cluster. It also allows us to parameterize these packages, so they can be reused in different contexts and deployed to the varying environments that the services they provide might be needed in.</p><p>Like Kubernetes, development of Helm is overseen by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. As well as Helm (the package manager), the community maintains a repository of standard charts for a wide range of open source software you can install and run on your cluster. From the Jenkins CI server to MySQL or Prometheus, it's simple to install and run complex deployments involving many underlying Kubernetes resources with Helm.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to install the <code class="literal">helm</code> command-line tool</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to install Helm's in-cluster component, Tiller</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How you can deploy a service to your cluster using a community-maintained chart</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">About the syntax you will need to know when creating charts</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to host your own chart repository in order to share your charts within your organization, or more widely</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Strategies for integrating Helm charts into your own deployment processes</li></ul></div></div>
