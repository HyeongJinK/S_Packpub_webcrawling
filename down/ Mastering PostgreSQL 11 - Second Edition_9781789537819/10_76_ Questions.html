In other words: You cannot use streaming to upgrade from, say, PostgreSQL 10 to PostgreSQL 11 using a transaction log stream. Logical replication can help to bridge this gap. In addition to that logical replication can help to selectively replicate data to various systems.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What is the performance impact of synchronous replication?</strong></span></p><p>Synchronous replication will be slower than binary replication. In general the performance impact of short transactions will be a lot larger than for long transactions. It is hard to state a precise number as the performance decrease depends significantly on network latency. The slow your network - the slower your synchronous replication.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Why not always use synchronous replication?</strong></span></p><p>Try to use synchronous replication only when it is absolutely necessary to reduce the impact on speed and availability. In most cases asynchronous replication is perfectly fine and does exactly what is required by most applications. Use synchronous replication cautiously.</p></div>
