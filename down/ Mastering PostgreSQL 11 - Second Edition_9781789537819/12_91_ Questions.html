In addition to that, the user / administrator has access to a lot of external information about the operating system, hardware, user patterns and all that. A database engine cannot decide whether a user's query is pointless or not - it does not knows its purpose. Therefore, administrators and developers are always at an advantage over the database and are, therefore, necessary (and most likely always will be).Â </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Does PostgreSQL face corruption often?</strong></span></p><p>No. My company is providing services for thousands of companies. We rarely see cases of database corruption - and if there is corruption it is usually caused by hardware issues.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Does PostgreSQL need constant care?</strong></span></p><p>Usually not unless you are using the database in a suboptimal way. In general, PostgreSQL does a lot of stuff on its own and takes care of many things such as VACUUM and so on automatically.</p></div>
