After looking at mostly administration-related topics, the goal now is to aim at a broader topic. In the PostgreSQL world, many things are done through extensions. The advantage of extensions is that functionality can be added without bloating the PostgreSQL core. People can choose from sometimes-competing extensions and find what is best for them. The philosophy is to keep the core slim, relatively easy to maintain, and ready for the future.</p><p>In this chapter, some of the most widespread extensions for PostgreSQL will be discussed. However, before digging deeper into the issue, I want to state that this chapter only features a list of extensions that I personally find useful. There are so many modules out there these days that it is impossible to cover them all in a reasonable way. Stuff is published every day and it is sometimes even hard for a professional to be aware of everything out there. New extensions are being published as we speak, and it might be a good idea to take a <span>look</span><a id="id325957220" class="indexterm"></a> at PGXN (<a class="ulink" href="https://pgxn.org/" target="_blank"><span>https://pgxn.org/</span></a>), which contains a large variety of extensions for PostgreSQL.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How extensions work</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A selection of <code class="literal">contrib</code> modules</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A quick look at GIS-related modules</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Other useful extensions</li></ul></div><p>Note that only the most important extensions will be covered.</p></div>
