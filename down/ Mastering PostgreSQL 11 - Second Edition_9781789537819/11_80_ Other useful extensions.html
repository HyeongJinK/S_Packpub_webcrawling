However, the <span>packages</span><a id="id326012549" class="indexterm"></a> that we have seen are not the only ones available in the PostgreSQL community. There are many more packages that allow us to do all kinds of things.</p><p>Unfortunately, this chapter is too short to dig into everything that is currently out there. The number of modules is growing day by day and it is impossible to cover them all. Therefore, I only want to point out the ones I find the most important.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PostGIS</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://postgis.net/" target="_blank"><span>h</span><span>t</span><span>t</span><span>p</span><span>://</span><span>p</span><span>o</span><span>s</span><span>t</span><span>g</span><span>i</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>n</span><span>e</span><span>t</span><span>/</span></a>) is the <span class="strong"><strong>Geographical Information Systems</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GIS</strong></span>) database interface in the open source world. It has been adopted <span>around</span><a id="id326012490" class="indexterm"></a> the <span>globe</span><a id="id326012482" class="indexterm"></a> and is one of the de facto <span>standards</span><a id="id325565402" class="indexterm"></a> in the relational open source database world. It is a professional and extremely powerful solution.</p><p>If you are looking for geospatial routing, <code class="literal">pgRouting</code> is what you might be looking for. It offers various algorithms to find the best connections between locations and works on top of PostgreSQL.</p><p>In this chapter, we have already learned about the <code class="literal">postgres_fdw</code> extension, which allows us to connect to some other PostgreSQL databases. There are many more foreign data wrappers around. One of the most famous and most professional ones is the <code class="literal">oracle_fdw</code> extension. It allows you to integrate with Oracle and fetch data over the wire, as can be done with the <code class="literal">postgres_fdw</code> extension.</p><p>In some cases, you might also be interested in testing the stability of your infrastructure with <code class="literal">pg_crash</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_crash" target="_blank"><span>https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_crash</span></a>). The idea is to have a module <span>that</span><a id="id325565436" class="indexterm"></a> constantly crashes your database. <code class="literal">pg_crash</code> is an excellent choice for testing and debugging connection pools, and has the ability of an application to reconnect to a failing database. <code class="literal">pg_crash</code> will periodically run amok and kill database sessions or corrupt memory. It is ideal for long-term testing.</p></div>
