The important point is this: not all log entries are created equal. PostgreSQL has a hierarchy of log <span>entries</span><a id="id326472039" class="indexterm"></a> that range from <code class="literal">DEBUG</code> messages to <code class="literal">PANIC</code>.</p><p>For the administrator, the following three error levels are of great importance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">ERROR</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">FATAL</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">PANIC</code></li></ul></div><p><code class="literal">ERROR</code> is used for problems such as syntax errors, permission-related problems, and more. Your log will always contain error messages. The critical factor is thisâ€”how often does a certain type of error show up? Producing millions of syntax errors is certainly not an ideal strategy for running a database server.</p><p><code class="literal">FATAL</code> is more scary than <code class="literal">ERROR</code>; you will see messages such as <code class="literal">could not allocate memory for shared memory name or unexpected walreceiver state</code>. In other words, these error messages are already really scary and will tell you that things are going wrong.</p><p>Finally, there is <code class="literal">PANIC</code>. If you hit this kind of message, you know that something is really, really wrong. Classic examples of <code class="literal">PANIC</code> are lock table corrupted or too <span>many</span><a id="id326300499" class="indexterm"></a> semaphores created. These will result in a shutdown.</p></div>
