It really depends on how you are using the database and which features are most important to your application. Everybody has a personal favorite, however. In my case, it is the parallel index creation, which will be really important to customers running giant databases. Still, it is up to you to decide what you like mostÂ and what you don't like.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Does PostgreSQL 11 work on my platform?</strong></span></p><p>PostgreSQL 11 works on all common platforms, including but not limited to Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX, and macOS X. The community tries to cover as many platforms as possible so as not to exclude people from using PostgreSQL. For most common systems, PostgreSQL will even be prepackaged.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Did the license model change?</strong></span></p><p>No, nothing has changed and most likely nothing ever will.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>When can we expect PostgreSQL 12?</strong></span></p><p>Usually, a major release can be expected once a year. So the next major release of PostgreSQL 12 will be in the fall of 2019.</p></div>
