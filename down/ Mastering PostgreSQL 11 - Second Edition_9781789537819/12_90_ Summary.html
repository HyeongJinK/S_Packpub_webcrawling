We learned about some important system tables, as well as some other important factors that can determine whether we will succeed or fail.</p><p>In the final chapter of this book, we will focus our attention on migrating to PostgreSQL. If you are using Oracle or some other database system, you might want to check out PostgreSQL. In Chapter 13, <span class="emphasis"><em>Migrating to PostgreSQL</em></span>, will tell you how to do that.</p><p> </p></div>
