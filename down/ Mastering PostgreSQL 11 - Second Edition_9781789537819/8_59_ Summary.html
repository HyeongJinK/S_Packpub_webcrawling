Many things, such as SELinux, security definer/invoker, and so on, were left untouched. However, in this chapter, we learned the most common things that we will face as a PostgreSQL developer and DBA. We also learned about how to avoid the basic pitfalls and how to make our systems more secure.</p><p>In Chapter 9, <span class="emphasis"><em>Handling Backup and Recovery</em></span>, we will learn about PostgreSQL streaming replication and incremental backups. This chapter will also cover failover scenarios.</p></div>
