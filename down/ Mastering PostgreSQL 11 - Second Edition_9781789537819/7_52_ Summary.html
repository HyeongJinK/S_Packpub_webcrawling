After a theoretical introduction, our attention was focused on some selected features of PL/pgSQL. In addition to that, you learned how to use PL/Perl and PL/Python, which are simply two important languages provided by PostgreSQL. Of course, there are many more languages available. However, due to the limitations of the scope of this book, those could not be covered in detail.
