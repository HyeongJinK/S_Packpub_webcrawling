Locking is a vital concept for any kind of database. It is not enough to understand just how it works to write proper or better applications, it is also essential from a performance point of view. Without handling locks properly, your applications might not only be slow, they might also be wrong and behave in very unexpected ways. In my opinion, locking is the key to performance and having a good overview will certainly help. Therefore, understanding locking and transactions is important for administrators and developers alike.
