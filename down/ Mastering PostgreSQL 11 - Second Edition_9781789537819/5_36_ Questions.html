A full overview of what there is can be found in the official PostgreSQL documentation, which is available online at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/monitoring-stats.html" target="_blank">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/monitoring-stats.html</a>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How can I spot performance problems easily?</strong></span></p><p>There are various ways to detect performance problems in PostgreSQL. One way is to make use of <code class="literal">pg_stat_statements</code>. Other options are to use <code class="literal">auto_explain</code> or simply standard PostgreSQL log files. Depending on your needs, you can decide on which method is best for you. The following blog shows you how this kind of information can be extracted from the system: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/3-ways-to-detect-slow-queries-in-postgresql/" target="_blank">https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/3-ways-to-detect-slow-queries-in-postgresql/</a>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How does PostgreSQL write log files?</strong></span></p><p>PostgreSQL has various options to create logs. The most commonly used one is to simply create standard textual logs. However, you can also make use of syslog or the logging facilities provided by Windows (eventlog).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Does logging have an impact on performance?</strong></span></p><p>Actually, yes. If you are running many small queries and if you happen to write millions of lines of logs to the system, it can impact on performance.</p></div>
