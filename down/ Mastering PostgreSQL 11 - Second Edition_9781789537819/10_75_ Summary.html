We then learned about PITR, as well as replication slots. Note that a book on replication is never complete unless it spans around 400 pages or so, but we have learned the most important things that every administrator should know.</p><p>In Chapter 11, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deciding on Useful Extensions</em></span>, will be about useful extensions to PostgreSQL. We will learn about extensions that have been widely adopted by the industry and that provide even more functionality.</p></div>
