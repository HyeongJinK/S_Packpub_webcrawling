So far, only logical backups have been covered; I am about to change that in this chapter.</p><p>This chapter is all about PostgreSQL's transaction log and what we can do with it to improve our setup and to make things more secure.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What the transaction log does and why it is needed</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Performing point-in-time recovery</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up streaming replication</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Replication conflicts</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Monitoring replication</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Synchronous versus asynchronous replication</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding timelines</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Logical replication</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating subscriptions and publications</li></ul></div><p>At the end of this chapter, you will be able to set up transaction log archiving and replication. Keep in mind that this chapter can never be a comprehensive guide to replication; it is only a short introduction. Full coverage of replication would require around 500 pages. Just for a comparison, <span class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL Replication</em></span> by Packt Publishing alone is close to 400 pages.</p><p>This chapter will cover the most essential things in a more compact form.</p></div>
