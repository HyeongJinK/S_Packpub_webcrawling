In <code class="literal">postgresql.conf (listen_addresses)</code>, you can configure the bind addresses and open remote connections in general. In <code class="literal">pg_hba.conf</code>, you can tell PostgreSQL how to authenticate network connections. Depending on the IP range a request comes from, different rules can be applied. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What is a user and what is a role?</strong></span></p><p>Basically, the difference between a user and a role is academic. When creating a role the default value is <code class="literal">NOLOGIN</code>, which is not the case when you use <code class="literal">CREATE USER</code>. Otherwise, roles and users can be considered to be the same. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How can a password be changed?</strong></span></p><p>This is simple. You can use <code class="literal">ALTER USER</code> to do the job, as shown in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>test=# ALTER USER hs PASSWORD 'abc';</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>ALTER ROLE</strong></span></pre><p>Keep in mind that passwords are not necessarily stored in PostgreSQL. If you are using LDAP authentication or some other external method, the password stored in PostgreSQL won't be changed on the LDAP side.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What is row-level security?</strong></span></p><p>Row-level-security is a feature that allows you to limit the access of users to the content of a table. Here is an example: user <code class="literal">joe</code> might only be allowed to see women, while user <code class="literal">jane</code> is only allowed to see men. Row-level-security is therefore a mandatory filter that's applied on a table to limit the scope of a user for a table.</p></div>
