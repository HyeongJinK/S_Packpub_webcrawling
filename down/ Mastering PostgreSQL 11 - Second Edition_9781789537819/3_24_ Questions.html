If something is always good, it would be there by default. Indexes can speed up many operations but they can also slow down things considerably. The only rule is: Thing about what you are doing and what you are trying to achieve.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Does an index use a lot of space?</strong></span></p><p>It depends on the type of indexes. BRIN indexes are really small and fairly cheap, while other indexes usually need a lot more space. btrees for example are around 2.000 times bigger than btrees. Trigram based indexes are even larger in most cases.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How can I find missing indexes?</strong></span></p><p>The best way in my judgement is to take a look at <code class="literal">pg_stat_statements</code> and <code class="literal">pg_stat_user_tables</code>. Especially <code class="literal">seq_tup_read</code> is a really valuable column. If you are reading a really high number of rows, there might be an index missing. In general a deep look at the query is necessary what is really going on. In short: EXPLAIN is your friend under all circumstances.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Can indexes be built in parallel?</strong></span></p><p>Yes, since PostgreSQL 11 we have support for parallel index creation. It can speed up index creation considerably.</p></div>
