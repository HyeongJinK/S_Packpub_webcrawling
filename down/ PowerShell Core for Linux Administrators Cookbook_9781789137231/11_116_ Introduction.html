And, just like with Bash or sh, a PowerShell script is nothing but a series of instructions, along with some much-needed branching and looping. The pipeline makes handling data very simple from the moment you understand the concept of objects—this is the difference from the scripting framework available in Linux.</p><p>In this chapter, we will proceed with creating scripts that accept input at the terminal. Then, we will learn how to create functions so that we can leverage modularity as well as transfer objects between your functions and other functions, or even cmdlets.</p><p> </p></div>
