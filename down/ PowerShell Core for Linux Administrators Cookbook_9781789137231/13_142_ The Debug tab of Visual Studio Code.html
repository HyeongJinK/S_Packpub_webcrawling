Installing the PowerShell extension with Visual Studio Code enables all of the capabilities of the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment and more.</p><p>The Debug tab in Visual Studio Code helps you get under the hood and debug scripts. Get yourself a copy of Visual Studio Code and install the PowerShell extension to it by following the <span class="emphasis"><em>Installing Visual Studio Code</em></span> recipe in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Preparing for Administration Using PowerShell</em></span>.</p><p>The Debug panel can be accessed either by clicking on the Debug button on the sidebar or using the key combination <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>D.</em></span></p><p>The first thing you will notice in the Debug panel is the Run button, which is right next to a dropdown where you can select the launch configuration. We will use the default, <strong class="userinput"><code>PowerShell Launch Current File</code></strong>. These configurations can be seen and modified by clicking on the gear icon, which opens the <code class="literal">launch.json</code> file. Any configuration you add here will be shown as an option in the dropdown.</p><p>Next in the panel is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Variables</code></strong> pane. This pane shows all of the variables that have been created and used in the script so far, including the relevant automatic variables. These variables are shown as objects themselves, which means that any of their member properties are also shown in this view upon expanding the relevant variables. If you would like to keep an eye on specific variables, these can be added to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Watch </code></strong><strong class="userinput"><code>List</code></strong>. This would be helpful when debugging scripts so that you don't have to navigate a sea of variables. The values will change as required as we step through the code.</p><p>The next pane is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Call stack</code></strong> pane. This pane shows the call stack within the current script. Finally, there is the <strong class="userinput"><code>Breakpoints</code></strong> pane, which list out all the breakpoints set in the script. Very straightforward.</p></div>
