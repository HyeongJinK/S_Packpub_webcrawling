However, in some situations, it is necessary. Let's not leave such stones unturned, at least. In this recipe, we will ask the user for their name, and then display the greeting along with the date. Optionally, you can have a <span>space</span><a id="id326689054" class="indexterm"></a> in the name of the script.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec307"></a>How to do it…</h3></div></div></div><p>This is straightforward. If you are comfortable using command discovery, you can simply use <code class="literal">get-command *host</code> to get the information. Modify the script we created for the <span class="emphasis"><em>Writing a simple script</em></span> recipe to get the desired script:</p><pre class="programlisting">Get-Date

hostname

Write-Output "Hello, $(Read-Host "Enter your name")!"
# Verbose version: Write-Output "Hello, $(Read-Host -Prompt "Enter your name")!"</pre><p>That is all it is; run the script:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; &amp; './simple prompt script.ps1'</strong></span></pre></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec308"></a>How it works…</h3></div></div></div><p><code class="literal">Read-Host</code> takes input from the host, and then passes on the received object to the calling function. In our case, we have the <code class="literal">Read-Host</code> placed within a subexpression, and the caller is the <code class="literal">Write-Output</code> cmdlet. Therefore, it takes in the name as the input and then passes it on to the <code class="literal">Write-Output</code> cmdlet.</p><p>Optionally, if you are not comfortable using a subexpression, you can assign the value to a variable, and call the variable with <code class="literal">Write-Output</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">$Name = Read-Host "Enter your name"
Write-Output "Hello, $Name!"</pre></div></div>
