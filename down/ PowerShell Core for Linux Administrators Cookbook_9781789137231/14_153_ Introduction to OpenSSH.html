SSH</span><span> is a vital—and the</span> most valuable—tool in a <span>Linux system administrator's toolbox.</span></p><p><span>There's lots of SSH client software available on the market. This software is used </span><span>to set up a connection to an SSH server, and it is </span><span>available for all of the major <span>computer</span><a id="id325892253" class="indexterm"></a> operating systems.</span><span> </span><span>Linux distros have the SSH application built in,</span> and is accessible through Terminal. <span>Windows now has options available for testing the connection using a protocol named OpenSSH.<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>PowerShell is using SSH to build a connection and as a transport layer for remoting. This is standard SSH behavior.</span></p><p><span>Keep in mind that you can change settings while using SSH</span><span>that can prevent you from being able to log back in.</span><span>If you shut down a network interface,</span><span>commit incorrect network settings,</span><span>block the service with a firewall,</span><span>or shut down the SSH service,</span><span>you risk cutting off your own access. </span></p><p>And, of course, local and remote network conditions <span>can cause access problems.</span><span>If a computer allows remote access,</span> there needs to be a way to control who <span>can log in and work on the system.</span> With SSH, access is controlled either through the use of a username and password being set up by <span>an administrator on the remote server,</span> or a cryptographic key pair that's been generated by the <span>user and shared with the server.</span><span>Key-based access is the more secure option,</span><span>and as such it's increasingly common.</span></p><p>It's also the preferred way of accessing Linux servers on <span>many popular cloud services,</span><span>such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</span> SSH encrypts the connection between a client and the server so that information that's been sent back and forth is more secure than with <span>other types of remote access protocols,</span><span>such as FTP or Telnet.</span></p></div>
