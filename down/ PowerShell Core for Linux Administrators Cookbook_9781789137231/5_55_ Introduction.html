Although piping makes PowerShell highly versatile, they still cannot replace variables, because objects passed through the pipeline must be consumed immediately, and not all scripts work that way, given our varied requirements.</p><p>We are all aware of the various data types: <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">double</code>, <code class="literal">string</code>, <code class="literal">char</code>, <code class="literal">array</code>, and so on. Two other important types of variables in PowerShell are hashtables and objects. A hashtable is a dictionary table that's formed with key-value pairs. An object, as we have seen, could be as complex and as simple as it can get in PowerShell, that is, holding values of different kinds.</p><p>In PowerShell, objects can be stored in variables. For instance, check out the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; $Processes = Get-Process</strong></span></pre><p>Using this command would store all of the processes in the <code class="literal">$Processes</code> variable.</p><p> </p><p>One more point to remember with variables is the scope. By default, variables have a local scope, meaning that they are valid within the function that they are specified in. Global variables are valid across the program. In general, it is best practice to use local variables, though.</p><p>Global variables are declared and used with the <code class="literal">$Global:</code> prefix, such as <code class="literal">$Global:MyVariable</code>.</p></div>
