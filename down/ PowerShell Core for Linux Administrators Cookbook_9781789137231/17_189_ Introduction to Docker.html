It could be said that the concept came as a reaction to the it-works-on-my-machine issue, which is prevalent in every organization and deals with software development. Containerization aims at a few goals, such as the abstraction of libraries and the elimination of the hypervisor in order to improve application performance, scalability (scaling out), application portability, and so on. Docker popularized the concept of containerization.</p><p><span>Docker</span><a id="id325913505" class="indexterm"></a> containers pack everything that is needed to run a project: services, libraries, networking, storage, and code… it even packs protocols that the system needs to run the application. In other words, all of the dependencies that are required for an application to run are bundled into a single container so that there is no external dependency. Docker uses images. These can be thought of as snapshots that contain the specifications of the aforementioned entities that are required to run an application. Metaphorically, we could think of the Docker image as classes, and a container as an object instantiation of a Docker image process that runs on the Docker host. It is isolated from other running processes on the machine—just like creating one or more objects for a class.</p><p>Docker has a social community platform that allows you to share your images with others, or use a container that's been built by someone else but that meets the requirements of your application. This makes the Docker containers highly portable—theoretically, they run no matter where you throw them.</p><p>Developers typically update the container images during every version upgrade.</p><p>PowerShell is available as a <span>Docker</span><a id="id325909527" class="indexterm"></a> image as well. It runs on every Linux distribution that PowerShell supports, and Docker runs on. The Docker image is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/" target="_blank">https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/</a>. This aids in testing PowerShell on any Linux distribution that supports Docker, without having to install PowerShell first. Also, now that PowerShell is cross-platform, you could run the Docker image on multiple computers running different operating systems, and test your PowerShell scripts on all of them!</p><p>Before we try out the recipes, let's look at the different definitions pertaining to Docker:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A Docker image is the filesystem and application configuration used to create containers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A Docker container is the running instance of a Docker image</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A Docker daemon is the background service running on the host machine that manages Docker containers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A Docker client is the command-line interface that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A Docker Store is a registry of Docker images</li></ul></div><p> </p><p> </p></div>
