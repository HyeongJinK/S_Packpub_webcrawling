Typing out commands is much easier and faster than clicking around the screen. However, to someone who has just begun using the Terminal, it may not be so. Over time, as administrators grow more and more comfortable with the Terminal, they learn to configure it for speed and efficiency, much like training a horse. Further, most efficient administrators like automating several parts of their workflowâ€”customizing <code class="literal">.bashrc</code> and Vim scripts are examples of this. In this chapter, we will familiarize ourselves with the different consoles and tools that work with PowerShell, and will also look at a few simple recipes that would help customize our workspace, so that we can be more efficient.</p></div>
