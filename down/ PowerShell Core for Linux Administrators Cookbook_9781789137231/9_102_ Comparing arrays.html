In PowerShell, though, this task is as simple as passing two arguments to a cmdlet. In Linux, we have the <code class="literal">diff</code> tool to help us compare the contents of two files.</p><p>Imagine that you had an input file with 30 server names. One of the administrators in the team picked up the list and performed modifications to it by adding and removing a few server names. This list was not source-controlled. Luckily, the administrator did not replace the file, but created a new copy. You would like to review the file before approving the changes made. You want to see which servers were added and which were removed.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec274"></a>How to do it…</h3></div></div></div><p>PowerShell has a cmdlet for this task.
