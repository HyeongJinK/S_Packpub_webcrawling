The new design features allowed a certain degree of modernization and adaptation to the changing need of the growing market. In fact, the initial design is a clone from Unix/Linux Bash concepts, such as the pipe, aliases, and so on.</p><p>Working with files is arguably the most important part of being an IT pro, especially in the Linux environment, where everything is a file. This type of management helps with modularity, not to mention easy readability. Configuration files, so far, have been plain text and using them for administration has been about strings. PowerShell is a little ahead in this case: apart from handling simple files (which we call unstructured files), PowerShell can also handle structured files, and much better, because of its object-oriented nature. Structured files, such as JSON, are where PowerShell shines the most, because using them as objects is simple, straightforward, and efficient in PowerShell.</p><p>This chapter is all about working with files and directories. You will learn to read content from files, send output to files, and work with structured and unstructured files.</p><p>Â </p></div>
