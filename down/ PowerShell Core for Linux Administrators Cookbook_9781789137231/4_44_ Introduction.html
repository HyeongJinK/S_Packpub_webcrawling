In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>First Steps in Administration using PowerShell</em></span>, we looked at a few simple concepts such as working with dates and processes. In doing so, we learned a thing or two about using PowerShell as well, such as using it for measuring output objects.</p><p>In this chapter, we will learn to use something that makes PowerShell highly efficient and friendly: the pipeline.</p><p>Most Linux administrators would have used the pipeline in their shell commands or shell scripts, and most administrators who use any form of shell scripting would be aware that the pipe sends the output of one command as input to the next. It is also true in the case of Bash (and its derivatives) that the pipe sends text from the preceding command to the succeeding one.</p><p> </p><p>Most PowerShell cmdlets output objects, and the pipeline in PowerShell sends the output object to the next command. When we run a PowerShell command (and not a Linux command) in PowerShell, we get a table-like output in most cases. We may think that it is all of the output.</p><p>When we ask PowerShell to get any information, it pulls out the entire object in the background. This object (or a package that contains a lot of objects) is then processed using PowerShell's built-in formatting rules in order for it to be displayed on the host. To quote Microsoft:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>What you see onscreen is a summary of information, and not a complete representation of the output object.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Therefore, more often than not, what you see on the screen as the output of a certain command is just a tip of the iceberg! It's just that the submerged part was chosen not to be displayed based on the formatting rules. In this chapter, we will use the pipeline to get more from the objects than is displayed on the screen by default, and leverage the capability of the pipeline to get more out of PowerShell than meets the eye.</p></div>
