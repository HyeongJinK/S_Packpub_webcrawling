During the days of PowerShell ISE (which is still a thing in Windows PowerShell), debugging was not very intuitive. Today, we have Visual Studio Code, which proves to be a much better PowerShell scripting environment and has the necessary tools in its user interface.</p><p>It is important to mention at this point that if you are not using a Desktop Environment on your Linux system, you will need to stick with the debugging cmdlets. This chapter will point out those cmdlets as necessary so that you can use a code editor such as <code class="literal">Vim</code> and still be able to use the debugging tools without a graphical user interface.</p></div>
