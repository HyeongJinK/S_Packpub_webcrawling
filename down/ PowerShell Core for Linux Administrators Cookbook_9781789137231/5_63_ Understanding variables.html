It is time to take a break so that you can assimilate what you have learned. Later, experiment with different data types, create variables, see what type of objects they contain, and what members each object contains. We did not explicitly talk much about variables in this chapter, other than environment variables, but we used variables in almost every recipe. Ponder over (or, better yet, practically try out) these questions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>What can be assigned to a variable?</li><li>What does the variable contain—the entire object?</li><li>Can I refer to one single property of the object that a variable contains, if it contains the entire object?</li><li>Can I assign a certain member and not the entire object to a variable?</li><li>What if the member is a whole object in itself? (Hint: use <code class="literal">Get-Member</code> on the variable to find out.)</li><li>What happens when I use <code class="literal">Select-Object</code> with <code class="literal">-ExpandProperty</code> and assign the value to a variable? What type is the variable then?</li></ol></div><p>Finding out the answers to these questions will help you understand more about the variables, now that you have used them so much.</p></div>
