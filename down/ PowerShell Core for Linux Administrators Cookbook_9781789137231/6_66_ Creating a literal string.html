Having a textual <span>representation</span><a id="id325938643" class="indexterm"></a> of the world around us is arguably the most important invention of man. It is the same with modern computers as well—we started with textual programming and a text-based interface. Most programming today happens using text.</p><p>Closely related are strings. Bash is all string. Linux administration, so far, has been all string. Now, there is PowerShell. Is everything changing? No; PowerShell lets us work with strings just like the other shells do. There are some constraints with PowerShell, but those can be easily addressed using .NET accelerators related to strings. These are advanced concepts and rare scenarios, and, therefore, nothing to worry about.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec190"></a>How to do it…</h3></div></div></div><p>In this recipe, we will create a simple literal string. Is there a non-literal string? Yes, but we'll look at that one in the next recipe. Follow these steps to complete this recipe:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Open a Terminal window and launch PowerShell on it.</li><li>Enter the following code to get the object type:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; 'I am a string.' | Get-Member | Select-Object TypeName -Unique</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>What if you wanted to use a contraction for I am?</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; 'I'm a string.'</strong></span></pre><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>PowerShell waits for a prompt. Enter another single quote and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter </em></span>key.</li></ol></div><p>You should receive an error that there was an unexpected token.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Enter two quotes for the contraction instead of one, like so:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; 'I''m a string.'</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Now, try to show the value of your home directory within the string:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; 'I''m a string, and the home directory I''ve been asked to show is $HOME.'</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>This did not show you the path to your home directory. Is it possible to force a line break?</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>PS&gt; 'I''m a string.`nI love showing up on the screen.'</strong></span></pre></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec191"></a>How it works…</h3></div></div></div><p>We saw three things in this recipe. We simply put some text <span>between</span><a id="id325906084" class="indexterm"></a> two single quotes and the text echoed. There was no need for a cmdlet. Second, to show a quote within a literal string, you add two quotes. This instructs PowerShell that the quotation mark is part of the string. Third, variables and escape characters appear as they are when included within a literal string.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note49"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">`n</code> is a line break. In Bash (and possibly many other programming languages as well), we are used to using <code class="literal">\n</code> for a line break. PowerShell uses <code class="literal">`</code> as the escape character, just like .NET. PowerShell was created with system administrators in mind. While Unix-like operating systems use <code class="literal">/</code> as the separator in paths, Windows uses <code class="literal">\</code>. .NET and PowerShell use <code class="literal">`</code> (the backtick) to avoid confusion.</p></div></div></div>
