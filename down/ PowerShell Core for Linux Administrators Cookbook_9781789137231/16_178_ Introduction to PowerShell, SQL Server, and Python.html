PowerShell runs really well on Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat Linux, and even macOS. In the last decade, since its birth, PowerShell has propelled automation extensively due to several of its qualities such as flexibility, dynamism, remoting capabilities, and modularity, not to mention being baked into the operating system.</p><p>SQL Server is one of the greatest benefactors of PowerShell, having several database management and automation capabilities built in. Ever since PowerShell, we've found it a lot easier to load the related modules and invoke the respective cmdlets to take care of several day-to-day activities, from simple querying to complex maintenance.</p><p>The <code class="literal">SqlServer</code> module allows SQL Server administrators and developers to automate server administration.</p><p>PowerShell is the prime candidate when it comes to scripting and automation in the world of Windows systems that are based on one of the main benefits of PowerShell, which is the deep integration with Windows APIs, and its general extensibility. The flexibility of PowerShell addresses most of the challenges we've had for several years in managing Windows systems. Today, PowerShell is available for Linux as well. In my opinion, it helps both Windows and Linux administrators go cross-platform. Perhaps the day has come that we can use both systems as if they were one.</p><p>Python has been around for a long time and is known for its simplicity, among several other fortes, which makes it one of the go-to languages for deep learning and machine learning. Despite the current popularity of PowerShell, Python, for SQL Server, is still a matter of preference for some professionals, as it does offer some compelling features and advantages:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789137231/graphics/a8f1a125-e1da-4e8b-a5b3-32596bc28c98.png" /></div><p> </p></div>
