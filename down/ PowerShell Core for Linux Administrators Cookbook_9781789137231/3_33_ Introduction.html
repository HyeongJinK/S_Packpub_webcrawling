Given that we have familiarized ourselves (and perhaps been a little overwhelmed by the volume of the last chapter), we will take a lighter approach to our first steps to administration using PowerShell.</p><p>So far, we have seen how to run cmdlets, what their parameters are, how to set and use aliases, and so on. In this chapter, we will learn how to use some basic utilities, work with processes, and call applications.</p><p>Also, even though the title of this book says Linux, most of the recipes in this book should work on Windows as well; minor modifications may be required, such as using the backslash in paths.</p><p> </p></div>
