The point is, combining two <span>array</span><a id="id325585859" class="indexterm"></a>s is no different than adding elements to an array. Here is the scenario. You have two lists, each 10 names long. You have to combine them into a single list of 20 names.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec267"></a>How to do it…</h3></div></div></div><p>The process is simple. This is the flow we are going to follow:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Import the contents of the first file into a variable</li><li>Import the contents of the second file into another variable</li><li>Combine the arrays</li></ol></div><p>And this is the script that will help you with this:</p><pre class="programlisting">$ListOne = Get-Content ./ch09/05-list-one.txt
$ListTwo = Get-Content ./ch09/05-list-two.txt

"List one contains $($ListOne.Count) items."
"List two contains $($ListTwo.Count) items."

$CombinedList = $ListOne + $ListTwo

$CombinedList</pre><p> </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec268"></a>How it works…</h3></div></div></div><p>In this recipe, we did not initialize an array, because we already had two arrays as the input. When we created <code class="literal">$CombinedList</code>, PowerShell understood, from the assignment operation, that the resultant object type should be an array. When <code class="literal">ListOne</code> and <code class="literal">ListTwo</code> were added, PowerShell, instead of combining all the names into a single string, simply combined the two arrays and added each array as arrays themselves.</p><p>One important point to note here is that when an <span>array</span><a id="id326385422" class="indexterm"></a> is created, it is of a fixed length. In other words, suppose you said <code class="literal">$ListOne += $ListTwo</code>; the <code class="literal">$ListOne</code>array does not directly get altered, since the length of <code class="literal">$ListOne</code> is fixed at 10. PowerShell, in the background, measures the lengths of the two arrays in question, creates a temporary array of length 20, adds the elements of both the source arrays into this array, and then re-initializes <code class="literal">$ListOne</code> as an array of length 20 and assigns all the elements from the temporary array into <code class="literal">$ListOne</code>.</p></div></div>
