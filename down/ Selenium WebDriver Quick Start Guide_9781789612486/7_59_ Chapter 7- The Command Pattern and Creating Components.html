Frameworks help us with grouping components together and wiring them as per our needs. With a proper and structured framework, adding test cases is just a matter of updating the Excel sheet that has all of the test cases and test steps. It is just a matter of keeping track of the keys in the framework, which in our case is the test case ID.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the command design pattern</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The project structure in Eclipse</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introducing the TestNG framework and <code class="literal">TestNG.xml</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring nodes on the Selenium Grid for remote execution</li></ul></div><p>The framework that we will be designing will be based on the command pattern. Hence, it will be a good idea to understand the command pattern first.</p></div>
