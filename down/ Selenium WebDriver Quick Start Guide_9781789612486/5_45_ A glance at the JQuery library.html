JQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries available today. JQuery makes DOM traversal and manipulation simple. JQuery becomes more powerful when used with <span class="strong"><strong><span>AJAX</span></strong></span>. AJAX stands for <span class="strong"><strong>A<span>synchronous JavaScript and XML</span></strong></span> and is a web-development technique to send and receive data in the background without refreshing the web page. Many <span>modern</span><a id="id325437570" class="indexterm"></a> websites are being built using a combination of JQuery and AJAX.</p><p>JQuery can be used via the <span class="strong"><strong>content delivery network</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CDN</strong></span>) or <span>downloaded</span><a id="id325437997" class="indexterm"></a> as a JS file. For the example in this chapter, we will be using the CDN approach. We are using the 3.3.1 version of JQuery.Â </p><p>Cross-browser compatibility is a major advantage of JQuery over raw JavaScript. JQuery is extensible and has rich AJAX support.</p><p>We will be creating a sample JQuery application for pulling data from a text file on the web server. We will be making use of the JQuery AJAX <code class="literal">load()</code> function to achieve this.</p></div>
