We bifurcated pop-up windows and alerts into modal and non-modal dialog and saw examples of these. We explored the Set interface and the simple for loop for handling popups. We created popups and alerts with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and saw how to handle those using Selenium scripts. Moreover, we had a look at the various methods of the Alert object. We had a look at the <code class="literal">switchTo()</code> methods and also grasped of handling frames. In this process, we created a sample frame. Finally, we saw what <code class="literal">ChromeOptions</code> were available and also saw options for Internet Explorer and Firefox.</p><p>The next chapter is going to cover one of the most important topics: synchronization.</p></div>
