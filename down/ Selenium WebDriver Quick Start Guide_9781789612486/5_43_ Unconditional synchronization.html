Someone who is new to Java might wonder what a thread is. Let's first learn about the concept of a thread.</p><p>A thread is a single sequence of execution in a program. A particular program always runs on one thread, which is called the <span class="strong"><strong>main thread</strong></span>. Another <span>type</span><a id="id325437572" class="indexterm"></a> of thread is one that is started from the main thread explicitly, and is called the <span class="strong"><strong>child thread</strong></span>. In all the programs that <span>we</span><a id="id325441756" class="indexterm"></a> have seen so far, the execution was done on the main thread.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec45"></a>Thread.sleep(long) </h3></div></div></div><p>Let's look at the <span>first</span><a id="id325441769" class="indexterm"></a> type of <span>unconditional</span><a id="id325441776" class="indexterm"></a> synchronization, <code class="literal">Thread.sleep</code>.</p><p>The signature of the <code class="literal">sleep(long)</code> method is <code class="literal">public static native void sleep(long) throws InterruptedException</code>. There is an overloaded version of the sleep method, <code class="literal">public static void sleep(long,int)</code>. Usually, the one with a single argument is used.</p><p>The <code class="literal">sleep(long)</code> method is a method in the <code class="literal">Thread</code> class that makes a particular thread wait for the specified number of milliseconds. When we enter <code class="literal">Thread.sleep(5000);</code><span> , we ask t</span>he main thread to wait for <code class="literal">5</code> seconds. Since the main thread stops, execution is halted for <code class="literal">5</code> seconds, after which the next statement is executed. If you put <code class="literal">Thread.sleep()</code> in many places in <span>your</span><a id="id325447115" class="indexterm"></a> code, you <span>pause</span><a id="id325447124" class="indexterm"></a> the main thread, which can slow down execution to a considerable extent. Therefore, it is not recommended that you use <code class="literal">Thread.sleep(long)</code> in your code, and that you instead use conditional synchronization.</p></div></div>
