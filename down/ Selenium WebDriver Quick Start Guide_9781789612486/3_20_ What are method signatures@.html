Say, for example, we have a method that adds two numbers. This is the method signature of this kind of method:</p><p><code class="literal">addNum(int, int)</code></p><p>The actual method is shown in the following code block. This method has to be invoked from another method or from the <code class="literal">main()</code> method, as in the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">public int addNum(int num1, int num2) {
    int result = num1 + num2;
    return result;
}
<span class="strong"><strong>Method call</strong></span>: addNum(10,20)
<span class="strong"><strong>Output</strong></span>: 30</pre><p>In the sections that follow, we will be looking at the method signatures of various important methods. But first, let's understand a concept of Java called List, which we will see in the <code class="literal">findElements</code> method.</p></div>
