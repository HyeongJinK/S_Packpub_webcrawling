We also learnt the frequently used methods in Selenium and created some reusable methods. The basic difference between <code class="literal">quit()</code> and <code class="literal">close()</code> was covered as well. We then had a look at what a Keyword-driven Framework was and what Maps are. The framework that we are going to design in the upcoming chapters was looked at from a bird's eye view. From this, we learned what Log4J and ExtentReports are.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a small diversion and look at two of the important concepts in Framework design: "Popups" and "Alerts". We will come to understand the concept of <span>window handle</span>. We will look at sets and arrays of window handles. We will write code to enter data in a pop-up form. In this process, we will also create a pop-up form if needed. So, stay <span>tuned.</span></p></div>
