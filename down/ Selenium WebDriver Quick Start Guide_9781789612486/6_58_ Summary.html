We created some generic methods that were put into <code class="literal">TestBase</code> at the end of this chapter. <code class="literal">TestBase</code> serves as a parent for all classes in our framework. This is where inheritance comes into the picture. We saw what <code class="literal">JavascriptExecutor</code> is and also created a few generic methods using this API. We went over a few scenarios of the <code class="literal">actions</code> class and <code class="literal">JavaScriptExecutor</code>. We saw the very important concept of listeners in Selenium and went over <code class="literal">EventFiringWebDriver</code> to listen to the executing code and log it to the console. We also downloaded the Selenium Server standalone for the setup of Selenium Grid and went over its architecture.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at the command pattern and the various pieces of the framework.</p></div>
