We started off with <code class="literal">Thread.sleep</code> and learned how it is not feasible in most situations. We looked at explicit waits and the <code class="literal">ExpectedConditions</code> class. We also learned about fluent waits, and learned how to configure the polling time and use it to display text at intervals. We explored the <code class="literal">Function</code><span>and 'predicates' components of fluent wait</span>s.</p><p>Finally, we established a best practice of not using implicit and explicit waits together. Doing so can have an unpredictable impact on the execution time of your script, and can even break explicit waits.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will dive deep into the <code class="literal">Actions</code> class and <code class="literal">JavascriptExecutor</code> in detail.</p></div>
