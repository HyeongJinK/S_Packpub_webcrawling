To overcome these, I recommend the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Be up to date with the Selenium documentation.</li><li>If you find the command pattern difficult to comprehend, create a simple driver script with an <code class="literal">ActionKeyword</code> class. Two classes should be more than enough.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>Fillo is a great API but still has some limitations. If your company has a database that you can use, go ahead and implement the framework in a database. This will give you more power over joins and complex queries, which can help in retrieving information.</li><li>Read books on other frameworks, such as the Page Object Model.</li><li>Read Selenium blogs.</li></ol></div></div>
