We walked through the components of this behavioral pattern and developed the client, invoker, command, and receiver. We also took a look at how to create classes with empty implementations. Finally, we explored the setup of the Selenium Grid node and ran tests in parallel.</p><p>This was a very important chapter from a framework design standpoint. In the next chapter, we will touch upon the Data Provider and creating Excel reports. We will then look at TestNG listeners.</p></div>
