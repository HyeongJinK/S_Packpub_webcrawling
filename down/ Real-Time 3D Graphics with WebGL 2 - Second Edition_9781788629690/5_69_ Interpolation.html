Unlike parametric curves, it is not necessary to define the position of the object as a function of time. When <span>interpolation</span><a id="id325357458" class="indexterm"></a> is used, we only need to define control points or knots. The set of control points describes the path that a particular animate object will follow. There are many interpolation methods; however, it’s always a good idea to start with the basics.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec101"></a>Linear Interpolation</h3></div></div></div><p>This method <span>requires</span><a id="id325617385" class="indexterm"></a> that we define the <span>starting</span><a id="id325631830" class="indexterm"></a> and ending points of the location of our object, along with the number of interpolating steps. The object will move on the line determined by the starting and ending points:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/64fb9f2c-dce5-4124-8b35-2e96cda4d3b0.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec102"></a>Polynomial Interpolation</h3></div></div></div><p>This method allows us to <span>determine</span><a id="id325631885" class="indexterm"></a> as many control points as we want. The object will move from the starting point to the ending point and will pass through each one of the <span>control</span><a id="id325631894" class="indexterm"></a> points in between:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/f5864967-7067-4b95-b1e6-40bb6bab74cf.png" /></div><p>While using polynomials, an increasing number of control points can produce undesired oscillations on the object's path described by this technique. This is known as <span class="strong"><strong>Runge's phenomenon</strong></span>. The following <span>diagram</span><a id="id325638056" class="indexterm"></a> illustrates the result of moving one of the control points of a polynomial described with <code class="literal">11</code> control points:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/10b680a6-c936-4070-8953-b5deb8ee664b.png" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec103"></a>B-Splines</h3></div></div></div><p>This method is similar to <span>polynomial</span><a id="id325643372" class="indexterm"></a> interpolation with the difference that the control points are outside of the object's path. In other words, the object does not pass through the control points as it moves. In general, this method is common in computer graphics because the knots allow for much smoother path-generation than the polynomial equivalent at the same time that fewer knots are required. B-splines also <span>respond</span><a id="id325643381" class="indexterm"></a> better to Runge's phenomenon:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/6f7b3660-80a9-450f-9208-a99336b99eeb.png" /></div><p>In the following <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action</em></span> section, we will see in the three different interpolation techniques that have been introduced in practice: <span class="strong"><strong>linear</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>polynomial</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>b-spline</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
