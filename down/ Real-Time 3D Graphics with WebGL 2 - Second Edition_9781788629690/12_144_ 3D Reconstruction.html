Although these are common approaches for building 3D assets, they require manual labor to create them. Are there other techniques for getting geometries? Yes, of course! <span class="strong"><strong>3D reconstruction</strong></span> is the process of creating 3D models from images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes. Here's an example of a 3D model that has been generated purely from aerial photographs by a technique called Photogrammetry:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/d2b4f457-9163-4831-8906-decc161b2b09.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note104"></a>Note</h3><p><strong class="userinput"><code>Photogrammetry</code></strong>
Photogrammetry is the science of making spatial measuring from photographs. This is a powerful technique for recovering the exact positions of surface points.
