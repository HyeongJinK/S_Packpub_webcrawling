Over time, however, application requirements became more ambitious and began running into limitations. As highly interactive applications became an increasingly important part of the user experience, there was, eventually, enough demand for a fully <span>programmable</span><a id="id325614929" class="indexterm"></a> graphics <span class="strong"><strong>Application Programming Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>API</strong></span>) to address these requirements. In 2006, Vladimir Vukicevic, an American-Serbian software engineer, began working on an OpenGL prototype for a then-upcoming HTML <code class="literal">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element that he called Canvas 3D. In March 2011, his work would lead to the Kronos Group, the <span>nonprofit</span><a id="id325617269" class="indexterm"></a> organization behind OpenGL, to create <span class="strong"><strong>WebGL</strong></span>, a specification <span>to</span><a id="id325617280" class="indexterm"></a> grant internet browsers access to <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics Processing Units</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPUs</strong></span>).</p><p>All of the browser engines collaborated to create WebGL, the standard for rendering 3D graphics on the web. It was based on OpenGL <span class="strong"><strong>Embedded Systems</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ES</strong></span>), a cross-platform API for graphics targeted at embedded systems. This was the right starting place, because it <span>made</span><a id="id325617350" class="indexterm"></a> it possible to easily implement the same API in all browsers, especially since most browser engines were running on systems that had support for OpenGL. </p><p>WebGL was originally based on OpenGL ES 2.0, the OpenGL specification version for devices such as Apple's iPhone and iPad. But, as the specification evolved, it became independent with the goal of providing portability across various operating systems and devices. The idea of web-based, real-time rendering opened a new world of possibilities for web-based 3D environments. Due to the pervasiveness of web browsers, these and other kinds of 3D applications could now be rendered on desktop and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. According to the Khronos Group, the ability for Web developers to directly access OpenGL-class graphics directly from JavaScript, and freely mix 3D with other HTML content, will enable a new wave of innovation in Web gaming, educational and training applications.</p><p>Even though WebGL was vastly adopted for many years after it matured into a stable release—shipping inside Firefox, Chrome, Opera, IE11, and Android's mobile web browsers—Apple still lacked official WebGL support. Neither OS X Safari nor Safari Mobile supported WebGL. In fact, it wasn't until 2014, at June's <span class="strong"><strong>Worldwide Developers Conference</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WWDC</strong></span>), that Apple announced that both OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 would ship <span>with</span><a id="id325617369" class="indexterm"></a> WebGL support. This became a turning point for 3D graphics on the web. With official support from all major browsers, the entire range of 3D graphics—at native speeds—could be delivered to billions of desktop and mobile devices. WebGL unleashed the power of graphics processors to developers on an open platform, allowing console-quality application to be built for the web.</p><p>In this chapter, we will do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand the necessary system requirements to run WebGL.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cover the common high-level components of a WebGL application.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Set up a drawing area (<code class="literal">canvas</code>).</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Test your browser's WebGL capabilities.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand that WebGL acts as a state machine.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Modify WebGL variables that affect your scene.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Load and examine a fully-functional scene.</li></ul></div></div>
