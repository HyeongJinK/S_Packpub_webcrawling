We learned that WebGL 1 is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, while WebGL 2 is based on OpenGL ES 3.0, which guarantees many features that are offered in WebGL 1 as <span class="emphasis"><em>optional</em></span> extensions, along with many other powerful methods. Although we’ve used WebGL 2 to learn a wide range of computer graphics topics, almost all that knowledge and all of those skills translate to other graphics APIs. That being said, let’s take a moment to cover the key features that WebGL 2 provides over WebGL 1, along with a strategy for migration from WebGL 1 to WebGL 2.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A more extensive look at the WebGL 2 API</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">New additions to the WebGL 2 core specification</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A strategy for migrating 3D applications from WebGL 1 to WebGL 2</li></ul></div></div>
