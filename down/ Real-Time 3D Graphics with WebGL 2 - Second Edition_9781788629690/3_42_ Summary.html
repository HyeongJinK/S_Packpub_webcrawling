With the help of several examples, we also covered how to implement these shading and lighting models in code using ESSL, and how to communicate between the WebGL code and the ESSL code through attributes and uniforms.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We can use the vertex shader and the fragment shader to define a lighting model for our 3D scene.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We covered many of these operations through the lens of the latest and greatest techniques provided to us in WebGL 2's updated shading language.</li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will expand on using matrices in ESSL so that we can learn how to use them to represent and move our viewpoint in a 3D scene.</p></div>
