So far, we have only discussed static scenes, where all interactions are done by moving the camera. With these interactions, a camera transformation is applied to all objects in the 3D scene; we therefore call it a <span class="emphasis"><em>global</em></span> transform. However, objects in 3D scenes can have actions of their own. For instance, in a car-racing game, each car has its own speed and trajectory. In a first-person shooter game, enemies can hide behind barricades, come to fight, or simply run away. In general, each one of these actions is modeled as a matrix transformation that is attached to the corresponding actor in the scene. These are called <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> transforms.</p><p>In this chapter, you will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn the difference between global and local transformations.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about matrix stacks and how to use them to perform animations.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use JavaScript timers to do time-based animations.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about parametric curves.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about interpolation.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Explore various interpolation techniques.</li></ul></div></div>
