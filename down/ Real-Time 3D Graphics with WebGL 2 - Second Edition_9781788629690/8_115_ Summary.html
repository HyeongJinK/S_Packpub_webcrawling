A renderbuffer is a special buffer that is attached to a framebuffer.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We learned that WebGL provides mechanisms to create offscreen framebuffers that differ from the default onscreen framebuffer.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We covered how a framebuffer needs to have at least one texture to store colors and a renderbuffer to store depth information.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We discussed how to convert user click coordinates to <code class="literal">canvas</code> coordinates so that we can map them to values in the offscreen framebuffer.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We discussed the <code class="literal">Picker</code> architecture. Picking can have different states, and each state is associated with a callback function. Picker callbacks allow custom application logic to determine what happens when picking is in progress.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We learned how to implement color-based picking in WebGL. Picking purely based on a diffuse color is limited, because there could be scenarios where several objects have the same diffuse color.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We learned that it’s better to assign a new color property that is unique for every object to perform picking. This property is known as picking the color/object label.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We discussed encoding unique IDs rather than unique colors into the four-based vector, RGBA.</li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will bring all of the concepts we've covered in the previous chapters together and build a 3D virtual car showroom. Additionally, we will see how to import car models from Blender, a 3D editing tool, into a WebGL application.</p></div>
