This attribute is called the <span class="strong"><strong>alpha channel</strong></span>. The extended model then is known as the <span class="strong"><strong>RGBA</strong></span> model, where A stands for alpha. The <span>alpha</span><a id="id325358928" class="indexterm"></a> channel contains a value between the range of <code class="literal">0.0</code> to <code class="literal">1.0</code>, just like the other three channels (red, green, and blue). The following diagram shows the RGBA color space. On the horizontal axis, you can see the different colors that can be obtained by combining the <code class="literal">R</code>, <code class="literal">G</code>, and <code class="literal">B</code> channels. The vertical axis corresponds to the alpha channel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/321d42dd-83f8-4f61-b49f-030c801229e6.png" /></div><p>The alpha channel carries extra information about a color. This information affects the way the color is rendered on the screen. In most cases, the alpha value will refer to the amount of opacity that the color contains. A completely opaque color will have an alpha value of <code class="literal">1.0</code>, whereas a completely transparent color will have an alpha value of <code class="literal">0.0</code>. This is the general case, but as we will see, we need to take other factors into account when we obtain <span>translucent</span><a id="id325631870" class="indexterm"></a> colors.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note62"></a>Note</h3><p><strong class="userinput"><code>Transparent Versus Translucent</code></strong>
Glass, for example, is transparent to all visible light. Translucent objects allow some light to travel through them. Materials such as frosted glass and some plastics are called translucent. When light strikes translucent materials, only some of the light passes through them.</p></div><p>We use colors <span>everywhere</span><a id="id325631886" class="indexterm"></a> in our WebGL 3D scenes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Objects</strong></span>: 3D objects can be colored by selecting one color for every pixel (fragment) or by selecting the color that the object will have based on the material's diffuse property.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lights</strong></span>: Even <span>though</span><a id="id325638048" class="indexterm"></a> we have been using white lights, there is no reason we can't have lights whose ambient or diffuse properties contain other colors.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>: The background of our <span>scene</span><a id="id325638061" class="indexterm"></a> has a color that we can change by calling <code class="literal">gl.clearColor</code>. Also, as we will see later on, there are special operations that need to be performed on objects' colors to achieve translucent effects.</li></ul></div></div>
