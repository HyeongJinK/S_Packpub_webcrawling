More specifically, we learned about the differences between local and global transformations.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We learned about the <code class="literal">requestAnimationFrame</code> browser and built our own version with JavaScript timers for animation.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">An animation timer that is not tied up to the rendering cycle provides a lot of flexibility by ensuring that the time in the scene is independent of how fast it can be rendered on screen.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We distinguished between animation and simulation strategies for various problem-solving approaches.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We looked at interpolation methods and their various approaches.</li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will play with colors and blending in a WebGL scene. We will study the interaction between objects and light colors, and learn how to create translucent objects.</p></div>
