This camera is interactive where the viewpoint can change, depending on user input. For example, we used various keys and the mouse to move the camera around the car.</li></ul></div><p>There are many other elements in this scene such as textures, colors, and special light effects (specularity). Do not panic! We <span>will</span><a id="id325643389" class="indexterm"></a> explain each element throughout this book. The point here is to identify that the four basic elements we discussed previously are present in the scene. That said, feel free to examine the source code to get a sense of what's to come.</p></div>
