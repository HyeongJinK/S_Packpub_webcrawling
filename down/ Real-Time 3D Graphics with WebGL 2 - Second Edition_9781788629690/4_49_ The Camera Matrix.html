A camera should be able to rotate and translate to explore this 3D world. As we <span>saw</span><a id="id325358923" class="indexterm"></a> in the previous section, a 4x4 matrix can encode rotations and translations. Therefore, you should use one such matrix to represent our hypothetical camera.</p><p>Let's assume that our camera is located at the origin of the world and that it's oriented so that it's looking toward the negative z-axis direction. This is a good starting point; we already know what transformation represents such a configuration in WebGL (Identity matrix of rank four).</p><p>For the sake of analysis, let's break the problem down into two subproblems: camera-translation and camera-rotation. We will have a practical demo for each one.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec72"></a>Camera Translation</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's move the camera to <code class="literal">[0, 0, 4]</code> in world coordinates. This means four units from the origin on the positive z-axis. Remember, at this point, we do <span>not</span><a id="id325401430" class="indexterm"></a> know about a matrix that moves the camera. We only know how to move the <span class="emphasis"><em>world</em></span> (with the Model-View matrix). If we applied:</p><pre class="programlisting">mat4.translate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, [0, 0, 4]);</pre><p>In such a case, the world would be translated <code class="literal">4</code> units on the positive z-axis, and since the camera position has not been changed, it would be located at <code class="literal">[0, 0, -4]</code>, which is exactly the opposite of what we want.</p><p>Now, say that we applied the translation in the opposite direction:</p><pre class="programlisting">mat4.translate(modelViewMatrix, modelViewMatrix, [0, 0, -4]);</pre><p>In such a case, the world would be moved <code class="literal">4</code> units on the negative z-axis and then the camera would be located at <code class="literal">[0, 0, 4]</code> in the new world-coordinate system.</p><p>In the following section, we will explore translations in both world space and camera space.</p></div></div>
