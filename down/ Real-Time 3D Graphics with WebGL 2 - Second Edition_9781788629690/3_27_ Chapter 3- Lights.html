Although we briefly covered shaders and their role in creating a WebGL application, we will go into more detail in this chapter and leverage the vertex and fragment shaders to create a lighting model for our scene.</p><p>Shaders allow us to define a mathematical model that governs how our scene is lit. To learn how to implement shaders, we will study different algorithms and see examples of their application. A basic knowledge of linear algebra will be really useful to help you understand the contents of this chapter. We will use a JavaScript library that handles most of the vector and matrix operations, so you do not need to worry about the mathematical operations. Nonetheless, your overall success depends on a strong conceptual understanding of the linear algebra operations that we will discuss.</p><p>In this chapter, we will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about light sources, normals, and materials.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn the difference between shading and lighting.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use the Goraud and Phong shading methods.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use the Lambertian and Phong lighting models.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Define and use uniforms, attributes, and varyings.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Work with ESSL, the shading language for WebGL.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Discuss relevant WebGL API methods that relate to shaders.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Continue our analysis of WebGL as a state machine and describe the attributes relevant to shaders that can be set and retrieved from the state machine.</li></ul></div></div>
