So far, for the purpose of our examples, we’ve assumed that our light source is infinitely far <span>away</span><a id="id325357458" class="indexterm"></a> from the scene. This assumption allows us to model the light rays as being parallel to each other. An example of this is sunlight. These lights are <span class="emphasis"><em>directional lights</em></span>. Now, we are going to consider a case where the light source is relatively close to the object it needs to illuminate. Think, for example, of a desk lamp illuminating the document you’re reading. These lights are <span class="emphasis"><em>positional lights</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/c3e7f8ef-b52f-476b-9dfd-90ca6315e362.png" /></div><p>As we experienced before, when working with directional lights, only one variable is required. This is the light direction we represented in the <code class="literal">uLightDirection</code> uniform.</p><p>In contrast, when working with positional lights, we need to know the location of the light. We can represent it by using a uniform that we will name <code class="literal">uLightPosition</code>. As is the case when using positional lights, the light rays here are not parallel to each other; as a result, we need to calculate each light ray separately. We will do this by using a varying that we will name <code class="literal">vLightRay</code>.</p><p>In the next section, we will investigate how a positional light interacts with a scene.</p></div>
