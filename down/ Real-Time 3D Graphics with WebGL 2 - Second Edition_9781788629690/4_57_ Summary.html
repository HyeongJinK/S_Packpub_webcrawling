However, we can build one using the Model-View matrix.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">3D objects undergo several transformations to be displayed on a 2D screen. These transformations are represented as 4x4 matrices.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scene transformations are affine. Affine transformations are constituted by a linear transformation followed by a translation. The WebGL groups affine transforms into three matrices: the Model-View matrix, the Projection matrix, and the Normal matrix, and one WebGL operation: <code class="literal">gl.viewport()</code>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Affine transforms are applied in projective space, so they can be represented by 4x4 matrices. To work in projective space, vertices need to be augmented to contain an extra term, namely <code class="literal">w</code>, which is called the perspective coordinate. The four-tuple <code class="literal">(x, y, z, w)</code> is called Homogeneous coordinates. Homogeneous coordinates allow representation of lines that intersect on infinity by making the perspective coordinate <code class="literal">w = 0</code>. Vectors always have a Homogeneous coordinate, <code class="literal">w = 0</code>, while points have a Homogeneous coordinate, namely, <code class="literal">w = 1</code> (unless they are at infinity, in which case <code class="literal">w = 0</code>).
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">By default, a WebGL scene is viewed from the world origin in the negative direction of the z-axis. This can be altered by changing the Model-View matrix.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Camera matrix is the inverse of the Model-View matrix. The camera and world operations are opposites. There are two basic types of cameras: <span class="emphasis"><em>orbiting</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>tracking</em></span>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Normals receive special treatment whenever the object undergoes an affine transform. Normals are transformed by the Normal matrix, which can be obtained from the Model-View matrix.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The Projection matrix allows us to determine two basic projective modes: <span class="emphasis"><em>orthographic</em></span> projection and <span class="emphasis"><em>perspective</em></span> projection.</li></ul></div><p>In the next chapter, we will take what we've learned here about transformations to distinguish between global and local transformations. We will look at transformations that are <span class="emphasis"><em>global</em></span>, as we've covered here, and transformations that are <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> to individual objects in our 3D scene.</p></div>
