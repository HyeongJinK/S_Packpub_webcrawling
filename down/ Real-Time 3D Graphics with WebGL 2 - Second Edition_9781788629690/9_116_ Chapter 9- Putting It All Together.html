In this chapter, we will bring together all of the concepts we've learned so far to build a 3D virtual car showroom. In the development of this demo application, we will use models, lights, cameras, animation, colors, textures, and more. We will also learn how to integrate these elements with a simple yet effective graphical user interface.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Put together all of the architecture we've developed throughout this book</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Create a 3D virtual car showroom application using our architecture</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Import car models from Blender into a WebGL scene</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Set up several light sources</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Create robust shaders to handle multiple materials</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about the OBJ and MTL file formats</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Program the camera to fly through the scene</li></ul></div></div>
