These fundamental elements will be covered, chapter-by-chapter, throughout this book.</p><p>Some of these <span>common</span><a id="id325628673" class="indexterm"></a> elements include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">canvas</code>: It is the <span>placeholder</span><a id="id325628689" class="indexterm"></a> where our scene is rendered. It is a standard HTML5 element and as such, can be accessed using the <span class="strong"><strong>Document Object Model</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DOM</strong></span>).</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Objects</strong></span>: These <span>are</span><a id="id325628711" class="indexterm"></a> the 3D entities <span>that</span><a id="id325628720" class="indexterm"></a> make up the scene. These entities are composed of triangles. In the following chapters, we will see how WebGL handles and renders <span>geometries</span><a id="id325631833" class="indexterm"></a> using <span class="strong"><strong>buffers</strong></span>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lights</strong></span>: Nothing in a 3D world <span>can</span><a id="id325631881" class="indexterm"></a> be seen without lights. In later chapters, we will learn that WebGL uses <span class="strong"><strong>shaders </strong></span>to <span>model</span><a id="id325631894" class="indexterm"></a> lights in the scene. We will see how 3D objects reflect or absorb light according to the laws of physics. We will also discuss different light models to visualize our objects.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Camera</strong></span>: <code class="literal">canvas</code> acts as <span>the</span><a id="id325638050" class="indexterm"></a> viewport to the 3D world. We see and explore a 3D scene through it. In the following chapters, we will understand the different matrix operations that are required to produce a view perspective. We will understand how these operations can be modeled as a camera.</li></ul></div><p>This chapter will cover the first element of our list: <code class="literal">canvas</code>. The following sections will help us understand how to create a <code class="literal">canvas</code> element and how to set up a WebGL context.</p></div>
