If that were the case and you selected one of them, how could you determine which one is picked based on its color? In the following <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for Action</em></span> section, we will implement unique object labels. The objects will be rendered in the offscreen framebuffer using these color labels instead of the diffuse colors. The scene will still be rendered on the screen using the non-unique diffuse colors.</p></div>
