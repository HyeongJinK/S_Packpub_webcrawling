We did so by leveraging various shading and light reflection <span>techniques</span><a id="id325358855" class="indexterm"></a> that use two main components: specular and diffuse. Although we've been modeling materials with specular and diffuse in computer graphics for a long time, these techniques produce results that are not very realistic. For example, changing the specularity of a material doesn't change the diffuse:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/145d507d-906d-49bc-931a-1241a5347098.png" /></div><p>The preceding screenshot demonstrates that changing the two parameters of specular intensity and specular hardness only changes the whitish part of the reflection. The blue diffuse reflection doesn't change at all—that's not how our physical world works! So, in applications aiming for more realistic effects, an artist would be tasked with manually tuning these values for each material until it "looked right", which is an inefficient method at best. There has to be a better way!</p><p>Enter <span class="strong"><strong>Physically-Based Rendering</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PBR</strong></span>), an <span>approach</span><a id="id325617283" class="indexterm"></a> to validate our material descriptions in the more objective, measurable, and scientific properties of real surfaces. One of the most apparent properties is the conservation of energy: a rougher surface will scatter light diffusely, while a smoother/more metallic surface will reflect light more directly, even though it's the same pool of light they are both drawn from. So, with all things being equal, the rule follows that as materials become shinier, the diffuse component should darken:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788629690/graphics/b9300beb-84c8-45b2-8a70-abed39f8c9d2.png" /></div><p>Of course, there's more to physically-based rendering than energy conservation; however, this is a clear example that demonstrates the properties of a physically-based system. By keeping the reflection models similar to the way materials work in real life, we reduce the need for subjective manual tuning and produce real-world materials that look realistic under a variety of light conditions.</p></div>
