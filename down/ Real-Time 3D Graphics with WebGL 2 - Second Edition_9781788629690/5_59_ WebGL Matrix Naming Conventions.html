As we've seen, WebGL is a simple API with nearly everything – except for a few predefined names, such as <code class="literal">gl_Position</code>– defined by you, the programmer. That being said, common and semi-common naming conventions do exist. This is especially true for matrices. Here are a few important ones we’ve already covered, along with a few new ones that we’ll cover shortly:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>World Matrix:</strong></span> Sometimes <span>referred</span><a id="id325358945" class="indexterm"></a> to as the <span class="strong"><strong>Model matrix</strong></span>, this is a <span>matrix</span><a id="id325358955" class="indexterm"></a> that takes the vertices of a model and moves them to world space.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Camera Matrix:</strong></span> This <span>matrix</span><a id="id325401397" class="indexterm"></a> positions the camera in the world. You can also think of it as the World matrix for the camera.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>View Matrix:</strong></span> This matrix moves <span>everything</span><a id="id325617291" class="indexterm"></a> else in the world in front of the camera. As we've seen, this is the inverse of the Camera matrix.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Projection Matrix:</strong></span> This is the <span>matrix</span><a id="id325617303" class="indexterm"></a> that converts a frustum of space into clip space. You can also think of it as the matrix returned by your matrix math library's perspective or orthographic function.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Local Matrix</strong></span>: The <span>matrix</span><a id="id325617358" class="indexterm"></a> is used in scene graphs, where the matrix, at any particular node on the graph, is used before multiplying with any other nodes.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note56"></a>Note</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scene Graph</strong></span>This is a data structure, commonly used by vector-based graphics-editing applications and modern computer games, that arranges the logical and often spatial representation of a graphical scene. A scene graph is a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure.
