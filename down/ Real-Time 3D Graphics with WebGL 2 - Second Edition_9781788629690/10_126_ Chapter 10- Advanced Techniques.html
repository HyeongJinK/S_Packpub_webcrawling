This means that at this point, you have all of the information you need to create rich 3D applications with WebGL. However, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible with WebGL! Creative use of shaders, textures, and vertex attributes can yield fantastic results. In these final chapters, we'll cover a few advanced WebGL concepts that should leave you eager to explore more.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learn various post-processing effects</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing a particle system using point sprites</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand how to use normal mapping</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implement how to use ray tracing</li></ul></div></div>
