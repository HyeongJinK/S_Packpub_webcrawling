Before proceeding to discuss text summarization and how we do it, we should define what a summary is. The summary is a text output that is generated from one or more texts that conveys relevant information from the original text in a shorter form. The goal of automatic text summarization is to transform the source text into a shorter version using semantics. Lately, various approaches have been developed for automated text summarization using NLP techniques, and they have been implemented widely in various domains. Some examples include search engines creating summaries for use in previews of documents and news websites producing consolidated descriptions of news topics, usually as headlines, to help users browse.</p><p>T<span>o summarize tex</span>t effectively, deep learning models need to be able to understand documents and discern and distill the important information. These methods are highly challenging and complex, particularly as the length of a document increases.</p></div>
