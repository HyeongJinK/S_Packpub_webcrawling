Human, or natural, language is a method that developed to convey meaning and is not produced by a physical action of any kind. It is quite <span>different</span><a id="id324812542" class="indexterm"></a> from <span>vision</span><a id="id324812553" class="indexterm"></a> or any other machine learning task.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Natural language processing</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NLP</strong></span>) is one of the types of <span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>) that allow machines to analyze and understand the human language. NLP was begun to develop software that generates and understands natural languages so that a user can have natural conversations with his/her computer. NLP combines AI with computational linguistics and computer science to process human languages and speech.</p><p>Examples of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, document classification, word clustering, machine translation, and many more. This list is long, and the scenarios in which one can use NLP are even greater in number. This chapter aims to introduce you to recipes with an understanding of NLP techniques as applied to deep learning models so that you can adapt them to your dataset with ease and develop useful applications.</p></div>
