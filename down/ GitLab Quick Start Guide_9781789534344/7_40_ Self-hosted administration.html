These include options to help secure your instance as well as ways of checking up on instance health and resolving any issues. To take a peek at your administration settings, make sure you're logged in with an <strong class="userinput"><code>Admin</code></strong> account, and then click the wrench icon at the top of the page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/bbf8bb51-5e7f-408d-a61a-f2f42fe5385e.png" /></div><p>Here, you'll be faced with the dashboard, which gives you a good overview of your instance, including some basic statistics, a list of popular/powerful features and whether they're enabled, as well as a summary about the different components of GitLab.</p><p>In the left menu, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Messages</code></strong>, and you'll be taken to a panel where you can create messages that are broadcast to all logged in users for a period of time. These are useful to notify users of scheduled maintenance periods, potential outages, or new features/integrations/services:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/e340cad6-7d8c-41ff-8afb-cf984bc125bd.png" /></div><p> </p><p>On the left again, select <strong class="userinput"><code>Applications</code></strong> to get an overview of which OAuth applications are currently authorized on your instance. This is handy for checking which applications users are connecting to their GitLab accounts and allows you some measure of auditing. You can <strong class="userinput"><code>Destroy</code></strong> authorizations that are potentially harmful or no longer used; via the <strong class="userinput"><code>Edit</code></strong> option you can change their settings, including making them automatically authorized for any new users who use the application. Of course, if you don't want users to authorize any applications, you can disable this in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Administration</code></strong> settings, which we will investigate now.</p><p>By clicking <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> in the left menu from the <strong class="userinput"><code>Admin Area</code></strong>, you can view all the different UI settings that make up a GitLab instance and you can modify them to personalize, lock down, or enhance your instance. Next to each section, click expand to get a better look at the different options it offers.</p><p>Under <strong class="userinput"><code>Visibility and access controls</code></strong> are some simple settings about default privacy levels for projects, snippets, and groups, but above that you have <strong class="userinput"><code>Default branch protection</code></strong>. This is super handy for setting instance-wide behavior for each project's default branch. Typically, this refers to the master branch but can be customized through a project's settings page. By changing the protection level, you can limit who has the ability to push to the primary branch (especially handy if it is an automatically deployed branch) as well as prevent people from deleting the branch or limiting who can make merge requests to it. Further down, you can also set some security options regarding git operations, such as disallowing HTTP/HTTPS and limiting the types of SSH keys that can be used on the instance to prevent weaker encryption standards being used. This is <span>especially</span><a id="id325623432" class="indexterm"></a> handy if your organization has mandated or government-regulated standards around encrypted communications.</p><p>Under <strong class="userinput"><code>Account and limit</code></strong>, some of the useful settings include <strong class="userinput"><code>Default project limit</code></strong>, which is handy if you run a public instance and don't want people abusing your service by creating and hosting too many projects. You can also limit attachment sizes for a similar reason and prevent users from registering any OAuth applications that they want.</p><p>Next up, we have sign-up restrictions. This is probably one of the first setting areas you'll want to manage after you create a new instance. You can disable sign-up entirely if you have an internet-facing instance and don't want new users coming onboard before you're ready (or if you want to invite users manually). You can also require confirmation emails to ensure any sign-ups own the email address they're signing up from. This feature requires you to have an email provider and manually change the configuration on the server, which is outside the scope of this book, but GitLab's online documentation can walk you through it. If your instance is for use by a particular organization, you can also whitelist the email addresses that are allowed to prevent other people joining, or you can blacklist signups from domains that you've had problems with before.</p><p>If you have the time, it can be worth exploring the other sections too, as there are many settings available to customize your instance. Keep in mind that many of these advanced settings can heavily change the way GitLab runs, so be wary of changing anything unless you're sure of what it does.</p><p>Next up, let's explore some of the paid features related to issue tracking and project management.</p></div>
