We also looked at GitFlow, a recommended workflow for Git software projects, and how to handle branching and merging correctly.</p><p>In contrast to the complexities of GitFlow, we also looked at GitLab flow, which is an alternate recommended flow that's been designed for simplicity and is adaptable to different environments.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll look at using GitLab in our work, using issues to sort out items of work and performing merge requests to bring in changes that we've made.</p></div>
