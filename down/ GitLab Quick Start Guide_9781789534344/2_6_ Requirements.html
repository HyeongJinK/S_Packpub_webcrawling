This is feasible with one core, but you'll have the workers and background jobs running on the same core, which might slow things down. Above that, four cores will support about 2,000 users, and if you need any more than 40,000 users (which will run fine on 64 cores), you should probably look at running multiple application servers at once.</p><p>For memory, the recommendation is 2 GB of RAM, which will easily support 100 users with no issue. 1 GB of physical memory with 1 GB of swap space is probably the bare minimum you can get away with; it'll work okay with a small number of users, but can get quite slow. This would be appropriate for a tiny private instance for you and some friends or a fledgling start up. Any less RAM and you'll start getting some strange 5 xx errors being thrown during use and other errors if you try and reconfigure. You can also scale up to 2,000 users with 16 GB of RAM and upwards to 32,000 users on a beastly 256 GB server. Again, any more users required than that and you should probably be running multiple application servers.</p><p>Storage-wise, you'll definitely need enough space to handle all of your repositories combined (about 10-100 MB for many projects). On top of that, you'll have your database, which needs about 1 MB of space per user and will grow with time and more project involvement. Mostly, though, you'll need space for your operating system and all of the applications required by GitLab, so having at least 5-10 GB free is a good starting point.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec8"></a>Operating system</h3></div></div></div><p>GitLab provides an <span class="strong"><strong>omnibus</strong></span> package for <span>installation</span><a id="id325171406" class="indexterm"></a> on a <span>number</span><a id="id325171415" class="indexterm"></a> of platforms. This package has everything required to run a full-fledged GitLab instance, including the database (PostgreSQL), in-memory caching platform (Redis), background task queue (Sidekiq), and monitoring platform (Prometheus). This is the recommended way of installing GitLab for most circumstances, unless you are setting up for a massive instance, want more fine-grained control over the components, are looking to run your own public code hosting platform, use an unsupported Unix-based OS, or are reusing other equipment and servers. The omnibus package is currently available for the following operating systems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Ubuntu</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Debian</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">CentOS</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">OpenSUSE</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scientific Linux</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Oracle Linux</li></ul></div><p>If your operating system flavor of choice hasn't been mentioned, there is still the option of a manual installation, which has been tested on distributions including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Arch Linux</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Fedora</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">FreeBSD</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Gentoo</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">mac OS</li></ul></div><p>Please note that GitLab is not supported on non-Unix operating systems such as Windows, OS/2 Warp, or Plan Nine.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec9"></a>Languages and applications</h3></div></div></div><p>The core application of GitLab is based on Ruby and requires at least Ruby 2.3. Unfortunately, for fans of Ruby variants such as JRuby or Rubinius, GitLab relies on several gems (additional libraries) that have native extensions and thus relies on Ruby MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter).</p><p>This is the only extra requirement if you plan on using the <span>omnibus</span><span>installation</span><a id="id325174348" class="indexterm"></a> package. However, if you're looking to install manually, there are a few other requirements to get your head around.</p><p>First, you'll need a relational database; GitLab very highly recommends and is designed around PostgreSQL. However, in a bind, MySQL can be supported but with a few less features and a reduced experience (no geo replication or load balancing, no zero downtime migrations, and unoptimized dashboard loading). For PostgreSQL users, you should be on at least version 9.6 as this is what they use for development and testing; they can't guarantee compatibility with older versions.</p><p>The GitLab team only supports the last three releases of major browsers, and includes the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Google Chrome</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Mozilla Firefox</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">macOS Safari</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Microsoft Edge</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Microsoft Internet Explorer 11</li></ul></div><p>It's also important to be wary of the fact that GitLab must have JavaScript enabled in order to work in the web browser. Disabling it cannot guarantee that any part of the site will work since support for JS is baked into the core of the platform.</p></div></div>
