<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec39"></a>Wiki</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Another powerful and useful feature of GitLab that mirrors some other popular version-control platforms is the option to have project documentation available as a wiki. To access this section, go to a project and click <span>Wiki</span><a id="id325169341" class="indexterm"></a> in the menu on the left side. If you haven't created any wiki pages yet, you should be met with the following information notice and a button to <strong class="userinput"><code>Create your first page</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/c551428e-f419-4e38-a4ca-4eb8bd1e44df.png" /></div><p>Click the button to get started and create your wiki homepage. You'll notice that you have a few fields available to fill in. If you have a <strong class="userinput"><code>Title</code></strong> field available, make sure you leave it set to <strong class="userinput"><code>home</code></strong> for your first wiki page, as that's necessary for it to be jumped into when you navigate to the wiki in the project. You have the choice of formats to write your docs in, with markdown, RDoc, and AsciiDoc currently being offered.</p><p> </p><p>Once you've finished creating your wiki page, add a commit message in the final box (or use the default), and then click <strong class="userinput"><code>Create page</code></strong>. Why a commit message? That's because GitLab stores wikis as their own git repository, alongside your project's git repository! On the right side of the screen while looking at the wiki, you'll have a list of all the pages in alphabetical order, as well as an option to <strong class="userinput"><code>Clone repository</code></strong>. If you click this button, you'll be taken to a page with instructions on checking out a copy of the wiki locally so that you can edit it and commit your changes. You'll need the <code class="literal">gollum</code> Ruby gem in order to properly edit and build the wiki if you're thinking of playing around with it locally:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/1e7f6399-ae43-44e4-b42e-b314c905711c.png" /></div><p>From a <span>wiki</span><a id="id325235174" class="indexterm"></a> page, you can also check out the page history to see who made which edits and when, as well as any changes to format. This section is why commit messages are really useful, as you can write in what you changed to help others understand the growth of the document.</p><p>One last thing to remember is that guests will only have permissions to view wiki pages, so you'll need at least developer permissions on the project to make changes or create new pages.</p></div>
