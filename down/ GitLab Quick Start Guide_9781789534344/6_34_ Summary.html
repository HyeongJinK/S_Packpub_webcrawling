This is important because in many situations you may already have an established VCS or a code-hosting platform before you look at moving to GitLab, and it greatly reduces friction in moving to a new platform if you can easily import existing work.</p><p>We started the chapter by looking at importing from the biggest code-hosting platform around, GitHub. We looked at two methods of migrating: using the OAuth2 flow and using personal access tokens. Next up, we examined BitBucket by Atlassian and how to import Git projects from BitBucket into GitLab using the OAuth2 workflow. We then looked at importing any Git repository that can be accessed via URL, as well as the most low-tech method of simply downloading an existing repository to your local machine, changing the origin, and uploading to a new blank project on GitLab.</p><p>Aside from just importing projects from other code-hosting platforms, we also looked at how to convert from two other popular VCSes. We looked at moving from both SVN and Mercurial while not losing any of the branching or tagging information.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll look at some of the advanced features of GitLab as well as a number of features only available in paid versions.</p></div>
