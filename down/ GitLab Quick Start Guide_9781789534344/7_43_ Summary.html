We also discovered that you can have them attached to your account, or on a per-project basis if they're related to a particular project that you're working on.</p><p>Wikis are another project-level feature in GitLab that let you write documentation for your project and have it hosted alongside it so that anyone looking to try out your application, library, or code can read more about it.</p><p>For self-hosted instances of GitLab, we explored how to administrate your system by looking at charts, logs, and settings available to administrators. We also looked out how to enable the Mattermost integration, which lets self-hosted GitLab users access their own private instant messaging client, designed for both private and group discussions.</p><p>Lastly, we looked at a couple of key features of paid accounts, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>related issues, </em></span>which keep track of similarly themed problems that might come up, <span class="emphasis"><em>issue weights,</em></span> which let you assign priorities or complexity values to various issues, <span class="emphasis"><em>burndown charts,</em></span> which show you progress during milestones/sprints, and also <span class="emphasis"><em>merge request approvals</em></span> which limit code being included unless it has been marked as reviewed by a set number of people or by specific users/groups.</p><p>You should be familiar with all the main features of GitLab and be ready to tackle managing and contributing to projects with it, as well setting up and running your own GitLab instance if that better meets your organization's needs. Good luck in all your future endeavors; I can't wait to see what you build!</p></div>
