Tools such as related issues, burndown charts, and issue weighting can all be used to improve your workflow and power up your team.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec52"></a>Related issues</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're managing a project with many users, especially a public-facing project, you're probably used to users creating <span>issues</span><a id="id325499920" class="indexterm"></a> before checking for any similar issues that are already open or issues that may appear unrelated but have a similar cause. Thankfully, GitLab's Starter/Bronze level of enterprise subscription contains related issues:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/df649d1e-16ff-400e-a1b4-755725ee221b.png" /></div><p>With a Starter/Bronze enterprise subscription (or higher), you'll now see the <strong class="userinput"><code>Related issues</code></strong> box under the issue text. Click the plus symbol at the end and you'll be faced with a box where you can enter in related issues:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/9d640a68-9143-4f24-9f71-73530c03ae51.png" /></div><p>You can either paste a link to the issue or enter the issue ID preceded by a hash/pound/number/hashtag symbol. If you press a space after entering in an issue, it'll temporarily save that one and allow you to keep entering in other related issues. Once you're done, click <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong>, and all the related <span>issues</span><a id="id325500521" class="indexterm"></a> will be displayed in that box. This tool is bidirectional, meaning if you save a related issue, on that issue you'll also find a link back to this issue. There'll also be a small, colored symbol (with mouseover text) to let you know whether the related issues are open or closed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec53"></a>Issue weights</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're following the Scrum framework for managing a project or even just looking for a <span>way</span><a id="id325500352" class="indexterm"></a> to understand the amount of work required for tasks, the issue-weighting (sometimes known in other systems as story points) feature available to Starter/Bronze enterprise subscribers is probably right up your alley.</p><p>When you go to create a new issue, under Labels you should now have an option to include an issue weight—this can be any number from <strong class="userinput"><code>0</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>20</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/a6cda377-f482-435a-871f-a3f0ab27895a.png" /></div><p>￼If you don't agree with an existing issue weight or would prefer it to be added during a sprint setup meeting, you can modify the issue weight in the menu on the right:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/0b313da6-37fc-4005-8d74-f677e592e5f1.png" /></div><p>Now, when you look at the issue board, you should be able to see all the issue weights listed next to the scales icon. You can also choose to search based on an issue weighting (or search for all that don't have a weight attached) as well as sort them based on their issue weights:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/335cbd6c-152e-40d6-9315-b418607ba19d.png" /></div><p>You'll see these weightings when you look at an issue board, and also see the total of them when looking at a milestone, which can be helpful if you're using them to encapsulate a sprint of work and want to know how much should be possible to complete within a sprint.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec54"></a>Burndown charts</h3></div></div></div><p>Another project management tool that's popular with the <span>Scrum</span><a id="id325172256" class="indexterm"></a> framework, burndown <span>charts</span><a id="id325172264" class="indexterm"></a> are a great way of tracking how much work has been completed over a period of time.</p><p> </p><p>They're available in a project when looking at a Milestone—here is an example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/8f76860e-9b64-45fe-b859-a28a03437008.png" /></div><p>As you can see, it shows the amount of open issues in relation to the progression of time through a milestone. It shows a guideline of what progress should look like through the sprint; however, that should be taken with a grain of salt as many things can affect progress, such as weekends or breaks in a project, as well as changes in scope that force new tasks to be created. In the preceding example, you can see some early successes were overshadowed by new issues and little work was completed until early July, at which point the majority of the work was slammed <span>through</span><a id="id325174170" class="indexterm"></a> and only roughly five tasks remained open by the end of the milestone.</p><p>If you're inclined to use issue weights to track tasks, especially in environments where the complexity of tasks/features can be a huge range, then you can also view the burndown chart by issue weights, which might help reflect the work being done more accurately.</p></div></div>
