<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch05lvl1sec33"></a>GitLab CI/CD web UI</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>While we've explored how to get GitLab CI up and <span>running</span><a id="id325169436" class="indexterm"></a> by creating a <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file and looked at many of the configuration options available, we've only taken a brief look at the GitLab web user interface for continuous integration and continuous deployment. Let's break down the GitLab web user interface and look at how we can manage and inspect pipelines, jobs, charts, environments, and other common tasks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The pipelines screen can be accessed under your project by going to <strong class="userinput"><code>CI/CD</code></strong> and then <strong class="userinput"><code>Pipelines</code></strong> through the left-hand side menu. You should then be faced with a screen that looks something like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/1a6548d9-2d5a-45e8-9886-648ad740e230.png" /></div><p>Here, you can view a list of the pipelines that have run or are currently running, as well as their status (failed, passed, skipped, and so on), who organized them, what branches and commits they are for (including the commit message), the success/failure of each stage (represented by the tick boxes), and the runtime and when it completed. You'll notice across the top left that there are also some buttons that provide extra functionality. You can click <strong class="userinput"><code>Run Pipeline</code></strong> to organize a manual, immediate run of the pipeline against a preferred branch. There's also the aforementioned <strong class="userinput"><code>Clear Runner Caches</code></strong> button, which will immediately clear the cache on all connected Runners. The last button, <strong class="userinput"><code>CI Lint</code></strong>, takes you to a small web application that can be used to lint a <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code><span>file to ensure that the syntax is correct.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The output of a linted <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file looks like this:</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/319fbe87-05bf-425c-8cf3-de601a3fd90d.png" /></div><p>If the syntax passes its validation, you'll be shown the preceding message, as well as a table (visible in the following screenshot) that breaks down the keys and values provided in the script. You can use these to sanity check your work:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/a5d81a52-98eb-47dd-aaee-4630d0b2f87e.png" /></div><p>From the left menu under <strong class="userinput"><code>CI/CD</code></strong>, you can click <strong class="userinput"><code>Jobs</code></strong> to get a <span>listing</span><a id="id325168898" class="indexterm"></a> of all of the running, failed, and succeeded jobs. This view (shown in the following screenshot) provides information about each job, including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Status</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Branch</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Commit</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Pipeline
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Stage</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Name</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Run time</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Finish time</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/2fce3ca2-6384-4ad1-b1e2-4bd2f4368de4.png" /></div><p><span>Looking at the preceding screenshot, you'll will be able to see a play button that can be clicked to initiate a job that requires manual involvement.</span> Completed jobs also have a <strong class="userinput"><code>Re-Run</code></strong> button, which can be used to run the job again. Please note that these buttons are only available to people with the proper permissions in the GitLab instance. If there are artifacts to be downloaded, you'll also see a download button, which can be clicked on to begin downloading the zipped file containing all of the artifacts that were built in that job. If you only want to view the jobs relating to a specific pipeline, from the pipelines screen you can click the status of a pipeline and then click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Jobs</code></strong> tab to find similar information. However, this is limited to jobs that have been attached to that pipeline run.</p><p>From the menu on the left, under <strong class="userinput"><code>CI/CD</code></strong>, you can click <strong class="userinput"><code>Charts</code></strong> to get some graphical information about the CI/CD process attached to this project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/9da2990f-41d2-470f-9207-146684f1d999.png" /></div><p>The first section contains some data breakdowns next to a chart of the times required for the pipelines to run. This can be useful for diagnosing issues with your pipelines and analyzing when pipelines need to be optimized to reduce time-to-completion and speed up the development/test/release life cycle. Next up, we have charts showing the breakdown of pipelines over the past week, month, and year:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/9980c3e0-bf4b-4b9e-b74c-b00f59860fc7.png" /></div><p>You can see that it outlines both the total pipelines and the subset of successful pipelines in the charts. This can give good metrics on the active times for a project, as well as show trends relating to work that has been completed.</p><p>The last section of interest to us is <strong class="userinput"><code>Environments</code></strong>. By <span>clicking</span><a id="id325277280" class="indexterm"></a> on <strong class="userinput"><code>Operations</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Environments</code></strong> through the menu on the left ,you'll be faced with a screen that looks similar to the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/2757ce75-bfbf-4213-9f37-52000c62369d.png" /></div><p>This shows all of the environments that your app has been deployed to which have been defined in your <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. It shows the name of the environment, the deployment and job that deployed to it, as well as the particular commit that has been loaded on it. Next up is the last updated time, followed by two important buttons. The first one links directly to the environment (opening it in a new tab) and is only available if you specified a URL parameter when defining an environment in your <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. The last button allows you to redo the deployment process in case anything went awry the first time.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
