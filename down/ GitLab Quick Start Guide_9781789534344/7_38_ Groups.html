<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec40"></a>Groups</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>So far, we've discussed <span>creating</span><a id="id326296401" class="indexterm"></a> and maintaining projects, issues, and merge requests on GitLab as individual users, but if you're in an organization, especially one with multiple independent teams, you'll probably want to explore the <strong class="userinput"><code>Groups</code></strong> features. You can create groups in GitLab (self-hosted or SaaS) to represent your entire organization, departments, teams, or even sets of people relating to particular products or services.</p><p>To access groups, click the Groups menu at the top of the screen and select <strong class="userinput"><code>Your groups</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/f957124c-8eb2-420b-a99e-013e55708f66.png" /></div><p> </p><p>From here, you can click <strong class="userinput"><code>New group</code></strong> and fill out the form to create a new group. Make sure you provide a name and a group path at least, however it's recommended to provide a description to give more context, as well as an avatar to help represent the group in various menus and views. Make sure you also choose the appropriate privacy settings and then click <strong class="userinput"><code>Create group</code></strong>.</p><p>You should now be looking at your new group. You have the option to create new projects for the group or, using the drop-down menu, you can create a subgroup. This is useful if you want to encapsulate teams within a department, or departments within an organization.</p><p>By clicking <strong class="userinput"><code>Members</code></strong> on the left menu, you're taken to an interface where you can invite other GitLab users to your instance. If they don't currently have an account on your GitLab instance (whether self-hosted or GitLab.com), you can put in their email address and it will send them an invite. You can also preselect their role, which is handy for ensuring people only have permissions that are relevant to their job and can't accidentally delete repositories or commit code if that's not within their duties. For temporary workers or secondments, there's also an expiration date picker so that you can create a time-boxed group membership without having to manually remove them after they've departed. Under the section for adding new members, you'll have a list of existing members, where you can modify their permissions, set expiration dates, or even remove them manually.</p><p>Also on the left menu, you'll see links (with some sub-menus) to <strong class="userinput"><code>Issues</code></strong> and <strong class="userinput"><code>Merge Requests.</code></strong> These allow you to view all the current issues and merge requests for all projects assigned to that particular group. Again, this is handy for getting a good overview of the health of a group whose work might be split across multiple projects. One notable exception is <strong class="userinput"><code>Issues</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Milestones</code></strong>; if you click on that, you'll be taken to an interface where you can view milestones for all projects as well as create group-specific milestones:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/2e7baa61-2214-4a7b-a97f-c00b7e7cbfbc.png" /></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>You'll notice in the preceding screenshot that the first milestone is a <strong class="userinput"><code><span>Project</span><a id="id325174334" class="indexterm"></a> Milestone</code></strong> and includes a link to the project (<strong class="userinput"><code>140charADV</code></strong>), while the second milestone is a <strong class="userinput"><code>Group Milestone</code></strong>. The difference here is that you can assign issues from multiple different projects to this milestone. This is very handy if you have goals that are spread over multiple projects, such as milestones to localize all your frameworks in other languages.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec50"></a>Moving projects</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have an existing <span>project</span><a id="id325179358" class="indexterm"></a> on GitLab but want to move it to a group, follow these easy steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Navigate to your project in the GitLab web user interface.</li><li>In the left menu, go to <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong>.</li><li>Expand the <strong class="userinput"><code>Advanced</code></strong> section.</li><li>Scroll down to <strong class="userinput"><code>Transfer project</code></strong>:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/55850464-10bb-4744-a90c-b943c6d6f579.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Select the group that you want to own the project.

These are a premium feature that allow you to track issues that share a common theme across different group projects and milestones. You'll find the epics section on the left menu when you're looking at a group. You can create a new epic by clicking <strong class="userinput"><code>New epic</code></strong> and providing a title, or you can browse your existing list of epics. When you view an epic, you'll notice that you can edit the title and description, as well as add a start and end date (useful for large organizational projects that have limited timeframes), as well as the ability to add group-specific labels for categorization and tagging:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/4d7f41aa-bffe-4c48-8513-b2ff9bc1993c.png" /></div><p>There's also a section for adding reactions (including thumbs up/thumbs down) and space for comments and discussions. The most important section, though, sits right under the description, and that's the <strong class="userinput"><code>Issues</code></strong> box. You can add issues as they crop up in the <strong class="userinput"><code>Epic</code></strong> by clicking the plus sign, pasting in a link to the issue, and clicking <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the menu on the left, under Epics, you should also have Roadmap. This is useful if you track a lot of time-bound projects using the epics feature, as it shows you the current <span>projected</span><a id="id325484252" class="indexterm"></a> timelines for all the epics. They're automatically sorted by time, but you can choose to filter them further or even search for a particular one:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/92ad8aac-afdb-4a55-b9ee-4f0fc82c5c33.png" /></div><p> </p><p>As you can see, this is a handy way of keeping track of large organizational projects and work, as well as keeping an eye on deadlines and bottlenecks. You can also track non-development projects with epics in order to keep a wider picture of organizational matters in one place.</p></div></div>
