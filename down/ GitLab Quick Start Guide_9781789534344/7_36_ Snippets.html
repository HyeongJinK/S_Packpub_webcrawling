<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec38"></a>Snippets</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>If you've come from GitHub, you're probably aware of gists—a method of sharing single files, parts of files, or even just chunks of code or prose. GitLab has a similar feature <span>called</span><a id="id325425744" class="indexterm"></a><strong class="userinput"><code>Snippets</code></strong>, but with some extra features woven into it.</p><p>You can access <strong class="userinput"><code>Snippets</code></strong> by clicking the option for it in the menu at the top of the screen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/1626c432-7aba-41a2-825f-36d5210e09b1.png" /></div><p> </p><p>On this page, you can view your own snippets as well as explore other snippets available on that GitLab instance. If you click <strong class="userinput"><code>New snippet</code></strong>, you'll be faced with the snippet creation screen:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/b9aafd31-0cd5-4217-9f05-b6893fa0e3ca.png" /></div><p> </p><p>Most of the fields on this page are pretty self-explanatory; you can fill out a title for the snippet and add a description in <strong class="userinput"><code>Markdown</code></strong> format (a brief rundown on Markdowns is available in the <a class="link" href="#" linkend="app01">Appendix</a>). Of incredible importance is picking the right visibility level. If you want your notes to be for your eyes only, you'll definitely need to select <strong class="userinput"><code>Private</code></strong>, while the other choices allow some freedom for linking to coworkers or even interested outsiders. Lastly, we get to the <span>main</span><a id="id325169457" class="indexterm"></a> component of snippets: the file/code/writing section. Here, you can paste your <span class="emphasis"><em>snippet</em></span> of work or even an entire file. Here's a tip: put a filename with a relevant extension (such as <code class="literal">.rb</code> for the Ruby language, <code class="literal">.php</code> for PHP, or <code class="literal">.md</code> for Markdown) and, when viewing the snippet, it will have syntax highlighting to help make it more readable. Once you've finished writing your snippet, you can hit <strong class="userinput"><code>Create snippet</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>When you're viewing a snippet, whether your own or someone else's, you'll notice at the bottom that there is room to both react to the snippet with a thumbs up/down or emoji as well as a space for leaving (Markdown-enabled) comments! This way, you can discuss small pieces of work or ideas without having to create a whole new repository for them:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/62c0514a-966f-466b-a9bc-8ab3666dc959.png" /></div><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We've covered most of the basic <span>features</span><a id="id325172260" class="indexterm"></a> of snippets, but one nifty little thing about them is that you can have project-specific snippets too! If you go to a project on GitLab, you'll see there's a <strong class="userinput"><code>Snippets</code></strong> menu item on the left side where you can collate snippets of code or fragments of information that are relevant to a project but not necessarily required in the codebase:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/886fe339-30db-402e-ba00-084a48b6ae8e.png" /></div><p>Next up, we'll take a look at another helpful project-based feature in GitLab: the wiki.</p></div>
