You need some method of keeping track of changes, of being able to revert mistakes in the work, or branch in new directions; and you'll probably want some way of remotely backing up your work in case of fire, theft, or acts of a misbehaving computer. This is where version control systems (also known as VCS) come in handy. They save your work at certain points (<span class="strong"><strong>commits</strong></span>) and can be reverted to earlier states; many <span>VCS</span><a id="id325168905" class="indexterm"></a> offer methods of <span class="strong"><strong>branching</strong></span> so that you can – for example – work on a specific feature without interrupting someone else's work on another component. There are many version control <span>systems</span><a id="id325169326" class="indexterm"></a> on the market, but the most prominent in the public eye would be Git. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that it has a full copy of all of the code that exists on each user's computer, and users can pass patches and changes directly between each other rather than entirely relying on a centralized server.</p><p>Behind the scenes, git is an advanced program that is lightning fast when it comes to performing operations like staging work, committing changes, or swapping between branches. It's efficient at fetching information from remote repositories to help speed up a user's workflow. Unlike most VCS, git doesn't work by storing the changes that happen to each file. Instead, on every commit, git stores a snapshot of the current state of all files. If a file hasn't changed, rather than storing it again, it simply stores a reference to the last saved version of the file.</p><p>When you make a commit, git captures the snapshot and <span>also</span><a id="id325169339" class="indexterm"></a> takes a <span class="strong"><strong>cryptographic hash</strong></span>– a series of complex mathematical operations on the data that produces a unique value – and uses the output of that as a reference to the commit, along with some metadata, such as the author. This snapshot sits on top of the rest of the snapshots/commits that you've taken, and in this way you can think of git snapshots as a series of changesets – operations that add or remove lines – that can be performed on your files to get them to an older or newer state.</p><p>We'll cover more on the higher-level use and commands of Git in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>GitLab Flow</em></span>, when we explore the GitLab flow for branching and merging.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec4"></a>GitLab and Git</h3></div></div></div><p>GitLab is built on top of git so that <span>users</span><a id="id325169368" class="indexterm"></a> who are <span>contributing</span><a id="id325169377" class="indexterm"></a> work (editing code, writing chapters, and so on) to a project will have a copy of the project downloaded/checked out/cloned on their local computer. It provides a web interface for handling many of git's more advanced workflows, and recommends a workflow for interacting with git for the best in productivity, efficiency, and ease of use. We'll cover this workflow in a lot more detail in <a class="ulink" href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/gitlab_quick_start_guide/wp-admin/post.php?post=24&amp;action=edit#post_26" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>GitLab Flow</em></span>, and in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Issues to Merge Requests</em></span>, where we'll explore the merging of branches in the GitLab user interface.</p><p>By acting as a single source of truth for your developers, GitLab can help you avoid conflicts and the double handling of work while maintaining uptime by relying on the battle-tested <a class="ulink" href="http://GitLab.com" target="_blank">GitLab.com</a> platform or your own installation of it, working with tools including geographic replication, disaster recovery, and automated failover.</p></div></div>
