We know that git is a form of version control system that specializes in working in a distributed network and that GitLab is a platform that is based on git but with a lot of powerful features.</p><p>We discussed the features of GitLab, including issue and project management, continuous integration and continuous deployment, code review, and even online code editing. We also looked at self-managed GitLab versus using the online <a class="ulink" href="http://GitLab.com" target="_blank">GitLab.com</a> platform. You should also have an idea of the benefits of moving to a paid GitLab subscription.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll discuss setting up GitLab for self-managed users, and go over both the quick omnibus installation and the manual installation method. We'll also look into how to create an account on a GitLab instance, whether a self-managed one or on <a class="ulink" href="http://GitLab.com" target="_blank">GitLab.com</a>.</p></div>
