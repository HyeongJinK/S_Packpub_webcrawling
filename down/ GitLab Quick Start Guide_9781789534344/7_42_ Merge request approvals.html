<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec44"></a>Merge request approvals</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>One powerful feature for high-performance teams who want to ensure all submitted code is of the <span>highest</span><a id="id325169449" class="indexterm"></a> quality is merge request approvals. This is available to all Starter/Bronze enterprise subscriptions and above. It takes two main forms, which can be intermixed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Requiring approval from a certain number of users before a merge is allowed</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Requiring merge approval from select users/groups before a merge is allowed</li></ul></div><p>By mixing these together, you can also have combinations such as requiring a certain number of people from a particular group, or requiring at least the project owner plus one other person to approve a merge request before it can be completed. For example, you might want to allow anyone to contribute work to your backend API, but before a merge, the code must be reviewed by a senior developer or perhaps any new SVG icons require two designers to give their approval before inclusion.</p><p>When you're viewing a repository as a project owner, under <strong class="userinput"><code>Settings</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>General</code></strong> | <strong class="userinput"><code>Merge Requests,</code></strong> you'll find the following section:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789534344/graphics/5cecc5ea-ed4a-4d61-a37a-9b043b0736f9.png" /></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>Here, you can specify a list of approvers by typing in users or groups. It works as a search suggestion, so as you start typing, the form will provide suggestions you can click. Once you've chosen a few, you can click the <strong class="userinput"><code>Add</code></strong> button to have them added to the <strong class="userinput"><code>Approvers</code></strong> box. You'll also notice the <strong class="userinput"><code>Approvals required</code></strong> box, which takes an integer value. This allows you to select the minimum number of approvals required before a request can be merged.</p><p>The first checkbox allows users to overwrite the <span>preceding</span><a id="id325169347" class="indexterm"></a> settings. This is handy if you want the settings to be a guideline rather than a limitation. The second box is a setting that will automatically remove any approvals when new work is added to the branch that is being merged. This means that if someone opens a merge request and their code is reviewed and approved and then they add more code, it will wipe those two approvals and prevent a merge until the code is re-reviewed. This is useful to prevent code being merged when potentially unreviewed work has been added.</p></div>
