This requires extra tools, usually a specialized platform that handles testing newly committed code as well as other tools that can take that code and package it for release, or upload it to a new version of the platform of website. However, if you're using GitLab, you have all the tools you need to get up and running and practicing CI/CD in no time.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to install GitLab Runner</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up tests in our GitLab example project</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up a <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file in our GitLab example project</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Breaking down advanced <code class="literal">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The CI/CD interface in GitLab</li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you'll have a good idea of how to navigate GitLab's CI/CD features and be ready to start integrating it into your own project.</p></div>
