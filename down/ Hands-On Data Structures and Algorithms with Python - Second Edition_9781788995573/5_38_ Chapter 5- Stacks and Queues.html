We are still sticking to linear structures. We will get into the details of more complex data structures in the coming chapters.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to understand the concepts of stacks and queues. We will also implement these data structures in Python using various methods such as <code class="literal">lists</code> and <code class="literal">node</code>.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing stacks and queues using various methods</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Some real-life example applications of stacks and queues</li></ul></div></div>
