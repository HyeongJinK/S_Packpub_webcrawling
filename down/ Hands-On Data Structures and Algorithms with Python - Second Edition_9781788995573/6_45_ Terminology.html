A tree is a data structure in which data is organized in a hierarchical form. The following diagram contains a typical tree consisting of character nodes lettered <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> through to <span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/054525ac-36fe-493f-8626-a9706e539a2d.png" /></div><p>He<span>re is a list of terms associated</span> with a tree:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Node</strong></span>: Each <span>circled</span><a id="id325851490" class="indexterm"></a> letter in the preceding diagram represents a node. A node is any data structure that actually stores the data.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Root node</strong></span>: The <span>root</span><a id="id325851504" class="indexterm"></a> node is the first node from which all other nodes in the tree are attached. In every tree, there is always one unique root node. The root node in our example tree is node A.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sub-tree</strong></span>: A sub-tree of a <span>tree</span><a id="id325855478" class="indexterm"></a> is a tree with its nodes being a descendant of some other tree. For example, nodes F, K, and L form a sub-tree of the original tree consisting of all the nodes.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Degree</strong></span>: The total number of children of the given node is <span>called</span><a id="id325855492" class="indexterm"></a> the <span class="strong"><strong>degree of that node</strong></span>. A tree consisting of only one node has a degree of 0. The degree of node A in the preceding diagram is 2, the degree of node B is 3, the degree of node C is 3, and similarly, the degree of node G is 1.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Leaf node</strong></span>: The <span>leaf</span><a id="id325855510" class="indexterm"></a> node does not have any children, and is the terminal node of the given tree. The degree of the leaf node is always 0. In the preceding diagram, the nodes J, E, K, L, H, M, and I are all leaf nodes.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Edge</strong></span>: The connection <span>among</span><a id="id325855558" class="indexterm"></a> any given two nodes in the tree is called an <span class="strong"><strong>edge</strong></span>. The total number of edges in a given tree will be a maximum of one less than the total nodes in the tree. An example edge is shown in the preceding sample tree structure.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Parent</strong></span>: A node in the <span>tree</span><a id="id325855576" class="indexterm"></a> which has a further sub-tree is the parent node of that sub-tree. For example, node B is the parent of nodes D, E, and F, and node F is the parent of nodes K and L. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Child</strong></span>: This is a <span>node</span><a id="id325855590" class="indexterm"></a> connected to its parent, and it is the node that is a descendant of that node. For example, nodes B and C are children of node A, while the nodes H, G, and I are the children of node C. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sibling</strong></span>: All nodes with the same <span>parent</span><a id="id325855604" class="indexterm"></a> are siblings. For example, nodes B and C are siblings, and, similarly, nodes D, E, and F are also siblings. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Level</strong></span>: The root node of the <span>tree</span><a id="id325860329" class="indexterm"></a> is considered to be at level 0. The children of the root node are considered at level 1, and the children of the nodes at level 1 are considered at level 2, and so on. For example, the root node is at level 0, nodes B and C are at level 1, and nodes D, E, F, H, G, and I are at level 2.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Height of a tree</strong></span>: The total number of the nodes in the longest path of the <span>tree</span><a id="id325895053" class="indexterm"></a> is the height of a tree. For example, in the preceding example tree, the height of the tree is 4 as the longest paths, <code class="literal">A-B-D-J</code> or <code class="literal">A-C-G-M</code> or <code class="literal">A-B-F-K</code>, all have a total number of 4 nodes each.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Depth</strong></span>: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root of the tree to that node. In the preceding <span>tree</span><a id="id325896238" class="indexterm"></a> example, the depth of node H is 2.</li></ul></div><p>We shall begin our treatment of trees by considering the node in a tree and abstracting a class.</p></div>
