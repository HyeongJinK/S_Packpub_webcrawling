In this section, we discuss the N, NP, NP-Complete, and NP-Hard complexity classes.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec85"></a>P versus NP</h3></div></div></div><p>The advent of computers has sped up the rate at which certain tasks can be performed. In general, computers are good at perfecting the art of calculation and solving problems that can be <span>reduced</span><a id="id326175862" class="indexterm"></a> to a set of mathematical computations.</p><p>However, this assertion is not entirely true. There are some classes of problems that take an enormous amount of time for the computer to make a sound guess, let alone find the right solution.</p><p>In computer science, the class of problems that computers can solve within polynomial time using a step-wise process of logical steps is known as P-type, where P stands for polynomial. These are relatively easy to solve.</p><p>Then there is another class of problems that are considered very hard to solve. The word <span class="emphasis"><em>hard problem</em></span> is used to refer to the way in which problems increase in difficulty when trying to find a solution. However, despite the fact that these problems have a high growth rate of difficulty, it is possible to determine whether a proposed solution solves the problem in polynomial time. These are known as NP-type problems. NP here stands for nondeterministic polynomial time.</p><p>Now the million dollar question is, does <span class="emphasis"><em>P = NP</em></span>?</p><p> </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p><span>The proof for P<span class="emphasis"><em> = NP</em></span> is one of the M</span>illennium Prize Problems from the Clay Mathematics Institute, offering a million dollar prize for a correct solution. </p></div><p>The <span>Traveling</span><a id="id326175817" class="indexterm"></a> Salesman problem is an example of an NP-type problem. The problem statement says: given <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> number of cities in a country, find the shortest route between them all, thus making the trip a cost-effective one.</p><p>When the number of cities is small, this problem can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. However, when the number of cities is above any two-digit number, the time taken by the computer is remarkably long.</p><p>A lot of computer and cybersecurity systems are based on the RSA encryption algorithm. The strength of the algorithm is based on the fact that it uses the integer factoring problem, which is an NP-type problem.</p><p>Finding the prime factors of a prime number composed of many digits is very difficult. When two large prime numbers are multiplied, a large non-prime number is obtained. Factorization of this number is where many cryptographic algorithms borrow their strength. </p><p>All P-type problems are subsets of <span class="strong"><strong>NP</strong></span> problems. This means that any problem that can be solved in polynomial time can also be verified in polynomial time:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/aeb0f4c2-7791-423c-bf8b-0c9bc0a4cb36.png" /></div><p>But <span class="strong"><strong>P</strong></span> = <span class="strong"><strong>NP</strong></span> investigates whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. In particular, if they are equal, it means that problems that are solved by trying a number of possible solutions can be solved without the need to actually try all the possible solutions, invariably creating some sort of shortcut proof.</p><p>The proof, when finally discovered, will certainly have serious consequences for the fields of cryptography, game theory, mathematics, and many other fields.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl2sec86"></a>NP-Hard</h3></div></div></div><p>A problem is NP-Hard if all other problems in NP <span>can</span><a id="id326166548" class="indexterm"></a> be polynomial-time-reducible, or mapped to it.
