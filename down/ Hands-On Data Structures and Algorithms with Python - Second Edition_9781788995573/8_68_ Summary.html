The subject of graphs is very important and useful for many<span> real-world</span> applications. We have looked at different ways to represent a graph in Python, using lists and dictionaries. In order to traverse the graph, we used two methods: BFS and DFS.</p><p>We then switched our attention to heaps and priority queues, in order to understand their implementation. The chapter ended with a discussion on using the concept of a heap to find the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code>-smallest element in a list.</p><p>The next chapter will usher us into the arena of searching, and the various methods by which we can efficiently search for items in lists.</p></div>
