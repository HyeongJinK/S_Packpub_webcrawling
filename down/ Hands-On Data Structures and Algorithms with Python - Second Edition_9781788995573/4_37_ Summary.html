We studied the concepts that underlie lists, such as nodes and pointers to other nodes. We implemented the major operations that occur in these types of lists and saw how the worst-case running times compare.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to look at two other data structures that are usually implemented using listsâ€”stacks and queues.</p></div>
