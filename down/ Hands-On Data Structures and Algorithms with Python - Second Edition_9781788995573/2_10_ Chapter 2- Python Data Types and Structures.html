We have already introduced two data types, the string and list, <code class="literal">str()</code> and <code class="literal">list()</code>. However, these data types are not sufficient, and we often need more specialized data objects to represent/store our data. Python has various other standard data types that are used to store and manage data, which we will be discussing in this chapter. In addition to the built-in types, there are several internal modules that allow us to address common issues when working with data structures. First, we are going to review some operations and expressions that are c<span>ommon to all data types, and we will</span> discuss more related to data types in Python.</p><p>This chapter's objectives are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding various important built-in data types supported in Python 3.7</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exploring various additional collections of high-performance alternatives to built-in data types</li></ul></div></div>
