Sorting is one of the most important issues in data structures and computing. Data is regularly sorted before being sorted, as it can then very efficiently be retrieved, be it a collection of names, telephone numbers, or items on a simple to-do list. </p><p>In this chapter, we'll study some of the most important and popular sorting techniques, including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Bubble sort</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Insertion sort</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Selection sort</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Quick sort</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Heap sort</li></ul></div><p>In this chapter, we compare different sorting algorithms by considering their asymptotic behavior. Some of the algorithms are relatively easy to develop, but may perform poorly, whereas other algorithms are slightly more complex to implement, but show good performance in sorting the list when we have a long lists. </p><p>After sorting, it becomes much easier to conduct search operations on a collection of items. We'll start with the simplest of all sorting algorithms; that is, the bubble sort algorithm.</p></div>
