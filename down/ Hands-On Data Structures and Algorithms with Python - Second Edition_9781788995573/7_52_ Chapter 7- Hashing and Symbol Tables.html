Index numbers work well for computers. They are integers so they are fast and easy to manipulate. However, they don't always work so well for us. For e<span>xample, if we have an address boo</span>k entry, let's say at index number 56, that number doesn't tell us much. There is nothing to link a particular contact with number 56. It is difficult to retrieve an entry from the list using the index value. </p><p>In this chapter, we are going to look at a data structure that is better suited to this kind of problem: a dictionary. A dictionary uses a keyword instead of an index number, and it stores data in <code class="literal">(key, value)</code> pairs. So, if that contact was called <span class="emphasis"><em>James</em></span>, we would probably use the keyword <span class="emphasis"><em>James</em></span> to locate the contact. That is, instead of accessing the contact by calling <span class="emphasis"><em>contacts [56]</em></span>, we would use <span class="emphasis"><em>contacts</em></span><code class="literal">james</code>. </p><p>Dictionaries are a widely used data structure, often built using hash tables. As the name suggests, hash tables rely on a concept called <span class="strong"><strong>hashing</strong></span>. A hash table data structure stores the data in <code class="literal">key/value</code> pairs, where keys are obtained by applying a hash function to it. It stores the data in a very efficient way so that retrieval can be very fast. We will discuss all the related issues in this chapter.</p><p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Hashing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Hash tables</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Different functions with elements</li></ul></div><p> </p><p> </p></div>
