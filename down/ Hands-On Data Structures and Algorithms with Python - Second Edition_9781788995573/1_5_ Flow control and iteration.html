The interpreter executes each statement in <span>order</span><a id="id326581735" class="indexterm"></a> until there are no more statements. This is true if files run as the main program, as well as if they are loaded via <code class="literal">import</code>. All statements, including variable assignment, function definitions, class definitions, and <span>module</span><a id="id326469690" class="indexterm"></a> imports, have equal status. There are no special statements that have higher priority than any other, and every statement can be placed anywhere in a program. All the instructions/statements in the program <span>are executed in sequence in general</span>. However, there are two main ways of controlling the flow of program execution—conditional statements and loops.</p><p>The <code class="literal">if...else</code> and <code class="literal">elif</code> statements control the conditional execution of statements. The general format is a series of <code class="literal">if</code> and <code class="literal">elif</code> statements followed by a final <code class="literal">else</code> statement:</p><pre class="programlisting">x='one' 
if x==0:
   print('False')
elif  x==1:
   print('True')
else:  print('Something else')

#prints'Something else'</pre><p>Note the use of the <code class="literal">==</code> operator to compare the two values. This returns <code class="literal">True</code> if both the values are equal; it returns <code class="literal">False</code> otherwise. Note also that setting <code class="literal">x</code> to a string will return <code class="literal">Something else</code> rather than generate a type error as may happen in languages that are not dynamically typed. Dynamically typed languages, such as Python, allow flexible assignment of objects with different types.</p><p>The other way of controlling program flow is with loops. Python offers two ways of constructing looping, such as the <code class="literal">while</code> and <code class="literal">for</code> loop statements. A <code class="literal">while</code> loop repeats executing statements until a Boolean condition is true. A <code class="literal">for</code> loop provides a way of repeating the execution into the loop through a series of elements. Here is an example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/9e82550d-158d-43f6-91ec-dbd7b45c9c68.png" /></div><p>In this example, the <code class="literal">while</code> loop executes the statements until the condition <code class="literal">x &lt; 3</code> is true. Let's consider another example that uses a <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> loop:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>words = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant']
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; </strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>for</strong></span> w <span class="strong"><strong>in</strong></span> words:
<span class="strong"><strong>... </strong></span>    print(w)
<span class="strong"><strong>...
</strong></span>
cat
dog
elephant</pre><p>In this example, the<span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span>loop executes <span>iterating</span> for all the items over the list.</p></div>
