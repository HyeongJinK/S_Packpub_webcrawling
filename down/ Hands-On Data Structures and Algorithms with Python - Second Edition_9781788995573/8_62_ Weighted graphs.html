It can be either a directed or an undirected graph. This <span>numerical</span><a id="id325855559" class="indexterm"></a> value can possibly be used to indicate distance or cost, depending upon the purpose of the graph. Let's consider an example. The following <span>graph</span><a id="id325855518" class="indexterm"></a> indicates different ways to get from the <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> node to the <span class="strong"><strong>D </strong></span>node. You can either go straight from <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span>, or choose to pass through <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>C,</strong></span> considering that the associated weight with each edge is the amount of time, in minutes, for the journey to the next node:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/01835ed2-f4da-4268-ae01-e048c84e6e28.png" /></div><p>In this example, <span class="strong"><strong>AD</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>ABCD</strong></span> represent two different paths. A path is simply a sequence of edges that you pass through between two nodes. Following these paths, you see that the <span class="strong"><strong>AD</strong></span> journey takes <span class="strong"><strong>40</strong></span> minutes, whereas the <span class="strong"><strong>ABCD</strong></span>journey takes <span class="strong"><strong>25</strong></span> minutes. If the only concern is time, then it would be better to travel along the <span class="strong"><strong>ABCD </strong></span>path, even though it may be a longer route. The point to take away here is that edges can be directed and may hold other information (for example, time taken, distance to be traveled, and so on).</p><p>We can implement our <span>graphs</span><a id="id325837849" class="indexterm"></a> in a similar manner to what we have done with other data structures, such as linked lists. With graphs, it makes sense to see edges as objects, just as nodes. Just like nodes, edges can also contain extra information <span>that makes it</span> necessary to follow a particular path. The edges in the graphs can be represented using the links between different nodes; if there is a directed edge in the graph, we can implement it with an arrow pointing from one node to another, which is easy to <span>represent</span><a id="id325644862" class="indexterm"></a> in the node class by using <code class="literal">next</code> or <code class="literal">previous</code>, <code class="literal">parent</code>, or <code class="literal">child</code>.</p></div>
