However, one of the most important, popular, and useful string processing problems is to find a given substring or pattern from some given text. <span></span>It has various application uses, such as searching an element from a text document, plagiarism detection, and so on. </p><p>In this chapter, we will study the standard string processing or pattern matching algorithms that find out the locations of the given pattern or substring in some given text. We will also be discussing the brute-force algorithm, as well as the Rabin-Karp, <span class="strong"><strong>Knuth-Morris-Pratt</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>KMP</strong></span>), and Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithms. We will also discuss some basic concepts related to strings. We will be discussing all of the algorithms with an easy explanation, including examples and implementation.</p><p>This chapter is aimed at discussing algorithms that are focused on being related to strings. The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learning the basic concepts of strings in Python </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learning pattern matching algorithms and their implementation</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding and implementing the Rabin-Karp pattern matching algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding and implementing the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding and implementing the Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithm</li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
