The connecting edges can be considered directed or undirected. If the connecting edges in a <span>graph</span><a id="id325837828" class="indexterm"></a> are undirected, then the <span>graph</span><a id="id325837821" class="indexterm"></a> is called an undirected graph, and if the connecting edges in a graph are directed, then it is called a directed graph. An <span>undirected</span><a id="id325644880" class="indexterm"></a> graph simply represents edges as lines between the nodes. There is no additional information about the relationship between the nodes, other than the fact that they are connected. For example, in the following diagram, we demonstrate an <span>undirected</span><a id="id325837808" class="indexterm"></a> graph of four nodes, <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span>, which are connected using edges:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/f2acc670-0aef-44c8-bbdd-9e54af34f227.png" /></div><p>In a directed graph, the edges provide the information on the direction of connection between any two nodes in a graph. If an edge from node <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span> is said to be directed, then the edge (<span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>) would not be equal to the edge (<span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>). The directed edges are drawn as lines with arrows, which will point in whichever direction the edge connects the two nodes. For example, in the following diagram, we show a directed graph where many nodes are connected using directed edges:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/5a18cf1b-1071-4676-a8ff-3e692a52610d.png" /></div><p>The arrow of an edge <span>determines</span><a id="id325644836" class="indexterm"></a> the flow of direction. One can only <span>move</span><a id="id325644843" class="indexterm"></a> from <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span>, as shown in the preceding diagram—not <span class="strong"><strong>B</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>. In a <span>directed</span><a id="id325855585" class="indexterm"></a> graph, each node (or vertex) has an <span>indegree</span><a id="id325855591" class="indexterm"></a> and an outdegree. Let's have a look at what these are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Indegree</strong></span>: The total number of edges that come into a vertex in the graph is called the indegree of that vertex. For example, in the previous diagram, the <span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span> node has <code class="literal">1</code> indegree, due to edge <span class="strong"><strong>CE</strong></span> coming into the <span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span> node.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Outdegree</strong></span>: The total number of edges that goes out from a vertex in the graph is called the outdegree of that vertex. For example, the <span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span>node in the previous diagram has an outdegree of<code class="literal">2</code>, as it has two edges,<span class="strong"><strong>EF</strong></span>and<span class="strong"><strong>ED</strong></span>, going out of that node.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Isolated vertex</strong></span>:<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>A node or vertex is called an isolated vertex when it has a degree of zero.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Source vertex</strong></span>: A vertex is called a source vertex if it has an indegree of zero. For example, in the previous diagram, the<span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> node is the source vertex.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sink</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>vertex</strong></span>:A vertex is a sink vertex if that has an outdegree of zero. For example, in the previous diagram, the<span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span>node is the sink vertex.</li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
