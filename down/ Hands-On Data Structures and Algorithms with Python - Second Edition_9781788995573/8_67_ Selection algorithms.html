When a list is sorted in ascending order, the first element in the list will be the smallest item in the list. The second element in the list will be the second-smallest element in the list. The last element in the list will be the least-smallest (or, largest) element in the list.</p><p>In creating the heap data structure, we have come to understand that a call to the <code class="literal">pop</code> method will return the smallest element in the min-heap. The first element to pop off a min heap is the smallest element in the list. Similarly, the seventh element to be popped off the min heap will be the seventh-smallest element in the list. Therefore, finding the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code>-smallest element in a list will require us to pop the heap i number of times. This is a very simple and efficient way of finding the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code>-smallest element in a list.</p><p>However, in <span>Chapter 11</span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selection Algorithms</em></span>, we will study more approaches to find the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code>-smallest element in a list.</p><p>Selection algorithms have applications in filtering out noisy data, finding the median, smallest, and largest elements in a list, and can even be applied in computer chess programs.</p></div>
