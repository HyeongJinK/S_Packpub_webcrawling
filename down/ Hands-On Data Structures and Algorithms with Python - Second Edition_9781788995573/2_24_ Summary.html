We looked at the built-in data types and some internal Python modules, most notably the <code class="literal">collections</code> module. There are also several other Python modules that are relevant to the topic of this book, but rather than examining them separately, their use and functionality should become self-evident as we begin using them. There are also a number of external libraries, for example, SciPy.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will introduce the basic theory and techniques of algorithm design.</p></div>
