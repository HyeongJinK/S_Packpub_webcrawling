Symbol tables are often built using hash tables since it is important to efficiently retrieve a symbol from the table.</p><p>Let's look at an example. Suppose we have the following Python code:</p><pre class="programlisting">    name = "Joe" 
    age = 27 </pre><p>Here, we have two symbols, <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">age</code>. They belong to a namespace, which could be <code class="literal">__main__</code>, but it could also be the name of a module if you placed it there. Each symbol has a <code class="literal">value</code>; for example, the <code class="literal">name</code>symbol has the value, <code class="literal">Joe</code>, and the <code class="literal">age</code> symbol has the value, <code class="literal">27</code>. A symbol table allows the compiler or the interpreter to look up these values. So, the <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">age</code>symbols become keys in the hash table. All of the other information associated with them become the <code class="literal">value</code> of the symbol table entry.</p><p>It's not only variables that are symbols, but functions and classes are also treated as symbols, and they will also be added to the symbol table so that, when any one of them needs to be accessed, they are accessible from the symbol table. For example, the <code class="literal">greet()</code> function and two variables are stored in the symbol table in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/92a71b33-722c-4415-9c64-9ec0dc88c5c1.png" /></div><p>In Python, each module that is loaded has its own <span>symbol</span><a id="id326451030" class="indexterm"></a> table. The symbol table is given the name of that module. This way, modules act as namespaces. We can have multiple symbols of the same name as long as they exist in different symbol tables, and we can access them through the appropriate symbol table. See the following example, showing multiple symbol tables in a program:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/86373d42-a983-4e1a-9176-fb67aee2ed57.png" /></div><p> </p></div>
