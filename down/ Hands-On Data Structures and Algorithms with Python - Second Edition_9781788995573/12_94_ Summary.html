We started this chapter by looking at the basic concepts and definitions related to strings. Next, we described the brute-force, Rabin-Karp, KMP, and Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithms in detail for pattern matching problems. We have seen that the brute-force pattern matching algorithm is quite slow as it compared the characters of the pattern and the text string character by character.</p><p>In pattern matching algorithms, we try to find out ways to skip unnecessary comparisons and move the pattern over the text as fast as possible to quickly find out the positions of the matched patterns. The KMP algorithm finds out the unnecessary comparisons by looking at the overlapping substrings in the pattern itself to avoid unimportant comparisons. Furthermore, we discussed the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is very efficient when the text and pattern are long. It is the most popular algorithm that is being used in practice for pattern matching. </p><p>In the next chapter, we will be discussing data structure design strategies and techniques in more detail. </p></div>
