Finding the mean and mode values does not require the list to be ordered. However, to find the median in a list of numbers, the list must first be ordered. Finding the median requires you to find the element in the middle position of the ordered list. In addition, this can be used when we want to find the last-smallest item in the list or the first-smallest item in the list. In such situations, selection algorithms can be useful. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To find the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code> smallest number in an unordered list of items, the index of where that item occurs is important to obtain. Since the elements of the list are not sorted, it is difficult to know whether the element at index 0 in a list is really the first-smallest number.</p><p>A pragmatic and obvious thing to do when dealing with unordered lists is to first sort the list. After the list is sorted, you can rest assured that the element at the 0 index will hold the first-smallest element in the list. Likewise, the last element in the list will hold the last-smallest element in the list. However, it is not a good solution to apply a sorting algorithm on a long list of elements to obtain the minimum or maximum value from the list as sorting is quite an expensive operation. </p><p>Let's discuss if it's possible to find the <code class="literal">i<sup>th</sup></code> smallest element without having to sort the list in the first place.</p></div>
