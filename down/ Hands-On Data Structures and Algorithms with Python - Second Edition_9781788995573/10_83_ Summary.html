We discussed bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and heap sort algorithms, along with the explanation of their implementation in Python. Quick sort performs much better than the other sorting algorithms. Of all the algorithms discussed, quick sort preserves the index of the list that it sorts. We'll use this property in the next chapter as we explore the selection algorithms.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be discussing the concepts related to the selection strategy and algorithms.Â </p></div>
