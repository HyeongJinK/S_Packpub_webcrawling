Heaps are divided into <code class="literal">max</code> heaps and <code class="literal">min</code> heaps.</p><p>In a <code class="literal">max</code> heap, each parent node value must always be greater than or equal to its children. It follows that the root node must be the greatest value in the tree. Consider the following diagram for the max heap, where all the nodes have greater values compared to their children:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/b19eeb84-0341-4a2b-84bc-8bb2d2ddce13.png" /></div><p>In a min heap, each parent node must be <span>less</span><a id="id325955798" class="indexterm"></a> than or equal to both its children. As a consequence, the root node holds the lowest value.Â Consider the following diagram for the min heap, where all the nodes have smaller values compared to their children:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/ef162078-3bce-4b61-99f9-53d746233fdb.png" /></div><p>Heaps are used for a number of <span>different</span><a id="id325955773" class="indexterm"></a> things. For one, they are used to implement priority queues. There is also a very efficient sorting algorithm, called <span class="strong"><strong>heap sort</strong></span>, that uses heaps. We are going to study these in depth in subsequent chapters.</p></div>
