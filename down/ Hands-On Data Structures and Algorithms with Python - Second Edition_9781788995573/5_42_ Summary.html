We have seen how these data structures closely mimic stacks and queues in the real world. Concrete implementations, together with their varying types, were explored. We later applied the concepts of stacks and queues to write real-life programs.</p><p>We shall consider trees in the next chapter. The major operations of a tree will be discussed, and likewise the different spheres in which to apply their data structure.</p></div>
