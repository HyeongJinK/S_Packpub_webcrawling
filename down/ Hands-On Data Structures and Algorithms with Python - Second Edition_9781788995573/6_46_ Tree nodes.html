All of the data items in the linear data structures can be traversed in one pass, whereas this is not possible in the case of a non-linear data structure. The trees are the non-linear data structure; they store the data differently from other linear data structures such as <span class="emphasis"><em>arrays</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>lists,</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>stacks,</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>queues.</em></span></p><p>In the tree data structure, the nodes are arranged in a <span class="emphasis"><em>parent-child</em></span> relationship. There should not be any cycle among the nodes in trees. The tree structure has nodes to form a hierarchy, and a tree that <span>has</span><a id="id325837795" class="indexterm"></a> no node is called an <span class="strong"><strong>empty tree</strong></span>.</p><p>First, we will discuss one of most important and special kinds of trees available, that is, the <span class="emphasis"><em>binary tree.</em></span> A binary tree is a collection of nodes, where the nodes in the tree can have zero, 1, or 2 child nodes. A simple binary tree has a maximum of two children, that is, the left child and the right child. For example, in the following binary tree example, there is a root node that has two children (left child, right child):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/9ff68df9-df3a-4368-a0ff-64d6835a5485.png" /></div><p>A tree is called a <span class="strong"><strong>full</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>binary tree</strong></span> if all the nodes of a <span>binary</span><a id="id325644860" class="indexterm"></a> tree have either zero or two children, and if there is no node that has <code class="literal">1</code> child. A binary tree is called a <span class="strong"><strong>complete binary tree</strong></span> if it is <span>completely</span><a id="id325644846" class="indexterm"></a> filled, with a possible exception at the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.</p><p>Just like in our previous implementations, a node is a container for data and holds references to other nodes. In a binary tree node, these references are to the left and the right children. Let's look at the following code for building a binary tree <code class="literal">node</code> class in Python:</p><pre class="programlisting">    class Node: 
        def __init__(self, data): 
            self.data = data 
            self.right_child = None 
            self.left_child = None </pre><p>To test this class, we must first create four nodes—<code class="literal">n1</code>, <code class="literal">n2</code>, <code class="literal">n3</code>, and <code class="literal">n4</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">    n1 = Node("root node")  
    n2 = Node("left child node") 
    n3 = Node("right child node") 
    n4 = Node("left grandchild node") </pre><p>Next, we connect the nodes to each other according to the property of a binary tree. We let <code class="literal">n1</code> be the root node, with <code class="literal">n2</code> and <code class="literal">n3</code> as its children. Finally, we take <code class="literal">n4</code> as the left child to <code class="literal">n2</code>. Take a look at the following diagram to see how we connect these nodes to each other:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788995573/graphics/fdc5d5cd-0fe0-4d6d-8d44-227352c9f09c.png" /></div><p>The next code snippet should be following in order to connect the nodes to each other according to the preceding diagram: </p><pre class="programlisting">    n1.left_child = n2 
    n1.right_child = n3 
    n2.left_child = n4 </pre><p>Here, we have set a very simple tree structure of four nodes. The first important operation that we would like to perform on trees is traversal. To understand traversing, let's traverse the left sub-tree of this binary tree. We will start from the root node, print out the node, and move down the tree to the next left node. We keep doing this until we have reached the end of the left sub-tree, like so:</p><pre class="programlisting">    current = n1 
    while current: 
        print(current.data) 
        current = current.left_child </pre><p>The output of traversing the preceding code block is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>root node </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>left child node </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>left grandchild node</strong></span></pre></div>
