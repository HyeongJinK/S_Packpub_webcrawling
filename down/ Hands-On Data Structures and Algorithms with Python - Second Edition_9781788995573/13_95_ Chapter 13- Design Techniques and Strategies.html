As your experience with programming grows, certain patterns start to become apparent. The world of algorithms contains a plethora of techniques and design principles. A mastery of these techniques is required to tackle harder problems in the field.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the ways in which different kinds of algorithms can be categorized. Design techniques will be described and illustrated. We will also further discuss the analysis of algorithms. Finally, we will provide detailed implementations for a few very important algorithms.</p><p>This chapter will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The classification of algorithms</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Various algorithm design methodologies</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The implementation and explanation of various important algorithms</li></ul></div></div>
