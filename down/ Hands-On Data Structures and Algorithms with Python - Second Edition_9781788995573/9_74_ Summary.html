The implementation of both linear and binary search algorithms were discussed and their comparisons drawn. The binary search variant, interpolation search, was also discussed in detail in this chapter.</p><p>We will be using the concepts of searching for sorting algorithms in the next chapter.Â We will also use the knowledge that we have gained to perform sorting algorithms on a list of items.</p></div>
