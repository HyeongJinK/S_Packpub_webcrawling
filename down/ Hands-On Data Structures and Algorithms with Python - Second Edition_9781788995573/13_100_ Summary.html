Without too much mathematical rigor, we also discussed some of the main categories into which algorithms are classified.</p><p>Other design techniques in the field, such as the divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms, were also covered, along with implementations of important sample algorithms.Â  Lastly, we presented a brief discussion on complexity classes. We saw how proof for P = NP will definitely be a game-changer in a number of fields, if such a proof is ever discovered.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be discussing some <span>real-world applications, tools, and the basics of machine learning applications</span>.</p></div>
