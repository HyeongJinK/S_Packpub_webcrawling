We studied binary trees in particular, which is a subtype of tree where each node has two children at most. We also looked at how a binary tree can be used as a searchable data structure with a BST. The breadth-first and depth-first search traversal modes were also implemented in Python by using queue recursion.</p><p><span>We also looked at how a binary tree</span> can be used to represent an arithmetic or a Boolean expression. We then built an expression tree to represent an arithmetic expression. Afterward, we showed you how to use a stack to parse an expression written in RPN, build up the expression tree, and finally traverse it to get the result of the arithmetic expression.</p><p>Finally, we mentioned heaps, a specialization of a tree structure. We have tried to at least lay down the theoretical foundation for the heap in this chapter so that we can go on to implement heaps for different purposes in upcoming chapters.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be discussing the details of hash tables and symbol tables. </p></div>
