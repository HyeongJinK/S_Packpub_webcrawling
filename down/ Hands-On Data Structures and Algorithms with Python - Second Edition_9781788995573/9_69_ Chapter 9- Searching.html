There are various methods to search for an element in the data structures; in this chapter, we shall explore the different strategies that can be used to find elements in a collection of items.</p><p>The searching operation is a very important operation for sorting. It is virtually impossible to sort the data without using some variant of a search operation. The sorting algorithm will be fast if the searching algorithm is efficient. In this chapter, we will be discussing different searching algorithms.</p><p>The performance of a search operation is heavily influenced by whether the items about to be searched have already been sorted or not, as we will see in the subsequent sections.</p><p><span>By the end of this chapter, you</span> will be able to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand various searching algorithms</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand the implementation of the popular searching algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand the implementation of the binary searching algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understand the implementation of interpolation </li></ul></div></div>
