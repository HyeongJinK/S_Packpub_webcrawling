As with any other data type, such as an int or float, we need to store the data and operations that have to be applied to them. String data types allow us to store the data, and Python provides a rich set of operations and functions that can be applied to the data of the string data type. Most of the operations and functions provided by Python 3.7 that can be applied to the strings were described in detail in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Python Objects, Types, and Expressions</em></span>.</p><p>Strings are mainly textual data that is generally handled very efficiently. The following is an <span>example</span><a id="id325614829" class="indexterm"></a> of a string (S)—<code class="literal">"packt publishing"</code>. </p><p>A <span>substring</span><a id="id325614843" class="indexterm"></a> is also a sequence of characters that's part of the given string. For example, <code class="literal">"packt"</code> is the substring for the string<code class="literal">"packt publishing"</code>.</p><p>A <span>subsequence</span><a id="id325631150" class="indexterm"></a> is a sequence of characters that can be obtained from the given string by removing some of the characters from the string but by keeping the order of occurrence of the characters. For example, <code class="literal">"pct pblishing"</code> is a valid subsequence for the string <code class="literal">"packt publishing"</code> that is obtained by removing the characters <code class="literal">a</code>, <code class="literal">k</code>, and <code class="literal">u</code>. However, this is not a substring. A subsequence is different from a substring, since it can be considered as a generalization of substrings.</p><p>The prefix of a string, <code class="literal">s</code>, is the substring of <code class="literal">s</code> in that it is present in the starting of the string. There is also another string, <code class="literal">u</code>, that exists in the string s after the prefix. For example, the substring <code class="literal">"pack"</code> is a prefix for the string <code class="literal">(s) = "packt publishing"</code> as it is starting the substring and there is another substring after it.</p><p>The suffix <code class="literal">(d)</code> is a substring that is present at the end of the string (s) so that there is another nonempty substring existing before substring d. For example, the substring <code class="literal">"shing"</code> is the suffix for the string <code class="literal">"packt publishing"</code>. Python has built-in functions to check whether a string has a given prefix or suffix, as shown in the following code snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span>string </span><span>=</span><span></span><span>"this is data structures book by packt publisher"</span><span>;
</span><span>suffix </span><span>=</span><span></span><span>"publisher"</span><span>;
</span><span>prefix = "this";

</span><span>print(</span><span>string</span><span>.</span><span>endswith</span><span>(</span><span>suffix</span><span>))  #Check if string contains given suffix.
print(string.startswith(prefix)) #Check if string starts with given prefix.

#Outputs
&gt;&gt;True
&gt;&gt;True</span></pre><p>Pattern matching algorithms are the most important string processing algorithms, and we will be discussing them in subsequent sections. </p></div>
