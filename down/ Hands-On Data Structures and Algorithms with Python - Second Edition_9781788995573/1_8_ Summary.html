We described various data structures and algorithms provided by the python. We covered the use of variables, lists, a couple of control structures, and learned how to use <span>the conditional statement</span>. We also discussed how functions are used in python.  The various kinds of objects were discussed, together with some materials on the object-oriented aspects of the Python language. We created our own objects and inherited from <span>them.</span></p><p><span>There is still more that Python offers. As we pr</span>epare to examine the later chapters on some implementations of algorithms, the next chapter will focus on numbers, sequences, maps, and sets. These are also data types in Python that prove useful when organizing data for a series of operations.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
