The first thing we're going to do is open our terminal and create our blockchain directory by typing commands into the terminal, as seen in the following screenshot: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/a9de216c-6894-4ab5-8aed-fae551b24d8d.png" /></div><p>Let's begin by creating a folder called <code class="literal">programs</code>. Inside this folder, let's create a directory called <code class="literal">blockchain</code>. This directory is currently empty.  Inside of this <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory is where we're going to be doing all of our programming. We are going to be building our entire blockchain inside of this <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory.</p><p>Now our <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory is ready, and the first thing that we need to do is to add some folders and files into it. The first folder that we want to put into the directory will be called <code class="literal">dev</code>, so we want to make sure that we are inside of the <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory, and then let's type the following command into the terminal: </p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>mkdir dev</strong></span></pre><p>Inside this <code class="literal">dev</code> directory is where we are going to be doing most of our coding. This is where we're going to build our blockchain data structure and create our API to interact with our blockchain, test it, and fulfill other similar tasks. Next, inside this <code class="literal">dev</code> folder, let's create two files: <code class="literal">blockchain.js</code> and <code class="literal">test.js</code>.  To do this, enter the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>cd dev
touch blockchain.js test.js</strong></span></pre><p>The <code class="literal">touch</code> term in the preceding command line will help us in creating the mentioned files. The <code class="literal">blockchain.js</code> file is where we will type our code to create the blockchain and the <code class="literal">test.js</code> file is where we will write code to test our blockchain.</p><p>Next, let's return back to our <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory by typing the following command in the terminal:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>cd ..</strong></span></pre><p>In the <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory, let's run the <span>following</span><a id="id325704652" class="indexterm"></a> command to create the npm project: </p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>npm init</strong></span></pre><p>After running the preceding command, you will get some options on your terminal. To set up the project, you can just press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> through those options.</p><p>So, this is pretty much all we need to do in order to set up our project folder structure. Now, if you go to our <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory and open it with a text editor such as Sublime or Atom (or whatever you would like), you will get to see the file structure, as seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/c4b318e7-371c-4e42-b6fe-2314843c39fb.png" /></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>The <code class="literal">blockchain</code> directory consists of the <code class="literal">dev</code> folder that we just created. Inside the <code class="literal">dev</code> folder, we can observe our <code class="literal">blockchain.js</code> and <code class="literal">test.js</code> files. Also, when we run the <code class="literal">npm init</code> command, it creates the <code class="literal">package.json</code> file for us. This <code class="literal">.json</code> file will keep track of our project and any dependencies that we need, allowing us to run scripts. We'll be working more inside of this <code class="literal">package.json</code> file in further chapters, so you'll become more familiar with it as we progress through the book.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec3"></a>Project source code</h3></div></div></div><p><span>Before we start coding our blockchain,</span> it is worth <span>noting</span><a id="id325691044" class="indexterm"></a> that the entire source code for this book  can be found on GitHub at the following link: <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Blockchain-Programming-with-JavaScript" target="_blank">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Blockchain-Programming-with-JavaScript</a>. <span>In this repository, you'll find the completed code for the entire project, and you will also be able to explore all of the </span>files that we will be building in further chapters.
