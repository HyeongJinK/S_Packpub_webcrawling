We then learned about the hashing method, SHA256 hashing, and created a method to generate a hash for our block data. We also learned what a proof of work is and how this works. In this chapter, you also got to learn how to test the various methods that we created and check whether they are working as expected. The methods that we have learned about in this chapter will be very useful for us in further chapters when we interact more with the blockchain.</p><p>If you want to get more familiar with the blockchain data structure, it is recommended that you open up the <code class="literal">test.js</code> file, test all of the methods, try to play around with those, observe how they work together, and have fun with it.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll be building an API to interact with and use our blockchain. That's where the real fun begins.</p></div>
