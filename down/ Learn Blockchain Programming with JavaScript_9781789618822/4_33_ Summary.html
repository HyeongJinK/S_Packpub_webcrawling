In this chapter, we learned about a lot of new concepts. We began our journey by learning about how to create the multiple instances of our API and how to use them to set up our decentralized network. We then defined various endpoints such as <code class="literal">register-and-broadcast-node</code>, <code class="literal">register-node</code>, and <code class="literal">register-nodes-bulk</code>. After this, we built these endpoints and tested them. </p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to synchronize the network.  </p></div>
