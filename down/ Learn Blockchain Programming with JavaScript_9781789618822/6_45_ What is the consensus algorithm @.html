There's a possibility that during these broadcasts a hiccup could occur, or maybe a certain node doesn't receive a piece of information or a transaction that took place.</p><p>There could even be a bad actor inside of the blockchain network, who is sending out false information or creating fraudulent transactions on their copy of a blockchain, and trying to broadcast them to the whole network to convince everybody that they are legitimate transactions. So, how do we solve this problem so that there are only legitimate blocks in the blockchain network? </p><p> </p><p>This is where the consensus algorithm is going to help us out. The consensus algorithm will provide us with a way to compare one node to all the other nodes inside of the network to confirm that we have the correct data on that specific node. There are currently many different consensus algorithms out there being used for different blockchain networks. For our blockchain network, we're going to create a consensus algorithm that implements the <span class="emphasis"><em>longest chain rule</em></span>.</p><p>Basically, the <span class="emphasis"><em>longest chain rule</em></span> takes a look at a single node and the copy of the blockchain on that node, comparing the length of the chains on one node with the length of the chains on all the other nodes. During this comparison, if there is a chain found that has a longer length than the chain that's present on the chosen node, the algorithm is going to replace the chain that's on the chosen node with the longest chain in the network.</p><p>The theory behind using this is that we should be able to trust the longest chain to hold the correct data, because the most work was put into creating that chain. The longest chain has the most blocks in it and each of those blocks was mined by using a proof of work. Consequently, we can assume that the whole network contributed to the longest chain because of how much work went into that chain. For this reason, we're going to use a consensus algorithm that implements the longest chain rule. The <span>Bitcoin</span><a id="id325458944" class="indexterm"></a> blockchain network itself actually implements this longest chain rule in real life.</p></div>
