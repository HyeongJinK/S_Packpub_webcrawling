Throughout this book, we didn't do much error handling, because we were focusing on getting the actual functionalities to work correctly, but to improve this blockchain we would definitely want to do a lot of error handling. This would ensure that our blockchain can't be hacked, and also make sure that it runs correctly.</p><p>Another area where this <span>blockchain</span><a id="id325442666" class="indexterm"></a> could be improved is when we are making transactions. Right now, when we make transactions, we send a certain amount of Bitcoin from one person to another, but at no point do we validate that the sender actually has this bitcoin to send.</p><p>One exercise we would encourage you to do is to go to our <code class="literal">createTransaction</code> method in our blockchain data structure, and then find a way to verify that the sender actually has the amount of Bitcoin to send. This would be a good practice project for you to try on your own. You would have to get the current balance of bitcoin that the sender has, and do a check to validate that they have enough Bitcoin to send in the transaction.</p><p>Another way that this blockchain could be improved is by making it into a decentralized application platform similar to Etherium. You would do this simply by adding a functionality to the blockchain that would allow you to store more data inside of each block, <span>allowing you to store different types of data inside of each block, instead of just transactions. For example, you could store user data, administrative data, or any other type of data inside of each block. You would then use that data when you are generating the hash for each block, just like we use the transactions when we are generating the hashes</span>.</p><p>There are a lot of ways that you can customize and improve on the blockchain we've built; however, right now, we have a fully functioning prototype blockchain that can be hosted on a decentralized blockchain network.</p><p>So, that's it from us. We hope you enjoyed this book, learned a lot, and had fun building the blockchain that we created!</p></div>
