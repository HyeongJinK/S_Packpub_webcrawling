Every node was aware of all the other nodes in the network, which created a decentralized blockchain network. We now need to create a synchronized network, so that the blockchain on every node is the same and data is consistent throughout. We can't afford to have different versions of the blockchains running on different nodes, because this would totally destroy the purpose of having a blockchain. There should only be one version of the blockchain that is consistent across every node. Therefore, in this chapter, let's synchronize the network that we built in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating a Decentralized Blockchain Network</em></span>. We'll do this by broadcasting transactions and new blocks that have been mined across all the nodes in the network.</p><p>In this chapter, the following topics will be covered: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the need to synchronize the network</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building the <code class="literal">/transaction/broadcast</code> endpoint</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Refactoring the <code class="literal">createTransaction</code> method and the <code class="literal">/transaction</code> endpoint</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Testing the transaction endpoints</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Updating the mining information</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building the <code class="literal">/receive-new-block</code> endpoint</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Testing the new and updated <code class="literal">/mine</code> endpoints</li></ul></div><p>Let's get started with synchronizing the network.  </p><p> </p></div>
