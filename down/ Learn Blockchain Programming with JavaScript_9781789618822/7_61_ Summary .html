We started by defining the necessary endpoints for querying the required data. Then we built methods such as <code class="literal">getBlock</code>,<code class="literal">getTransaction</code>, and<code class="literal">getAddressData</code>to help the endpoints to query the data. Furthermore, we developed the <code class="literal">/block/:blockHash</code>, <code class="literal">/transaction/:transactionId</code>, and <code class="literal">/address/:address</code>endpoints. After doing this, we added the block explorer's frontend code to our blockchain directory and then tested the block explorer and all the endpoints that we developed. </p><p>With this chapter, we have reached the end of this book. By this point, we have built our very own blockchain and added all the necessary functionalities to it. In addition to this, we have also built our decentralized network and an interface to explore the blockchain. </p><p>The next chapter will be a quick summary of what we have learned throughout this book. We'll then explore what else we can do with the blockchain that we've developed.</p></div>
