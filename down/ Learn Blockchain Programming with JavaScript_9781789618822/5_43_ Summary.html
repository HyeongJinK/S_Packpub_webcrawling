You have created a decentralized blockchain network that's currently running across five nodes, and you built the functionality to synchronize the entire network, so that all the nodes have the exact same data. This mirrors how a blockchain would function in a real-world application.</p><p>In this chapter, we successfully synchronized the entire blockchain network by refactoring the endpoints to broadcast the data to all the nodes present in the network. We started by splitting the functionality of the <code class="literal">/createNewTransaction</code> method into two separate parts: the <code class="literal">/createNewTransaction</code> method and the <code class="literal">addTransactionToPendingTransactions</code> method. Then, we built the <code class="literal">/transaction/broadcast</code> endpoint to broadcast the newly created transaction to all the nodes in the network. We also refactored the <code class="literal">/transaction</code> endpoint, so that the <code class="literal">/transaction/broadcast</code> endpoint and the <code class="literal">/transaction</code> endpoint could work together. Later on in the chapter, we refactored the <code class="literal">/mine</code> endpoint and also built a new endpoint,<code class="literal">/receive-new-block</code>. With the help of these endpoints, the newly created blocks can be broadcast to all the nodes in the network.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll be building consensus algorithms to make sure that all of the nodes inside our network can agree on the correct data to hold inside the blockchain.</p></div>
