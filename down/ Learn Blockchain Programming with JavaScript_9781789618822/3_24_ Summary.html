Then we installed Postman and understood how to use it to test our endpoints. After this, we moved on to build various endpoints of our server and tested those to verify whether or not they were working properly.   </p><p>In the next chapter, we will be creating a network of nodes or a decentralized network to host our blockchain, just like the ones that are hosted in the real world.</p></div>
