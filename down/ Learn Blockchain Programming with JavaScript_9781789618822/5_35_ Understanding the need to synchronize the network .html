We currently have a decentralized blockchain network that consists of five nodes. The data across these nodes is not consistent; data on each node might vary, which would lead to the failure of the purpose of having a blockchain. Let's try to understand this situation with the help of an example. Go to Postman and send a sample transaction, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/9fa23945-2734-45aa-8d1b-f109c396a97a.png" /></div><p>Send this transaction to the node that's hosted on <code class="literal">localhost:3001</code> by clicking on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Send</code></strong> button. This transaction will appear in the <code class="literal">pendingTransactions</code> array of <code class="literal">localhost:3001/blockchain</code>, which you can observe in the following screenshot: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/a3bc4ffe-97b5-4216-bae7-1e285a723391.png" /></div><p>Now, go to any of the other nodes and check for the transactions that were sent. We won't be able to view the transactions in the <code class="literal">pendingTransactions</code> array on those nodes. The sample transaction that is sent will only be present in the node on <code class="literal">localhost:3001</code>. It isn't broadcast to any other nodes in the network.  </p><p>What you are going to do in this chapter is to refactor the <code class="literal">/transaction</code> endpoint, so that whenever a transaction is created, it is broadcast to all nodes. This <span>means</span><a id="id325693477" class="indexterm"></a> that all nodes will have the same data. We need to do the same thing in order to mine a block. Let's refactor the <code class="literal">/mine</code> endpoint so that whenever a new block is mined, it is also broadcast throughout the entire network. This means that the entire network is synchronized and has the exact same number of blocks. Having data synchronized through the network is an important feature of blockchain technology. </p></div>
