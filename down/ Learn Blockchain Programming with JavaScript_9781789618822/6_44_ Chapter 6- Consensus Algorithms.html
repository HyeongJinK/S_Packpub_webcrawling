A consensus algorithm is a way for all of the nodes inside of the network to agree upon which data is correct and should be retained inside the blockchain. In order to build the consensus algorithm, we are first going to build a new method, called <code class="literal">chainIsValid</code>. This method will simply validate a blockchain by comparing all of the hashes of all of the blocks inside of the chain. After that, we are going to build a <code class="literal">/consensus</code> endpoint that we will hit whenever we want to use the consensus algorithm.</p><p>In this chapter, we're going to learn about the following: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What the consensus algorithm is</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building and testing the <code class="literal">chainIsValid</code> method</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building and testing the <code class="literal">/consesnsus</code> endpoint </li></ul></div><p>So, let's get started with the consensus algorithm.</p></div>
