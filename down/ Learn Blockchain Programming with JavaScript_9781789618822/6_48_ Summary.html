We started by building the <code class="literal">chainIsValid</code> method. In this method, we simply iterated through every single block inside of the blockchain, and compared hashes on every block to make sure that they are correct. Then we moved on to test the method. In addition to this, we built the <code class="literal">/consensus</code> endpoint with the help of the <code class="literal">chainIsValid</code> method.   </p><p>In the next chapter, we're going to build a block explorer that we'll be able to access on the browser. This block explorer will allow us to interact with the blockchain through a user interface.</p></div>
