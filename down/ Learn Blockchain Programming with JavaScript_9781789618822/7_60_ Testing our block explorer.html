<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch07lvl1sec61"></a>Testing our block explorer</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>In this section, we're going to test the <span>block</span><a id="id325442705" class="indexterm"></a> explorer to make sure that it works correctly, and also to make sure that all endpoints and methods that we created in the previous chapter also work correctly. If the block explorer works, then we already know that the entire blockchain is also working correctly and is running on the decentralized blockchain network, so everything is wrapping up nicely now as we enter the final section of this chapter. Consequently, this is the last test that we will be doing. Let's follow these steps now to test the block explorer: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>In order to test the block explorer, we should ensure that we have all five of the nodes running.</li><li>Next, head over to the browser and open up the block explorer by going to <code class="literal">localhost:3003/block-explorer</code>. You can actually go to a block explorer that's hosted on any of the nodes in the network, because the blockchain is hosted across the entire network.</li><li>Now, in order to test the block explorer, we need to add some data to the blockchain. To add data to the blockchain, we're just going to create a lot of transactions and create some new blocks similar to what we did in the previous sections. You can refer back to the previous chapters for a quick review on how to add transactions and blocks to the blockchain.</li><li>After adding the data, we can now test the block explorer. Let's first get a block by searching for its block hash. Let's select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Block Hash</code></strong>option:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/347c80a0-c909-4046-adbb-428f5a0964d4.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="5" type="1"><li>Then, from the blockchain, copy the hash value from any of the blocks and paste it into the block explorer:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/9b8eff7f-0c6c-46b6-a973-571dfa8b12ec.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="6" type="1"><li>Now, click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Search</code></strong> button. You should see a <span>similar</span><a id="id325690275" class="indexterm"></a> output as in the following screenshot: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/cd4189c1-7e3a-47cc-bb32-b2b3160f8067.png" /></div><p>This is basically how the block explorer works. We enter a hash or a piece of data that we're looking for, and in return, we get that piece of data as output. From the preceding screenshot, we can observe that we had the block returned with an index of <code class="literal">4</code> for the hash value that we input to the block explorer. We also got all of the details related to that block. Furthermore, as you can probably tell for this search, we're hitting the<code class="literal">/block/:blockHash</code>endpoint. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="7" type="1"><li>Next, search for a transaction by inputting the <code class="literal">transactionId</code>. Go to block explorer and select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Transaction ID</code></strong> option. Then, go to the blockchain and copy a <code class="literal">transactionId</code> value from any block and input it to the block explorer: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/af479d2c-c20f-4f5d-883b-78d93e0075fe.png" /></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="8" type="1"><li>Then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Search</code></strong> button. You'll see a similar output to the following: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/c6a21c7b-15bb-4aab-b88f-8bb8c2a5efea.png" /></div><p>From the preceding screenshot, we can see that we got all of the transaction details related to the <code class="literal">transactionId</code> that we input to the block explorer. We also got to observe the balance amount of <strong class="userinput"><code>400</code></strong> bitcoins for that particular <code class="literal">transactionId</code>. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="9" type="1"><li>Finally, test the <span>address</span><a id="id325698344" class="indexterm"></a> endpoint. To do this, select the <strong class="userinput"><code>Address</code></strong> option from the block explorer and then input either the sender's or recipient's address from any of the blocks. Then click on the <strong class="userinput"><code>Search</code></strong> button. You should see the following output on the screen: </li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/809faf5d-a974-45ea-a570-6cd0a415b5e3.png" /></div><p>From the preceding screenshot, we can see that the address has a balance of <strong class="userinput"><code>749.35</code></strong> Bitcoins and we can see all of the transactions that are associated with the address that we've input. </p><p> </p><p>Now, for any of these searches, if we <span>input</span><a id="id325704640" class="indexterm"></a> a piece of data that doesn't exist, we'll get the result back as follows:  </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789618822/graphics/11dc43af-b0d9-4931-b449-3b88851f1063.png" /></div><p>This proves that the block explorer works just as it should.</p></div>
