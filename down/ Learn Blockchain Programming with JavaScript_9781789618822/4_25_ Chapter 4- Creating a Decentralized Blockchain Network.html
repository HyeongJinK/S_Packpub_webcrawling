The way that our blockchain works right now is that we have a single blockchain, and the only way to access it is through the API: our single server. This server is very centralized, which is not beneficial because the API is in total control of the blockchain and the data that gets added to it.</p><p>In the real world, all blockchain technology is hosted across a decentralized network. In this chapter, that's what we're going to focus on building. We'll build a decentralized blockchain network by creating various instances of the API. Each of these instances of the API are going to be a network node in our blockchain network. All of these nodes will work together to host our blockchain.</p><p>In this way, it's not just a single network node that has total control over our blockchain. Instead, our blockchain is hosted across the entire decentralized network. This way, if there's one bad player in our network, or somebody who is trying to cheat the system, we can refer to the other network nodes to see what the real data should be inside of our blockchain and what our blockchain should actually look like.</p><p>Having our blockchain hosted across a decentralized network is very powerful because it vastly increases the security of our blockchain, and therefore we don't have to just trust one single entity with all of our data.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Learning how to create and test multiple nodes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding the <code class="literal">currentNodeUrl</code> to our network</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding new endpoints for the decentralized network</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building the <code class="literal">/register-and-broadcast-node</code> endpoint</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Building and testing the <code class="literal">/register-nod</code>e endpoint
