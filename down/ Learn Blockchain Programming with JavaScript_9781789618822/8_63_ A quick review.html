If you think about how much you have accomplished throughout the entirety of this book, it's pretty impressive.</p><p>We started with nothing, and from there, we built a blockchain data structure, followed by an API to interact with it. We then turned our API into a decentralized blockchain network, and synchronized the data across the entire network running on multiple different nodes.</p><p>We then created a <span class="strong"><strong>consensus</strong></span> algorithm to make sure that the data on all of our nodes was synchronized and legitimate. Finally, we built a block explorer to explore our blockchain through a user interface. Throughout this entire book, we have built a lot of functionalities, as well as an awesome blockchain prototype. </p><p>One important thing that you must be aware of is that, throughout this book, we have been running all five of our nodes on one computer.</p><p>However, if you were to download this entire project onto multiple different computers, you would be able to run each node on a separate computer to really simulate how a decentralized blockchain network works.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You would just have to make sure that every computer running your project is on the same network. Instead of having a localhost address, you would just have the IP address that each node is running on.</p><p>Try experimenting with this idea. It's pretty cool to see your blockchain network running across multiple different computers.</p></div>
