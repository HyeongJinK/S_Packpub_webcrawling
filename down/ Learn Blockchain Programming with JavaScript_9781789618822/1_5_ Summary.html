Then we moved onto setting up our project to create our very own blockchain. We also had a quick overview of all of the topics you'll get to learn about in this book. </p><p>In the next chapter, we'll build our blockchain by learning about the constructor function, prototype object, block method, transaction method, and many more important concepts. </p></div>
