Let's explore some of the uses of sensor data, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Heath sensor data</strong></span>: A lot of medical <span>institutions</span><a id="id325806795" class="indexterm"></a> record patient vital signs in real time. These vital signs include heart rate, electrodermal activities, brainwaves, temperature, and more. This real-time sensor data, when collected, is massive, and can be considered big data. This data can be used by ICT technology to diagnose patients. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Weather data</strong></span>: The real-time streaming of weather data is done by many satellites, in order to collect the vital signs for the weather. This data is used in weather prediction.

This data can be streamed in real time, making it available to some servers. </li></ul></div></div>
