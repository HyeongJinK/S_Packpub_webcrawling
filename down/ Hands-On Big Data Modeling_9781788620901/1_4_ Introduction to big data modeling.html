Say we have the dataset, which we classify as big data, and before doing any analysis on the dataset, we need to have an idea of how the data looks. The goal of data modeling is to formally explore the nature of data so that you can figure out what kind of storage you need, and what kind of processing you can do on it.</p><p>Data modeling is a technique that helps to give <span>meaningful</span><a id="id325813652" class="indexterm"></a> insight into data by defining and categorizing it, and establishing official definitions and descriptors so that the data can be utilized by all information systems in a company.</p><p>We can hold at least two <span>primary</span> reasons for performing data modeling:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Strategic data modeling facilitates the overall information systems development strategy</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Data modeling can help in the development of new databases</li></ul></div><p>The data modeling for strategic outlining suggests defining what kind of data you will need for your company processes, while modeling in the context of analysis is more focused on representing data that exists and finding ways to classify it. In the case of big data, that process probably requires finding similarities between data from disparate sources and confirming that they, in fact, describe the same thing. In either case, the end goal is to generate a representation of your data that can be replicated in your database architecture.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec7"></a>Uses of models</h3></div></div></div><p>In this section, we are going to discuss why we need data models, and the main benefits we can get by studying current data models. A high-level data model illustrates the core concepts and principles of any company in a very simplistic way, employing short descriptions. One of the biggest advantages of developing the high-level model is that it <span>helps us to arrive at common terminology and definitions of the ideas and principles</span>.</p><p>A high-level data model utilizes simplistic <span>graphical</span><a id="id325811463" class="indexterm"></a> images to illustrate the core concepts and principles of an organization and what they mean. A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine how data can be stored and accessed. </p><p>Let's consider a simple student score-recording system. A student has a <span class="strong"><strong>First name</strong></span>, a <span class="strong"><strong>Last name</strong></span>, and a unique identifier. Each student is associated with an institution. Each student has a <span class="strong"><strong>Start date</strong></span> and other data associated with them. We can better represent this using some kind of model than in a paragraph, which is difficult to understand.</p><p> </p><p>Let's convert it into a model:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/b560e9ea-4944-4a13-8210-125d1eb0f263.png" /></div><p>Model 1.1</p><p></p><p>Now, let's consider the preceding model. It shows clearly the correlation between students and the <span class="strong"><strong>Institution</strong></span> provider and how they are saved in multiple tables. It's easier to understand than a paragraph. Now let's analyze this model and see what benefits we get from the model compared with <span>other</span><a id="id325808137" class="indexterm"></a> textual representations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Gaining insight</strong></span>: A detailed model shows the process from various angles. Like in the preceding model, we can see how students are associated with the provider institutions, the different types of plans, and when a course starts. In order to start with data modeling, it is important to know the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding how the business works in order to understand data flow inside the organization. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding what type of data is gathered and stored in the organization.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding business processes and relationships.

In addition to this, the model can be used as a training aid.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Verification</strong></span>: The process models are analyzed to find errors in systems or procedures. If your requirements gathering were complete and included the merging of data from multiple sources, as well as query and reporting obligations, you'd have business intelligence opportunities that were nonexistent when your data existed in silos, or in haphazardly-designed databases.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Performance analysis</strong></span>: A detailed model made from the data can be used to analyze the performance of the system by employing several available techniques, such as simulations, and <span>dry and run playing</span> in the model.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Specification</strong></span>: A relevant model generated from an organization's data can be utilized to create a <span class="strong"><strong>Software Requirement Specification</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SRS</strong></span>) document <span>that</span><a id="id325792010" class="indexterm"></a> can be used as a roadmap between a developer and end user stakeholders. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Configuration</strong></span>: The models constructed from data can be applied to configure a system. A detailed model constructed with precision shows the relationship between modules and how a module can communicate with another module. This information can be used by any organization to enforce interoperability among the modules and module configuration parameters, and reduce redundancies.</li></ul></div></div></div>
