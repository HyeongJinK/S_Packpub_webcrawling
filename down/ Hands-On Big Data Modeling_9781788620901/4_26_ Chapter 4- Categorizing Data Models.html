Data flow is a complex process in a software system. Modeling is an important part of understanding a complex software system's diagram and knowing how the data flow in the software system is represented using text and symbols. This process is <span>usually</span><a id="id326343430" class="indexterm"></a> called <span class="strong"><strong>data modeling</strong></span>. The diagrams that are generated by data modeling can become a blueprint for new software development, or for legacy software re-engineering. Data and storage models are basic components in any big data ecosystem. </p><p>Storage models include the physical aspect of data storage, while data models store the logical representations and structures for data processing and management. So, comprehending data storage and <span>storage</span><a id="id326553444" class="indexterm"></a> models plays a vital role in getting familiar with big data ecosystems. In this chapter, we will explore various aspects of big data modeling, as well as storage models.</p><p>The main topics that we will cover in this chapter are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span>Exploring</span> the different levels of data modeling</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Discovering the various types of data model</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Discussing the relational data model of <span class="strong"><strong>comma-separated value</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSV</strong></span>) files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the array data model of an image</li></ul></div></div>
