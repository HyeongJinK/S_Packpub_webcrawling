In this chapter, we learned about structured data and different types of modeling that can be performed on them. In addition to that, we got familiar with some of the important Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and IPython. We used these libraries to generate models for house attributes, and used these models to predict the price of a new house based on certain parameters. </p><p>In the next chapter, we will be looking at unstructured data and its sources, and using some of the most popular open source tools to generate models from them.</p></div>
