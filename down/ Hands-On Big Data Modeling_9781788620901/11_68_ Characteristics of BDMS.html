As a side note, since big data has too much data and too many updates done concurrently, maintenance of ACID properties leads to a significant slowdown of the system. In an ideal BDMS, it would have <span class="strong"><strong>BASE</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Basic Availability</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Soft State</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong></span>) properties. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Basic Availability</strong></span> refers to the fact that the system guarantees the availability of data when requested, and the data remains consistent in case of failure. The <span class="strong"><strong>soft state</strong></span> of a system states that the system is consistent in case of all the states, like state without input, or the state with incorrect input sets. <span class="strong"><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong></span> states that the system is consistent eventually, so a user is likely to get Twitter feeds once they are logged into their account but might not see them right away.</p></div></div>
