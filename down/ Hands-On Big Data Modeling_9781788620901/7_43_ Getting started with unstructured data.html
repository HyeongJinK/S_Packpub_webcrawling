A lot of researchers, data analysts, data modelers, and data scientists are struggling to find novel methods to enhance precision in unstructured data analysis. There are different sources of unstructured data. The most <span>common</span><a id="id326483408" class="indexterm"></a> sources include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Email correspondence, and the reply, response, forward threads</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Social media posts and activities</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Video, sound, or image files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Web-browsing behavior</li></ul></div><p>According to IBM, 90% of the world's data was produced in the past 2 years, which is unstructured or semi-structured. Due to its very nature, unstructured data is tremendously difficult to analyze. In the past, analysts were not able to do much about it due to the lack of technology. But with the upsurge of ICT technology, big data analysis, data mining, and machine learning approaches, it possible to create models that can classify and analyze these datasets.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec56"></a>Tools for intelligent analysis</h3></div></div></div><p>The best method of analyzing the unstructured data is to look for patterns. Patterns reveal whether there are any similarities in the data or any processes are involved in it. Various mining tools make use of data-mining techniques, statistical analysis, <span class="strong"><strong>model-driven software engineering</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MDSE</strong></span>) techniques, and artificial <span>intelligence</span><a id="id325337730" class="indexterm"></a> techniques to analyze <span>unstructured</span><a id="id325591964" class="indexterm"></a> data. Here are some of the most popular techniques:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Machine learning</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NLP</strong></span>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cognitive computing</li></ul></div><p>These advancements will automate the process of curating and maintaining the data. Analysts are open to focus more on analysis, prediction rather than preprocessing, and data transformation. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec57"></a>New methods of data processing</h3></div></div></div><p>Big data processing demands massive <span>computational</span><a id="id325591996" class="indexterm"></a> power. In many cases, it expects more power than one machine can handle. This problem has caused engineers to look for new strategies for handling tremendous amounts of data. The advent of cloud computing is making it possible to handle large datasets by applying several networked devices to create vast computing grids.</p><p>Unlike conventional parallel processing, this <span class="emphasis"><em>device mesh</em></span> can share and examine information across several endpoints. Consensus algorithms are then used to optimize the outcomes. The model learns by using past data with the expectation that the device mesh will work better on future data. This method could be employed to develop a smart spam filter, an automated chatbot system, or a bank fraud alert system, for example.</p></div></div>
