In this chapter, we are going to discuss what type of modeling can be done using unstructured datasets. Unstructured data refers to data that doesn't fit neatly into the traditional row-and-column structure of relational databases. There are unstructured datasets all around us. In fact, most of the data that we find on the web is unstructured. And performing data analysis and data modeling on these unstructured datasets is becoming a challenging yet very favorable research topic.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">We will see real-life examples of unstructured data found in day-to-day business at the enterprise level, and how modeling can be applied to this data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Users will get to get their hands dirty using the R programming language and the KNIME open source tool</li></ul></div></div>
