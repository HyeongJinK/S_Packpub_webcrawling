<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch11lvl1sec68"></a>Aerospike</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Aerospike is <span>one</span><a id="id325804908" class="indexterm"></a> of several NoSQL databases architectures that has been developed for high-speed performance, scalability, and reliability. Like Redis, this is also a key-value pair architecture, and is optimized for flash storage. The Aerospike database is written in C and has three layers: the data layer, a self-managed distribution layer, and a cluster-aware client layer. The distribution layer is replicated across the datacenters to enforce consistency. </p><p>Some of the important features of <span>Aerospike</span><a id="id325804941" class="indexterm"></a> are summarized as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Use of hybrid memory</strong></span>: Aerospike utilizes flash storage in parallel on one machine to perform reads at sub-millisecond latencies at a very high throughput in the presence of a heavy write load. The use of an SSD drive or flash drive enforces high vertical scale-up. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Aerospike has a great ability for planning and scaling up for <span class="strong"><strong>cluster management</strong></span>, as it has a uniform distribution of data and integrated metadata indexers. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Real-time engine</strong></span>: Aerospike integrates a real-time engine that gives the maximum performance possible and can scale up to several million transactions per second. 
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Smart client</strong></span>: The smart client layer in <span>Aerospike</span><a id="id325803721" class="indexterm"></a> is utilized to track the cluster configuration in the database and manage communications in the server node. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Aerospike has been fully optimized to be used for global enterprises. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Flexible data model</strong></span>: It has a structured yet schema-less flexible data model that supports typed data for cross-language compatibility. </li></ul></div><p>The Aerospike technical details start with the expected shared-nothing architecture and are log-structured. It has more logical data partitions than physical ones. In addition to that, it has synchronous replication within a datacenter. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec80"></a>Aerospike technology</h3></div></div></div><p>Aerospike <span>contains</span><a id="id325791952" class="indexterm"></a> four main components: <span class="strong"><strong>CLIENT</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>CLUSTER</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>SERVER</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>STORAGE</strong></span>. This is illustrated by the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/12873d65-0f97-424b-8848-68c93fcab558.png" /></div><p>Figure 11.3: Aerospike database technology architecture</p><p></p><p>The preceding figure is <span>taken</span><a id="id325591976" class="indexterm"></a> from A<span>erospike's official website (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.aerospike.com/technology/" target="_blank">https://www.aerospike.com/technology/</a>), </span>which shows four distinct components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Client</strong></span>: This tier is <span>responsible</span><a id="id325337702" class="indexterm"></a> for facilitating a native-language interface to each language for easier programming with high performance. It includes open source client libraries that implement Aerospike APIs and track nodes, and it is aware of which data is present in the cluster. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cluster</strong></span>: There is a <span>clustering</span><a id="id325337716" class="indexterm"></a> layer that allows immediate and eventual consistency management in transactions. This layer ensures the data is evenly and randomly distributed across all the nodes. This layer controls clusters' communication and automates fail-over, replication, cross-datacenter synchronization, and data migrations. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Server</strong></span>: The server <span>interacts</span><a id="id325337730" class="indexterm"></a> with the storage layer for persistence. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Storage</strong></span>: The storage layer uses <span>three</span><a id="id325806822" class="indexterm"></a> kinds of storage systems in memory with a dynamic RAM or DRAM, a regular spinning disk, and a flash/SSD that loads the data when required. </li></ul></div></div></div>
