We will try to use the model thus extracted to predict the price of Bitcoin. In addition to this, we will learn how to use iPython and play with Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy. We will be exploring the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Bitcoin data and its parameters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding different types of regression models and other algorithms</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exploring the use of a regression model to predict the future price of Bitcoin</li></ul></div></div>
