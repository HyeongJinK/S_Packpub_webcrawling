Advancement in parallel and distributed databases has been positively affected by the development of parallel and distributed computing.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec74"></a>Parallel DBMS</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>parallel database system</strong></span> seeks to <span>enhance</span><a id="id325804890" class="indexterm"></a> performance through the parallelization of varied operations, such as how loading data, building indexes, and evaluating queries though data could also be held on during a distributed fashion, and the distribution is ruled exclusively by performance considerations. Parallel databases improve processing and input/output speeds by victimizing multiple CPUs and disks in parallel. Centralized and client-server database systems don't seem to be powerful enough to handle such applications. In data processing, several operations square measures performed at the same time, as critical serial processing, in which the computational steps are performed consecutively.</p><p> </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec44"></a>Motivations for parallel DBMS</h4></div></div></div><p>Advancement in the use of parallel <span>machines</span><a id="id325792006" class="indexterm"></a> is becoming quite common and affordable. In addition to this, databases are growing larger because of the volume of transactional data that is collected, stored. The purpose of this storage is to utilize them of business.</p><p>Using parallel DBMS has been shown to improve response time. It is possible to process a number of transactions in parallel with each other. This improves the overall throughput.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec45"></a>Architectures for parallel databases</h4></div></div></div><p>There are several <span>architectures</span><a id="id325791949" class="indexterm"></a> proposed for building parallel DBMSs. Three main architectures include shared memory, shared disk, and shared nothing. As the name suggests, in the shared memory architecture, a global memory is shared. The shared-memory architecture is said to be closer to a conventional machine and easy to program, and the overhead is low. On the other hand, it leads to a bottleneck problem and might be a bit expensive to build.</p><p>The shared-disk architecture shares a global disk. It has similar benefits to the shared-memory architecture. In the shared-nothing architecture, each node has its own memory as well as storage, and nothing is shared between the nodes.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec75"></a>Distributed DBMS</h3></div></div></div><p>In a distributed database, data is stored across several sites managed by a DBMS capable of running independently. A <span class="strong"><strong>distributed database</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DDB</strong></span>) is a <span>collection</span><a id="id325591970" class="indexterm"></a> of multiple, logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network. A distributed DBMS is then described as the software system that allows the management of the databases that are geographically located at different places and creates the distribution transparency to the users [3].</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 10.1</em></span> explains the basic concept of a centralized DBMS and a distributed DBMS. As illustrated in the figure, in the centralized DBMS, a central data storage resides in the center, and all the terminal uses a network to communicate with the central storage. In a distributed DBMS, the storage facility is distributed at multiple sites:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/6cd8ea23-2b93-4a4a-837c-bc2077695e0b.png" /></div><p><span>Figure 10.1</span>: Centralized DBMS versus distributed DBMS</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec46"></a>Features of a distributed DBMS</h4></div></div></div><p>A <span>distributed</span><a id="id325337713" class="indexterm"></a> DBMS has the following distinguishable features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">It is a collection of logically-related shared data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The data in the distributed DBMS is split into a number of fragments</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Fragments may be replicated in a distributed system
