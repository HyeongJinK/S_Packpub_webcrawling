We examined different data model structures and data operations performed on the model. Various operations can be performed on the data model, but with each model comes a set of constraints. Finally, we learned about a unified approach to big data modeling and management.Â </p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to explore different categories of the data model and learn about the levels of data modeling. In addition, we will be exploring relation data models and other data models.</p></div>
