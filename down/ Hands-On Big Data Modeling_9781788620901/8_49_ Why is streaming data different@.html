One of the possible ways to generate insights from these datasets is by <span class="strong"><strong>batch processing</strong></span>. One of the classical approaches of <span>batch</span><a id="id325337716" class="indexterm"></a> processing is called <span class="strong"><strong>Hadoop's MapReduce paradigm</strong></span>.<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>The processing time can take anywhere <span>from</span><a id="id325337690" class="indexterm"></a> minutes to hours, or even more—it all depends on the size of the job. But if we are thinking about insights in real time, we are more concerned about streaming data. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Streaming data</strong></span> can be defined as a <span>sequence</span><a id="id325907505" class="indexterm"></a> of digitally-encoded coherent signals that are used to send or receive information that is in the process of being transmitted.</p><p>Formally, it can be defined as any ordered pair <span><span><span><span><span>(<span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span></span><span>, </span><span>Δ</span><span>) </span></span></span><span>(<span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, Δ),</span></span></span> where <span class="emphasis"><em>S </em></span>is a sequence of tuples and <span><span><span>Δ</span></span></span> is a sequence of positive real-time intervals.</p><p>In order to humanize the definition, let's consider the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/5952b12b-efae-42d4-a5c3-1b4d7ff122ee.jpeg" /></div><p>Figure 7.3: Conveyor belt</p><p>To understand this definition, we can think of data streaming as a <span>conveyor</span><a id="id325977845" class="indexterm"></a> belt, as demonstrated in the preceding diagram. We can assume the items on the belt are data packets that are being transmitted. If we have a sorting machine at the end of the belt that accepts or rejects items based on certain conditions, we can take this as a real-time streaming analytics scenario. If we replace the color camera with machine learning algorithms, it would show what a real-time streaming-analytics scenario would look like in a big dataset. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec62"></a>Use cases of stream processing</h3></div></div></div><p>Streaming is used in many <span>different</span><a id="id325977812" class="indexterm"></a> scenarios. Most of these use cases deal with the detection of problems, and we have a reasonable response to improve the outcome. The following are some of the use cases where stream processing has been successfully utilized:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Financial stock price movement and prediction</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Solar power service management in real time</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Production line monitoring </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Video conferencing and chatting</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Audio signal streaming</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Music streaming</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Virtual reality data streaming</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Supply chain optimizations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Fraud and intrusion detection, surveillance, and their prevention</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Most smart device applications</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Traffic monitoring</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Context aware promotions, and advertising</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Computer system and network monitoring</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Geospatial data processing</li></ul></div><p>For example, <span class="strong"><strong>FlightStats</strong></span> is an application that processes about 60,000,000 weekly flight events that come into their data acquisition system and then turns them into real-time intelligence for airlines and millions of travelers around the world.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec63"></a>What is a data stream?</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>stream</strong></span> is defined as a possibly-unbounded sequence of <span>data</span><a id="id325813598" class="indexterm"></a> items or records that may or may not be related to, or correlated with, each other. Each data stream is generally <span class="strong"><strong>timestamped</strong></span>, and in some cases <span class="strong"><strong>geo-tagged</strong></span>. Streaming data sometimes get referred to as event data, as each data item is treated as an individual event in a synchronized sequence.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec64"></a>Data streaming systems</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Data streaming systems</strong></span> are a <span>computerized</span><a id="id325813645" class="indexterm"></a> system that is built with the purpose of managing and processing the data in motion. The sheer size, variety, and velocity of big data add further challenges to these systems. Such systems are designed to manage relatively simple computations, such as one record at a time or a set of objects in a short time window of the most recent data:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/897a720d-5a53-4050-b4de-7a85500685e9.png" /></div><p>Figure 7.4: Illustration of data streaming system </p><p>In a data-steaming system, the computations are done in near real-time, sometimes in memory, and as independent computations. The processing components often subscribe to a system, or a stream source, non-interactively. This means they send nothing back to the source and nor do they establish interactions with the source. The concept of dynamic steering involves dynamically changing the next steps or direction of an application through a <span>continuous</span><a id="id325815952" class="indexterm"></a> computational process using streaming. <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic steering</strong></span> is often a part of data streaming management and processing. A self-driving car is a perfect example of a <span>dynamic</span><a id="id325815962" class="indexterm"></a> steering application, but all data streaming applications fall into this category, such as the online gaming. Amazon Kinesis and other open source Apache projects, such as Storm, Flink, Spark Streaming, and Samza, are examples of big data streaming systems. Many other companies also provide streaming systems for big data, which are frequently updated in response to the rapidly changing nature of these technologies. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec65"></a>How streaming works</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a few ways to achieve this process, and each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. The first approach is called <span class="strong"><strong>native stream processing</strong></span>.<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>In the native streaming process, the events are <span>processed</span><a id="id325878483" class="indexterm"></a> as they come into the existence, one after another. This results in a very low latency. If an event is successively large, it blocks other events from being processed. In addition to that, this technique is computationally very expensive. </p><p>Another approach is called <span class="strong"><strong>Micro-batch processing</strong></span>.<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>This <span>technique</span><a id="id325878505" class="indexterm"></a> makes the <span>opposite</span><a id="id325878512" class="indexterm"></a> trade-off. It breaks the incoming events up into several batches either by arrival time or until a batch has reached a threshold size. Splitting reduces the computational cost of processing. However, the process introduces higher latency. Whether it is native-stream processing or micro-batch processing, they involve discrete steps of data ingestion, data processing, and data analytics as listed as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Data ingestion or data harvesting</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Data processing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Data analytics or deriving value</li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec33"></a>Data harvesting</h4></div></div></div><p>Data harvesting, or data ingestion, is the process of <span>consuming</span><a id="id325878536" class="indexterm"></a> data that originated from a source. There are different methods applied in order to consume the data. For example, a lot of sensor devices are used in the healthcare domain, such as a smartwatch, Empathica E4 watch, and virtual reality headsets such as Oculus Go. These sensors are produced at frequent intervals. The interval data is sampled and then sent to the required server for further preprocessing or analysis. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec34"></a>Data processing</h4></div></div></div><p>The stored or processed data needs to be processed. Various <span>open</span><a id="id325907461" class="indexterm"></a> source and proprietary streaming platforms that can be used for this purpose. Two of the most popular open source options are Apache Storm and Apache Spark Streaming. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec35"></a>Data analytics</h4></div></div></div><p>This is the step where data-processing platforms are selected for <span>data</span><a id="id325907474" class="indexterm"></a> analysis.
