Big data <span>management</span><a id="id326336430" class="indexterm"></a> incorporates the policies, techniques, and processes used for data collection, storage, administration, and the delivery of large repositories. The step can involve cleaning, integration, migration, and reporting. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"></a>Data ingestion</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Data ingestion</strong></span> refers to the <span>process</span><a id="id326383758" class="indexterm"></a> of procuring data into the system. This can be done via manual, semi-automatic, or automatic methods. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note4"></a>Note</h3><p>Data ingestion means the process of getting the data into the data system that we are building or using.</p></div><p>In a smaller system, users prefer to have some kind of web form or visual interface that takes input in order to put the data into the system. However, when it comes to a larger system, such as a hospital management system, an airline management system, a government and public record management system, or a social media site, users often prefer to automate the data ingestion <span>process</span><a id="id326383777" class="indexterm"></a> as much as possible. So, when it comes to data ingestion, we need to explore a bunch of questions, such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How many data sources are there?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How many large data items are available?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Will the number of data sources grow over time?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">What is the rate at which data will be consumed?</li></ul></div><p>It is quite important to note that the size of an individual record is small, but the volume of data is quite enormous. When it comes to data ingestion, developers like to create a <span>bunch</span><a id="id325806677" class="indexterm"></a> of policies, called <span class="strong"><strong>ingestion policies</strong></span>, that guide the handling of errors during the data ingestion, as well as the data incompleteness, and so on. Data ingestion (along with its policies) is an integral part of a big data system.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"></a>Data storage</h3></div></div></div><p>The primary goal of a storage infrastructure is to <span>store</span><a id="id325806787" class="indexterm"></a> data. There are two <span>issues</span><a id="id325806795" class="indexterm"></a> that needed to be considered when dealing with data storage, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Capacity</strong></span>: The capacity refers to how much storage one should allocate (or what size the memory should be) in order to store data.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scalability</strong></span>: The attached storage devices should be scalable, as the volume of data will grow over time. Also, scalability deals with the ability to connect to the network in order to get extra storage over time. </li></ul></div><p>In a big data system, we have the choice of architecting a storage infrastructure by choosing how much of each type of storage we need to have. Using SSDs for storing a large amount of data speeds up lookup operations in the data by at least a factor of ten over hard drives; however, it also increases the cost.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"></a>Data quality</h3></div></div></div><p>It is important that the <span>stored</span><a id="id325806827" class="indexterm"></a> data is useful, error-free, and <span>meant</span><a id="id325808133" class="indexterm"></a> for its intended purpose. High-quality data gives actionable insights, whereas poor-quality data leads to poor analysis, and hence, to poor decisions. Errors in the data in these industries can break regulations, leading to legal complications. The <span>following</span><a id="id325808141" class="indexterm"></a> factors can help to evaluate data quality:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Completeness</strong></span>: Are there values missing in the data set?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Validity</strong></span>: The data matches the rule set. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Uniqueness</strong></span>: The data has minimal redundancies. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Consistency</strong></span>: The data is consistent across various data stores. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Timeliness</strong></span>: The data represents reality from a required point in time. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Accuracy</strong></span>: The degree to which the result of a particular measurement, calculation, or specification conforms to the correct value.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"></a>Data operations</h3></div></div></div><p>A very significant aspect of data <span>management</span><a id="id325813595" class="indexterm"></a> is documenting, defining, implementing, and testing the set of operations that is required for a specific application. In short, there are two <span>distinct</span><a id="id325813604" class="indexterm"></a> sets of operations that are used for data management, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>An operation that works on a singular object</strong></span>: As an example, an operation that crops an image, extracting a sub-area from an area of pixels, is a single-object operation, because we consider the image to be a single object.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>An operation that works on collections of data objects</strong></span>: This operation deals with merging two collections together, in order to form a larger collection. </li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"></a>Data scalability and security</h3></div></div></div><p>Today, most big data <span>management</span><a id="id325813654" class="indexterm"></a> systems are designed to <span>operate</span><a id="id325815950" class="indexterm"></a> over a cluster of machines, and have the ability to adjust when more machines are added or when machines fail. <span class="strong"><strong>Cluster management</strong></span> (the management of <span>data</span><a id="id325815964" class="indexterm"></a> operations over a cluster) is an important <span>component</span><a id="id325815971" class="indexterm"></a> in today's big <span>data</span><a id="id325816007" class="indexterm"></a> management systems.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note5"></a>Note</h3><p><span><span>Security is a measure of the system’s ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized. An action taken against a computer system with the intention of doing harm is called an attack and can take a number of forms. It may be an unauthorized attempt to access data or services or to modify data, or it may be intended to deny services to legitimate users.</span></span></p></div><p><span><span>Scalability involves the impact of adding or removing resources, and the measures will reflect the associated availability and the loan assigned to existing and new resources</span></span>. While there are many security products available, ensuring security and achieving data processing efficiency at the same time remains a research issue in the field of big data management.</p></div></div>
