In theory, data points that are clustered in the same group should have similar properties or features, while data points in different groups should have highly distinct properties or features. Clustering is a common technique for statistical data analysis, and is used in many fields.</p><p>There are different types of clustering algorithm.

For example, the same crew might shoot movies that have similar average ratings. So we want to use clustering to determine what can lead to different clusters in IMDb datasets. In other words, we want to see what is the most important factor affecting clustering in the IMDb dataset.</p></div>
