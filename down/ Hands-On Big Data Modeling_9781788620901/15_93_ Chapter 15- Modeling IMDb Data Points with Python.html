Now, it's time to apply this knowledge to some real databases. This chapter consumes IMDb data points as big data and uses it in Python to model according to tips and tricks learned in this book. This book tries to consume the data in raw format, transform it into the correct format, model it using <span>Python</span>, and interpret the model thus produced. We will be covering the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Discovering the nature of IMDb data </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Modeling weather data with Python</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Interpreting the data model discovered</li></ul></div></div>
