With the high prevalence of big data from existing hardware and software, enterprises are still struggling to process, store, analyze, and manage big data using traditional data-mining tools and techniques. In this section, we are going to explore the sources of these complex and dynamic data and how can we consume them. </p><p> </p><p>We can separate the sources of the data into three major categories. The following diagram shows the <span>three</span><a id="id325806679" class="indexterm"></a> major sources of big data:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/2f69a3f7-8e49-4f22-abef-fe3f1c1a3988.jpg" /></div><p></p><p>Let's look into the three major sources one by one:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span><span class="strong"><strong>Logs generated by a machine</strong></span>:</span> A lot of the <span>big</span><a id="id325804937" class="indexterm"></a> data is generated from real-time sensors in industrial machinery or vehicles that create logs for tracking user behaviors, environmental sensors, or personal health-trackers and other sensor data. Most of this machine-created data can be grouped into the following subcategories:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Click-log stream data</strong></span>: This is the data that is captured every time a user clicks any link on a website. A detailed analysis of this data can reveal information related to customer behavior and deep interactions of the users with the current website, as well as customers' buying patterns.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Gaming events log data</strong></span>: A user performs a set of tasks when playing any online game. Each and every move the online user makes in a game can be stored. This data can be analyzed and the results can be helpful in knowing how end users are propeled through a gaming portfolio.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sensors log data</strong></span>:<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>Various types of sensors log data involve radio-frequency ID tags, smart meters, smartwatch sensor data, medical sensor devices such as heart-rate-monitoring sensors, and <span class="strong"><strong>Global Positioning System</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPS</strong></span>) data. These types of <span>sensors</span><a id="id325803735" class="indexterm"></a> log data can be recorded and then used to analyze the actual status of the subject.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Weblog event data</strong></span>:<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>There is <span>extensive</span> use of servers, cloud infrastructures, applications, networks, and so on. These applications operate and record all kinds of data about their events and operation. These data, when stored, can amount to massive volumes of data, and can be useful in understanding how to deal with service-level agreements or to predict security breaches.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Point-of-sale event-log data</strong></span>: Almost every product these days has a unique barcode. A cashier in a retail shop or department swipes the barcode of any product when selling, and all the data associated with the product is generated and can be captured. This data can be analyzed to understand the selling pattern of a retailer.
</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Person</strong></span>: People generate a lot of big data <span>from</span><a id="id325337712" class="indexterm"></a> social media, status updates, tweets, photos, and media uploads. Most of these logs are generated through interactions of a user with a network, such as the internet. This data reveal contains how a user communicates with the network. These interaction logs can reveal deep content-interaction models that can be useful in understanding user behavior. This analysis can be used to train a model to present personalized recommendations of web items, including next news to read, or, most likely, products to consider buying. A lot of similar researches are very hot in today's industry, including  sentiment analysis and topic analysis. Most of this data is unstructured, as there is no proper format or well-defined structure available. Most of this data is either in a text format, a portable document format, a <span class="strong"><strong>comma-separated value</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSV</strong></span>), or a JSON file. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Organization</strong></span>: We get a massive amount of data from an organization in terms of transaction information in databases and structured data open-stored in the data warehouse. This data is a highly structured form of data. Organizations store their data on some type of RDBMS, such as SQL, Oracle, and MS <span>Access</span>. This data resides in a fixed format inside the field or a table. This organization-generated data is consumed and processed in ICT technology to comprehend business intelligence and market analysis.</li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec6"></a>Challenges of big data</h3></div></div></div><p>There are certain key aspects that make the big <span>data</span><a id="id325591974" class="indexterm"></a> very challenging. In this section, we'll discuss some of them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Heterogeneity</strong></span>:<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>There is a great deal of diversity in the information consumed by human beings, and t<span>hey are indeed tolerated as wel</span>l. In fact, the nuance and richness of natural language will provide valuable depth. However, machine-analysis algorithms expect consistent knowledge, and can't understand nuance. As a consequence, knowledge must be carefully structured as a first step to (or prior to) knowledge analysis. Computer systems work most efficiently if they can store multiple things that are all identical in size and structure. Economical representation, access, and the analysis of semi-structured knowledge require further work. 
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Personal privacy</strong></span>: There is a lot of personal information that is captured, stored, analyzed, and processed through <span class="strong"><strong>internet service providers</strong></span> (<span><span class="strong"><strong>ISPs</strong></span>)</span>, mobile networks, operators, supermarkets, <span>local transportation</span>, educational institutions, and medical and financial <span>service</span><a id="id325792001" class="indexterm"></a> organizations, including hospitals, banks, insurance companies, and credit card agencies. A great deal of information is being stored on social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, and Google. This illuminates that privacy is an issue whose importance, particularly to the customer, is growing as the value of big data becomes more apparent. This personal data is used by mining algorithms to personalize news content and to manage ads, and for other e-commerce advantages. This is clearly a violation of personal privacy. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span>: As the name suggests, big data is massive. When there is an increase in size, there are underlying issues that accompany it in terms of storage, retrieval, processing, transformation, and analysis. As mentioned in the introduction, data volume is scaling much faster than computer resources and CPU speeds, which are static. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Timeliness</strong></span>: This is concerned with speed, as the larger the size of the data to be processed, the longer it will take to analyze it. There are many scenarios where in the results of the analysis are required in real-time or immediately. This creates an extra challenge when building a system that can process the big data in a timely manner. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Securing big data</strong></span>:<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>Security is also a big concern for <span>both</span><a id="id325803745" class="indexterm"></a> enterprises and individuals. Big data stores can be engaging targets for hackers or complex persistent threats. Security is an essential attribute in the big data architecture that reveals ways to store and provide access to information securely. </li></ul></div></div></div>
