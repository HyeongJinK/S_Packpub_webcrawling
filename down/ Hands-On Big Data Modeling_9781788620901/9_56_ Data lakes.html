When it comes to such a dynamic storage system, traditional storage systems don't fit big data challenges for streaming and batch processing applications. That is where the concept of data lakes comes in.</p><p>We can store all structured and unstructured data at various scales, in a centralized repository. Such a repository is referred to as a <span class="strong"><strong>data lake</strong></span>. We can store our data as it is, without having to structure or preprocess the data. In addition to that, we can execute various types of analytics and visualizations, and even real-time analytics.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec70"></a>Differences between data lakes and data warehouses</h3></div></div></div><p><span>The</span> primary purpose of both <span>data</span><a id="id326583606" class="indexterm"></a> warehouses and data lakes is storage.

This process results in a structured data model. In a data lake, all of the data is retained, no matter of how much is used. This data is made available to users, who users can consume the data at any point in time, and can perform business analysis on it. Data lakes support every type of data. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec71"></a>How a data lake works</h3></div></div></div><p>The following diagram shows how a typical data lake works. The <span>data</span><a id="id325591968" class="indexterm"></a> gets loaded from its source. Then it stores the data in its native format, until it is required. Once the data is required, the application can freely read the <span>data</span><a id="id325591976" class="indexterm"></a> and add a structure to it. This is what we refer to as <span class="strong"><strong>schema-on-read</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/d336771b-e2c4-4bce-8e4f-d0e74ff45d78.png" /></div><p>Figure 9.1 - How data lakes work</p><p>In a traditional <span>data warehouse</span>, the data is loaded into the warehouse after being transformed into a well-defined format. This is what we call <span class="strong"><strong>schema-on-write</strong></span>. Any application that uses the <span>data</span><a id="id325789384" class="indexterm"></a> needs to know this format. In this approach, <span>data</span><a id="id325791954" class="indexterm"></a> is not loaded into the warehouse unless there is a use for it. However, the schema-on-read approach of data lakes ensures that all of the data is stored for use at a later time.</p></div></div>
