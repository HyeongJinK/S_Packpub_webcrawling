Streaming data, unlike other data, holds all the truth, and this data processing is profitable in most scenarios. In this section, we are going to explore the importance and implications of streaming data. </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec66"></a>Needs for stream processing</h3></div></div></div><p>Big data has proved to derive insights from the <span>data</span><a id="id325808099" class="indexterm"></a> that has been successfully used in business intelligence and the enhancement of the existing system. Some of these insights have much higher values shortly after it has occurred. Stream processing targets such scenarios. The following are some of the reasons to use stream processing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span>There</span> is a never-ending stream of events occurring in real life. Streaming is required to process these datasets. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">In the scenario where there is a huge volume of data, it is more flexible to stream right away than to store it. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Streaming processing allows loading shed.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We require live streaming of data in many scenarios, such as video-chatting or -conferencing, music delivery, and streaming big data. Having these huge amount of streaming data available, we need a fault-tolerant process to stream over the internet. </li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec67"></a>Challenges with streaming data</h3></div></div></div><p>Data streaming processing operates on two layers: the storage layer and the processing layer. The storage layer needs to be consistent, efficient, fast, and cheap. The processing layer spends a lot of <span>data</span><a id="id325806806" class="indexterm"></a> from the storage layer and runs various computations on this data. In addition to that, the processing layer is responsible for notifications and alerts. It is very challenging to maintain these scalability features, data durability, and fault-tolerance in both of these layers. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec68"></a>Streaming data solutions</h3></div></div></div><p><span>There</span> are several solutions available on the market to work on <span>streaming</span><a id="id325806782" class="indexterm"></a> data. Some of the most commonly-used solutions are Amazon Kinesis Streams, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, and Apache <span>Spark</span><a id="id325806683" class="indexterm"></a> Streaming. Spark Streaming (<a class="ulink" href="http://spark.apache.org/streaming/" target="_blank">http://spark.apache.org/streaming/</a>) is one of the more recent streaming technologies. The framework is easy to use and is built for scalability and for fault-tolerant streaming applications. The most striking characteristics of Apache Spark Steaming include its ease of use, fault-tolerance, Spark integration, and a large community. </p></div></div>
