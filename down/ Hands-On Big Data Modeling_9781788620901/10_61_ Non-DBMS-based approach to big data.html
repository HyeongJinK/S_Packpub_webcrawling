However, several applications dealing with simple and small datasets use this approach even today. Data is stored and processed using separate files in this approach. For example, each user defines and implements their own files that are required for any particular application. One of the use cases is how grade-reporting offices store the record of each student and their grades. Each file holds information on a unique student. In a similar fashion, an accounting department may keep separate files for each student related to their fees. This gives an overview of how data redundancy can be one of the major issues here. As a result of this redundancy, a lot of storage spaces are wasted. In the next section, we are going to explore some of the issues that we can find in file-processing systems.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec36"></a>Problems with processing files</h4></div></div></div><p>File-processing is adequate for <span>many</span><a id="id325879752" class="indexterm"></a> information systems, and it has been a backbone of the computer industry for many years. However, it has some problems and limitations. These are summarized as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data redundancy</strong></span>: In a filesystem-oriented approach, the same data item is often embodied in many diverse files. This repetition of the same data items in more than one file is comprehended as data redundancy. Data redundancy wastes storage space and boosts the cost to keep common data up to date.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data integrity problems</strong></span>: In a file-oriented approach, the validity of the data cannot be checked. Any data can be added to a file. There is no restriction for data at the time of entry. Hence, integrity cannot be enforced (made compulsory). For example, the name field, which only accepts alphabets, also accepts numeric data if the file approach is used, though it is not the valid data for this field.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Inconsistency</strong></span>: The updating of or changes made in one file are not reflected in the other related files. Thus the information does not remain consistent automatically when editing data in one file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sharing problem</strong></span>: In the file-processing system, data cannot be shared. If somebody is using one file, others cannot share that file.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lack of program/data independence</strong></span>: In a file-oriented approach, the <span>application</span><a id="id325337705" class="indexterm"></a> program usually contains data formats that precisely define each data field to be processed. This often results in different files having the same data item stored using different data formats. Data dependence occurs when the data is dependent on the application. Due to a data-dependence problem, when there is a need to add, delete, or change data formats, the application program must also be changed; that is, so that any change to the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access a file.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Limited data security flexibility</strong></span>: A file-oriented approach offers file-level data security. That is, data-access restrictions can be enforced only for the entire file, not for an individual record or a field of a data item.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
