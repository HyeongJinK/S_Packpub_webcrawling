A database is a self-describing collection of integrated records. It is self-describing because the database system contains not only the database itself, but also a complete definition of the database structure and constraints. This definition is stored in the DBMS catalog. The records are integrated because a database contains multiple files (usually called a table in database processing), and records within those tables are processed by their relationship to one another.</p><p>In database processing, the DBMS acts as an intermediary between the user, or application program, and database. A DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing of the database among the various users and applications.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec73"></a>Advantages of the DBMS</h3></div></div></div><p>Having learned about the problems <span>with</span><a id="id326229194" class="indexterm"></a> file processing, in this section we are going to explore some of the features of the database approach and how they are beneficial compared to traditional systems.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec37"></a>Declarative Query Language (DQL)</h4></div></div></div><p>SQL is an example of a declarative <span>query</span><a id="id326229456" class="indexterm"></a> language, where users can <span>express</span><a id="id326229461" class="indexterm"></a> what data to retrieve without a need to know how the engine functions underneath. The users are required to give broad instructions about what task is to be completed rather than specifying how to achieve it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec38"></a>Data independence</h4></div></div></div><p>The applications created over, a DBMS do <span>not</span><a id="id326229495" class="indexterm"></a> need to worry about the <span>storage</span><a id="id326229466" class="indexterm"></a> formats and locations. The term <span class="strong"><strong>data independence</strong></span> relates to the fact that programs are isolated from changes in the way data is structured and stored. A DBMS presents the interface between the application programs and the data.</p><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>physical data independence</strong></span>, the <span>applications</span><a id="id326229441" class="indexterm"></a> do not need to worry about or keep track of how the data are physically structured or stored whereas <span class="strong"><strong>logical data independence</strong></span> is the <span>ability</span><a id="id325804934" class="indexterm"></a> to transform the conceptual schema without having to modify the external schema or application programs. To get a more detailed understanding of physical data independence and logical data independence, check out the resources mentioned in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Further reading</em></span> section.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec39"></a>Controlling data redundancy</h4></div></div></div><p>Unlike file processing, a DBMS <span>approaches</span><a id="id325804950" class="indexterm"></a> control data redundancy. Less redundancy means less wastage of storage space, and hence ease in economic aspects. For businesses, it means there is no need to repeat the same data over and over again.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec40"></a>Centralized data management and concurrent access</h4></div></div></div><p>All the files are integrated into one system, thus <span>reducing</span><a id="id325806673" class="indexterm"></a> redundancies and making data <span>management</span><a id="id325806681" class="indexterm"></a> more efficient. In addition to this, multiple users can access the same piece of information without any conflict.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec41"></a>Data integrity</h4></div></div></div><p>This refers to the fact that a DBMS should maintain and <span>ensure</span><a id="id325806790" class="indexterm"></a> the accuracy and consistency of the data over its entire life cycle. All information in a database is accessible by several users, but only one user can change a piece of data at a time.</p><p>In databases, a single logical operation on the data is <span>called</span><a id="id325806801" class="indexterm"></a> a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank to another. <span class="strong"><strong>Atomicity[2]</strong></span> is one of the four properties that a transaction should have. The <span>four</span><a id="id325806811" class="indexterm"></a> properties, collectively, are called <span class="strong"><strong>ACID</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Atomicity</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Consistency</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Isolation</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Durability</strong></span>).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec42"></a>Data availability</h4></div></div></div><p>One of the greatest advantages of using a <span>DBMS</span><a id="id325808142" class="indexterm"></a> is that the same business data can be made available to different employees anytime, anywhere. It enables remote, 24/7, and multiuser access to information. Not only that standard can be enforced in the DBMS, because all the data in the database is accessed by a centralized database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec43"></a>Efficient access through optimization</h4></div></div></div><p>The DBMS system automatically finds an efficient way to access the data. These systems have built powerful data structures, algorithms, and sound principles to determine how a specific array should be saved and retrieved effectively, despite the size of the data and the complexity of the tables.</p></div></div></div>
