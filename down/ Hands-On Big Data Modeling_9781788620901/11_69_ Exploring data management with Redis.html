Follow the official instructions documented on its website (<a class="ulink" href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">https://redis.io/</a>) to install it on a Windows machine. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec78"></a>Advanced key-value stores</h3></div></div></div><p>An important aspect of <span>Redis</span><a id="id325808157" class="indexterm"></a> is the key-value pair. Redis calls itself an in-memory data-structure store. In simple terms, Redis is not a full-blown DBMS. It can persist data on disks, and does so to save its state, but its intended use is to optimally use memory and memory-based methods to make a number of common data structures very fast for lots of users. Redis supports the following data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.</p><p>The flexibility of Redis permits a wide diversity of how keys are structured and saved. The performance and maintainability of Redis can be either positively or negatively impacted by the choices made in designing and constructing the Redis keys applied in one's database. A good general practice when designing one's Redis keys is to construct at least a rough outline of what information you are trying to store in Redis and an initial idea of how the data will be stored in one of the many different Redis data structures.</p><p> </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec79"></a>Redis and Hadoop</h3></div></div></div><p>Redis is categorized as a high-performance key-value database that has become an essential part of big data applications. It supports enterprises, making sense of data by making database-scaling more convenient and cost-effective. </p><p>Having that said about Redis, we know <span>Hadoop</span><a id="id325811463" class="indexterm"></a> is a distributed computing platform. It has high availability, expandability, fault-tolerance, and low operating costs. Hadoop's HDFS storage system makes it difficult to face end user applications. So, computing results are sent offline to user-facing storage such as Redis. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Horizontal scalability</strong></span> refers to the <span>ability</span><a id="id325813593" class="indexterm"></a> of a system to achieve scalability when the number of machines it operates on is increased. Redis permits data partitioning through range partitioning and hash partitioning. Suppose we have 10 machines, and we pick the key and use the hash function to get back a number. We represent the number, module 10, and the result, in this case 2, is the machine to which the record will be allocated. <span class="strong"><strong>Replication</strong></span> is <span>accomplished</span><a id="id325813604" class="indexterm"></a> in Redis through master-slave mode. Clients read from the slaves to scale up the read performance. The replication process is synchronous. </p></div></div>
