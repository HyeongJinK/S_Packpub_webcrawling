A data model provides a visual representation of these aspects. In addition to providing visual cues, a data model acts as a communication guideline between technical and non-technical stakeholders, such as people. Since a data model is composed of symbols that illustrate the concepts that should be communicated and agreed upon, it is <span>often</span><a id="id326587015" class="indexterm"></a> termed the <span class="strong"><strong>blueprint of the data</strong></span>. These so-called blueprints are constructed at several distinct levels and details, ranging from high-level requirements, to basic architectural layout requirements, to detailed design specifications. These blueprints (or models) can be constructed at different levels of design, referred to as <span class="strong"><strong>levels of data modeling</strong></span>. There are three levels of data modeling: conceptual data modeling, logical data modeling, and physical data modeling. </p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>conceptual data model</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CDM</strong></span>) resides <span>at</span><a id="id325813639" class="indexterm"></a> the top, providing a <span>satellite</span><a id="id325813645" class="indexterm"></a> view of the business solution. Also, the CDM gives a context and scope to the <span class="strong"><strong>logical data model</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LDM</strong></span>), which produces a <span>detailed</span><a id="id325815950" class="indexterm"></a> business solution. The LDM is the starting point for applying the influence of technology in the physical data model. The following diagram illustrates the different levels of data modeling, along with their <span>purposes:</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/6184cf0f-ee4d-4f61-a074-c23102bbaef6.jpg" /></div><p>Figure 4.1: Different levels of data modeling</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec36"></a>Conceptual data modeling</h3></div></div></div><p>Conceptual data modeling is the first <span>step</span><a id="id326194706" class="indexterm"></a> in the top-down approach, where the <span>goal</span><a id="id326194720" class="indexterm"></a> is to capture a satellite view of the business requirements of an organization. As has been claimed by many authors, the main reason for conceptual data modeling is to capture the big picture and comprehend the scope of the high-level requirements of an organization's project. It is worth noting that CDMs are created as a precursor to an LDM or as an alternative to it. </p><p><span>Conceptual data modeling tries to</span> answer the following questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What problems are involved with the business and require immediate solutions? </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">What are the core concepts of these problems?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How are these problems related to one another?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Is there any scope of the effort? What is the scope in relation to the effort made?</li></ul></div><p>The conceptual data modeling process results in a CDM. The model that is created illustrates the key concepts required for a particular application's development. In addition, the model provides a brief overview of the effort required by the company to construct the software:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/3cb735b4-8ff8-4433-a612-7ef9a02bc039.png" /></div><p>Figure 4.2: CDM for a supermarket, with sales figure measurements</p><p>The preceding diagram shows a conceptual <span>model</span><a id="id326262293" class="indexterm"></a> for a supermarket that <span>wants</span><a id="id326262301" class="indexterm"></a> to measure its sales. As shown in the model, the supermarket intends to keep store dimension, product dimension, and time dimension to generate sales facts. The preceding diagram clearly illustrates that the company wants to measure the sales per product, per dimension, and per date. Conceptual data modeling helps to determine the scope and direction of the application under consideration. In addition, it helps to create a preliminary analysis and definitions of key terms. The conceptual model comprises the most important concepts of the project and requirements that each of those concepts can be defined, and documented. To summarize, the CDM explores the topmost relationships between several entities. Hence, this type of <span>model</span><a id="id326262313" class="indexterm"></a> can be referred to as a <span class="strong"><strong>domain model</strong></span>. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec37"></a>Logical data modeling</h3></div></div></div><p><span>An LDM</span> is utilized as the initial step of the <span>physical</span><a id="id326262336" class="indexterm"></a> data model. The <span>LDM</span><a id="id326264257" class="indexterm"></a> consists of the detailed structures of a system. In addition, the LDM depicts the detailed relationships between the structures. An LDM can be described as detailed if it contains all of the essential entities, attributes, and key groups, and the relationships they have with one another. The LDM does not rely on the types of DBMSs used. So, the models should look the same regardless of the type of DBMS system, such as MongoDB, Oracle, and so on.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec21"></a>Benefits of constructing LDMs</h4></div></div></div><p>The following list <span>describes</span><a id="id326264272" class="indexterm"></a> the main benefits of constructing LDMs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">It facilitates an understanding of business data elements and their requirements</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It provides a foundation for designing the database</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It helps to avoid data redundancy and prevents data and business inconsistency</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It promotes data reusability and sharing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It diminishes development, maintenance cost, and time consumption</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">It confirms a logical process model and helps to impact analysis</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/e02206a6-7e13-4a17-be9e-49a89e923ef8.png" /></div><p>Figure 4.3: LDM of the supermarket shown in Figure 4.2</p><p>The preceding diagram shows the LDM of the supermarket shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 4.2</em></span>.

The LDM will explain one technology-independent perspective, and then we can map this business perspective to each of the various technology perspectives. Logical data modeling involves completing four steps, including filling in the CDM, normalizing and abstracting the model, determining the most useful form, and finally reviewing and confirming the logical model. The most common features of a logical model involve the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">All entities and relationships among the model are given</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">All attributes are specified for each entity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The primary key is specified for each entity</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Foreign keys are specified</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Normalization occurs at this level</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"></a>Physical data modeling</h3></div></div></div><p><span>A physical data</span> model illustrates how <span>the</span><a id="id326475715" class="indexterm"></a> different elements will be constructed, as per <span>business</span><a id="id326475723" class="indexterm"></a> requirements that were provided in the LDM. It gives a visual illustration of the physical structure of an actual database. It may also include components of the LDM that have been refactored, in order to optimize the database and enhance the application's performance. In the physical data model, objects are defined at a schema level. Here, a <span class="strong"><strong>schema</strong></span> can be defined as a <span>group</span><a id="id326476777" class="indexterm"></a> of related objects in a database. To summarize, a model can be referred to as a physical data model if it contains all table structures, including column names, column data types, primary keys, column constraints, and the relationship between tables. An instance of the physical model can be seen in the preceding diagram.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec22"></a>Features of the physical data model</h4></div></div></div><p>As mentioned previously, a physical data model shows <span>the</span><a id="id326476792" class="indexterm"></a> way in which the database is built, using the model. In this section, you will learn about the various features of an LDM. <span>Some noticeable features of a physical data model are given as follows</span>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The model represents all tables and columns</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The physical model contains all of the foreign keys that are utilized to recognize relationships between tables</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The physical data model varies for different RDBMS</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Based on the user requirements, denormalization can occur in this model</li></ul></div><p>When logical data modeling is complete, it is expected to produce a server model diagram that shows tables, columns, keys, and relationships within the database. In addition, user feedback documentation and database design documentation are expected to be produced. The following diagram shows the physical data model of the supermarket referred to in the preceding diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788620901/graphics/f6ea9656-28c4-44e4-86bb-47283f5b2470.png" /></div><p>Figure 4.4: Physical data model of the supermarket from Figure 4.3</p><p>The design of a <span>physical</span><a id="id326550497" class="indexterm"></a> data model adheres to the technology that it will be implemented with, and it is optimized according to that technology's requirements.
