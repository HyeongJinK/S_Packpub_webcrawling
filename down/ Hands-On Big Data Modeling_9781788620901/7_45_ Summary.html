Despite its ubiquity, it is very difficult to mine and model this data using a traditional database-management system. This complexity was the driving force to develop another DBMS that can handle unstructured datasets. In this chapter, we learned about Weka, KNIME, and the R programming language, and discussed how they can be used in modeling unstructured datasets.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn about streaming datasets, and try to model streaming data using Python and other tools.Â </p></div>
