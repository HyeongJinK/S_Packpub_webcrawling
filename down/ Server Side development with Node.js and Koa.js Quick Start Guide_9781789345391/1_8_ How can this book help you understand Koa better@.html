In the course of this book, we will examine important concepts in Koa, such as the request, response, and context objects. We will also look at other concepts that will be helpful for building real-world applications such as request and error handling.</p><p>We will build two applications to reinforce the concepts we learned about Koa. These applications will include a REST API and a fully-fledged web application.</p><p>As we build the REST API, we will learn how to create routes, handle requests, and send responses from their APIs. We will also learn practically how the context object works for API creation. We will build an API <span>that</span><a id="id325749027" class="indexterm"></a> will have <span class="strong"><strong>CRUD</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Create, Read, Update,</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span>) functionality; hence, we will also be interacting with a database. Building a real-life application will also afford us the chance to learn about how you can decide to structure your Koa applications.</p><p>Building the fully-fledged web application will allow us to learn how to build an application in Koa with views and templates. We will also learn how to authenticate, handle forms, handle sessions, and so on, in the framework.</p></div>
