We have learned, with code examples, how to define and register our own custom error-handling middleware. We also learned about the error event in Koa and how to define listeners for centralized logging and other purposes.</p><p>The use of <code class="literal">async... await</code> in Koa makes error handling a lot easier than in traditional middleware-based frameworks, as we simply have to define <code class="literal">try... catch</code> statements to do most of the heavy lifting.</p><p>Proper error handling is a must-have for almost all applications going into production. This is another reason why Koa is such a great choice for production-grade HTTP applications.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be building a Koa application from scratch, and we will utilize all the information we have learned from the previous lessons.</p></div>
