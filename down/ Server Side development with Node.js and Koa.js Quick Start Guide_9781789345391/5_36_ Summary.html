You learned how to structure your projects in a modular manner when developing APIs in Koa. You also learned how to implement logging, routing, and validation on a CRUD API.</p><p>Koa shows us how easy it is to get started in API development, and we are really only limited by our imagination when it comes to building robust APIs with the framework.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will focus on building a blog with Koa.
