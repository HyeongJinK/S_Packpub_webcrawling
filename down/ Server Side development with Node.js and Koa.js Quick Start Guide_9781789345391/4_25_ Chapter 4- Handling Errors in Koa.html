It is an important part of software development; hence, developers spend a lot of time trying to handle errors properly. It is important to note that these errors may either be asynchronous or synchronous. Proper error handling by developers makes use of their applications more seamless.</p><p>Koa's use of asynchronous functions makes error handling easier than it is in other Node frameworks, which implement callbacks.</p><p>In this chapter, we will learn about error handling in Koa and how we can take advantage of the tooling in Koa for proper error handling. Some of the things we will learn in this chapter include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Catching errors in Koa</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The error event and listener</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Throwing HTTP errors</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Writing error handlers</li></ul></div></div>
