APIs give developers the opportunity to offer the same web services to multiple clients, while also reducing the coupling between their systems.</p><p>In this chapter, we will build a REST API using Koa. We will make use of the different Koa concepts that we covered in the previous chapters in order to build a full-fledged API.</p><p>The API that we will build will be for managing contacts. We will be able to perform <span class="strong"><strong>create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)</strong></span> operations on contacts in our database via the API. We will persist and retrieve data to and from a MongoDB database, using Mongoose. We will also make use of Nodemon to debug our applications, and Postman to test our APIs.</p><p>Through building the API, you will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to build a CRUD service in Koa</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to send JSON data back as a response</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to structure an API in Koa</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to implement logging for all requests that are made</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to set up routing in a Koa application</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to retrieve and process request body data in Koa</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to implement validation in Node APIs</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to define and implement custom middleware in a real-world application</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"></a>Note</h3><p>
