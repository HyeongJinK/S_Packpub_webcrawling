We've also looked at backporting Neovim defaults to Vim to synchronize the editing experience between the two.</p><p>Finally, we've taken a brief look at some of the plugins the Neovim community have built.</p><p>Next chapter will point at a few more Vim-related resources and communities, as well as leave the reader with a few ideas and further exploration avenues.</p></div>
