"There were plugins to do this all along?" Indeed, there are <span>plugins</span><a id="id325580775" class="indexterm"></a> that support refactoring operations—be it modifying parameters, renaming, or method extraction.</p><p>However, when working with existing refactoring solutions, I always find they do almost, but not quite, what I need. That's why I continue to write fancy substitute commands for refactoring. I find the cost of incorporating a refactoring plugin into my workflow, only to switch to <code class="literal">:substitute</code> commands for some of my refactoring needs, too high.</p><p>At the time of writing this book, there's no go-to refactoring plugin. Some are language-specific, and some focus on only certain aspects of refactoring. For instance, plugins like YouCompleteMe provide semantically-aware renaming commands (such as <code class="literal">:YcmComplete RefactorRename</code>).</p><p>Your best bet is to figure out for yourself which operations you want to perform, and try out a few plugins based on that. A web search along the lines of "Vim refactoring plugins" should do the trick.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
