These limitations guided Vi towards establishing an efficient and deliberate editing process, which is what's at the core of Vim—Vi Improved today.</p><p>In this chapter, you've learned how to install and update Vim and it's graphical counterpart—GVim, on every major platform (in more ways than you will ever need).</p><p>You've learned to configure your Vim through tinkering with <code class="literal">.vimrc</code>, which is something you will often go back to as you customize the editor for your own needs.</p><p>You've picked up the basics of working with files, moving around Vim, and making changes. Vim's concept of text objects (letters, words, paragraphs) and composite commands (like <code class="literal">d2w</code> - <span class="strong"><strong>d</strong></span>elete <span class="strong"><strong>2</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>w</strong></span>ords) empower precise text operations.</p><p>And if there's one thing you could take away from this chapter, it would be <code class="literal">:help</code>. Vim's internal help system is incredibly detailed, and it can answer most, if not every, question you might have, as long as you know what you're looking for.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll be looking into getting more out of Vim. You'll learn how to navigate files and get better at editing text.</p></div>
