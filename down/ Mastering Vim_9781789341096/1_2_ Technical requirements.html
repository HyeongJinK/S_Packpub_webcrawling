You don't have to download any code to follow along with this chapter as we'll be creating files from scratch. However, if you ever get lost and need more guidance, you can view the resulting code on GitHub:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Vim/tree/master/Chapter01" target="_blank">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Vim/tree/master/Chapter01</a></p><p>We will be using Vim to primarily write Python code throughout this book, and it is assumed that the reader is somewhat familiar with the language. Examples assume you're using Python 3 syntax.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip3"></a>Note</h3><p>If you must live in the past, you can convert Python 3 examples to Python 2 code by changing the <code class="literal">print()</code> command syntax. Change all of <code class="literal">print('Woof!')</code> to <code class="literal">print 'Woof!'</code> to make the code run in Python 2.</p></div><p>We will also be creating and modifying Vim configuration, which is stored in a <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> file. The resulting <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> file is available from the previously mentioned GitHub link.</p></div>
