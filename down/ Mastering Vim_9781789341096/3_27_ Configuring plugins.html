It's a good idea to review the available options and commands for the plugins you use. Sane plugin defaults make a huge difference in experience. Creating shortcuts that are easy for you to remember will help you remember how to use the plugin you forgot about in a few months.</p><p>Vim allows for the creation of global variables, which are primarily used to configure plugins. Global variables are usually prefixed by <code class="literal">g:</code>. You can find a list of configuration options in the plugin documentation by running <code class="literal">:help &lt;plugin-name&gt;</code> and looking for options.</p><p>For example, opening a help file for the CtrlP plugin (by running <code class="literal">:help ctrlp</code>) and searching for options (<code class="literal">/options</code>) yields the following:</p><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/f477442b-4960-4d17-8ebc-71e9ef723b0c.png" /></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note78"></a>Note</h3><p>You can read more about the CtrlP plugin under <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Editing and Navigation</em></span>.</p></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>If we follow the <code class="literal">ctrlp-options</code> link (by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <code class="literal">]</code>), we will be taken to a list of available options:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/f8b7e7b1-7f7a-49c2-a6f0-758463905460.png" /></div><p>Let's pick an interesting option to explore, say <code class="literal">ctrlp_working_path_mode</code>. Move your cursor over to the link, and press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl </em></span>+ <span class="emphasis"><em>]</em></span> to follow it further:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/4fca6273-170c-47cf-a2a1-fc4003eaea11.png" /></div><p>It looks like this option guards how CtrlP sets a local working directory. If we wanted to change it to look for a root folder of our Git project (with a fallback to the current working directory), we would change our <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> file accordingly:</p><pre class="programlisting">" Set CtrlP working directory to a repository root (with a
" fallback to current directory).
  let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 'ra'</pre><p>Digging through the available options for plugins takes time; however, it might make you much more productive or even completely change the way you use the plugins.</p><p>Remember the leader key? It comes in very handy with plugins, as it provides a full namespace for plugins to use. Some plugins already use the leader key for their default key bindings, others not so much. You can <span>always</span><a id="id325545978" class="indexterm"></a> make your own easy to remember mappings!</p><p>For example, all three CtrlP modes can be easily accessed with two key presses:</p><pre class="programlisting">" Remap CtrlP actions to be prefixed by a leader key.
 noremap &lt;leader&gt;p :CtrlP&lt;cr&gt;
 noremap &lt;leader&gt;b :CtrlPBuffer&lt;cr&gt;
 noremap &lt;leader&gt;m :CtrlPMRU&lt;cr&gt;</pre><p>I find it extremely useful to take some time to optimize my key mappings or customize plugin options. Small investment and some mindfulness goes a long way in getting the most out of your setup.</p></div>
