Scroll through using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Page Up</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Page Down</em></span> keys (bonus point for using <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>b</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>f</em></span> respectively), there is a lot of useful information there.</p><p>Whenever you are stuck, or want to learn more about a particular command, try searching it using <code class="literal">:help</code> (you can shorten it to <code class="literal">:h</code>). Let's try searching for a <code class="literal">cc</code> command we've learned :</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>:h cc</strong></span></pre><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/2454ecae-b5e4-4df3-b13c-a9376e6a693e.png" /></div><p>Help tells us the way the command works, as well as how different options and settings affect the command (for instance <code class="literal">autoindent</code>setting preserves the indentation).</p><p><code class="literal">:help</code> is a command which navigates a set of help files. As you look through the help files, you'll notice that certain words are highlighted in color. These are tags, and can be searched for using the <code class="literal">:help</code> command. Unfortunately, not every tag name is intuitive. For instance, if we wanted to learn how to <span>search</span><a id="id325844899" class="indexterm"></a> for a string in Vim, we could try using the following:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>:h search</strong></span></pre><p>However, it looks like this command takes us to the entry on expression evaluation, which is not exactly what we were looking for, as demonstrated by the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/6cb4972c-4c67-48f6-b5d3-3b0b80349c40.png" /></div><p>To find the right entry, type in <code class="literal">:h search</code> (don't hit <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> yet) followed by <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + d. This will give you a list of help tags containing the substring <code class="literal">search</code>. One of the options shown is <code class="literal">search-commands</code> which is what we'd be looking for. Complete your command in the following way to get to the entry we were looking for:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>:h search-commands</strong></span></pre><p>The following display shows the <span>right</span><a id="id325844986" class="indexterm"></a> help entry for search:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789341096/graphics/311b4bff-4440-4d2c-9570-7f1a609816a8.png" /></div><p></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip33"></a>Note</h3><p>Speaking of search functionality, you can search inside help pages (or any file open in Vim) using <code class="literal">/search term</code> to search forward from the cursor or <code class="literal">?search term</code> to search backward.
