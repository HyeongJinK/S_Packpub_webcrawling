The new shiny thing is vim-plug, a lightweight plugin manager that can asynchronously install and update your plugins. Vundle, its predecessor, also allows you to search for and temporarily install new plugins. We've also learned how to manually work with plugins: Vim 8.0 introduced a way to load plugins without the need to manually alter <code class="literal">runtimepath</code> for each plugin. If you still use Vim below version 8, then Pathogen provides a way to automate some of the <code class="literal">runtimepath</code> manipulation.</p><p>We've looked at profiling Vim with a <code class="literal">--startuptime</code> flag and the <code class="literal">:profile</code> command.</p><p>We've revisited modes, covering every major mode: normal mode, command-line and ex modes, insert mode, visual and select modes, and terminal mode.</p><p>We've talked about remapping commands to make Vim truly yours. Different key combinations are more convenient and easier to remember for different people. Vim allows you to remap keys based on the mode you're in, meaning you can alter the behavior of every key press. We've covered the leader key, which allows you to access a whole new namespace that's reserved for plugins and user-defined commands.</p><p>We've also looked into the ways we can squeeze the most out of our plugins by customizing their configuration options and adding key bindings that make more sense in our own unique workflow.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll cover autocomplete, navigating large code bases with tags, and traversing Vim's undo tree.</p></div>
