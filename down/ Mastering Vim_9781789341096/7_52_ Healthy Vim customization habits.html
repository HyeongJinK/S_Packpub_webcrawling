It's important to take time to go back, reflect, and make sure your <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> doesn't become a pile of unneeded aliases, functions, and plugins.</p><p>Once in a while, take the time to go back into your <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> and clean up unnecessary functions and plugins, or remove key bindings you don't use any more. If you don't know what something does, you're probably better off deleting it, since you won't get much use out of configurations you don't understand.</p><p>It's also helpful to take some time to read about the options you have set and plugins you have installed with the built-in <code class="literal">:help</code> command—you'll never know what useful feature you'll discover!</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec63"></a>Optimizing your workflow</h3></div></div></div><p>Everyone's workflow is unique, and no two <span>people</span><a id="id326537950" class="indexterm"></a> use Vim in exactly the same way. It's useful to find ways to compliment your style by enhancing and optimizing the way you do things in Vim.</p><p>Find yourself using a particular command a lot? Create a custom key binding!</p><p>For example, I use the CtrlP plugin quite a lot (both for navigating the file tree and the buffer list), and I have the following custom mappings:</p><pre class="programlisting">nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;p :CtrlP &lt;cr&gt;
nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;t :CtrlPTag &lt;cr&gt;</pre><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I also often find myself running the <code class="literal">:Ack</code> command (provided by the ack-vim plugin) on a word under cursor, so I have the following in my <code class="literal">.vimrc</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;a :Ack! &lt;c-r&gt;&lt;c-w&gt;&lt;cr&gt;</pre><p>The &lt;c-r&gt; and &lt;c-w&gt; inserts the word under cursor into the command line. Use <code class="literal">:grep</code> for a similar purpose? Not a problem:</p><pre class="programlisting">nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;g :grep &lt;c-r&gt;&lt;c-w&gt; */**&lt;cr&gt;</pre><p>Accidentally find yourself hitting <code class="literal">;</code> instead of <code class="literal">:</code> to enter command-line mode? Remap it:</p><pre class="programlisting">nnoremap ; :
vnoremap ; :</pre><p>Whenever you catch yourself doing something a lot, take a moment to add a relevant key binding to make your life easier.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec64"></a>Keeping .vimrc organized</h3></div></div></div><p>If you use and customize Vim a lot, your <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> file <span>tends</span><a id="id325845019" class="indexterm"></a> to grow rather quickly, and it's important to make it easy to navigate. If you ever take a break from working with your <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> and come back later, you'll thank yourself.</p><p>Comments are crucial for making sure you remember what's going on. If you take just one thing from this chapter, make sure it is comments. Just like when working with code, comments save you wasting time trying to understand what's going on.</p><p>I try to make a point of documenting every configuration bit with a corresponding comment:</p><pre class="programlisting">" Show last command in the status line.
set showcmd

" Highlight cursor line.
set cursorline

" Ruler (line, column and % at the right bottom).
set ruler

" Display line numbers if terminal is wide enough.
if &amp;co &gt; 80
  set number
endif

" Soft word wrap.
set linebreak

" Prettier display of long lines of text.
set display+=lastline

" Always show statusline.
set laststatus=2</pre><p>Some people might prefer to place the comments on the same line as the configuration bits:</p><pre class="programlisting">set showcmd            " Show last command in the status line.

set cursorline         " Highlight cursor line.

set ruler              " Ruler (line, column and % at the right bottom).

set linebreak          " Soft word wrap.

set display+=lastline  " Prettier display of long lines of text.

set laststatus=2       " Always show statusline.</pre><p>For plugins in particular, I find it extremely useful to add a quick comment explaining what each one of them does. This makes it easy to revise the list of plugins once I don't need certain ones anymore:</p><pre class="programlisting">Plug 'EinfachToll/DidYouMean'           " filename suggestions

I break down my configuration into categories, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>looks</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>editing</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>movement and search</em></span>. Then I use manual fold markers (<code class="literal">{{{1</code>) to indicate folds.</p><p>I also tend to add some ASCII art in the form of arrows <code class="literal">=&gt;</code> and lines <code class="literal">---</code> to make each section look more like a header:</p><pre class="programlisting">...
