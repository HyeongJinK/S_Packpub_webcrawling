Git is the version control system of choice for this chapter; however, the lessons learned are applicable across different systems. A section is dedicated to a quick-and-dirty introduction but, if you want to get the most out of version control systems, you may want to read up on the version control system of your choice.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we'll be making changes to our <code class="literal">.vimrc</code> file. You can make these changes as you go, or download them from GitHub at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Vim/tree/master/Chapter05" target="_blank">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Vim/tree/master/Chapter05</a>.
