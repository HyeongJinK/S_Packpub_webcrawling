We looked at code autocomplete using Vim's built-in autocomplete functionality. We also looked at YouCompleteMe, a plugin that makes autocomplete syntactically aware. We also looked at Exuberant Ctags as a way to navigate more complex code bases. Lastly, we looked at Vim's undo tree and Gundo, a plugin that makes navigating the undo tree more intuitive.</p><p>In the following chapter, we'll dive into combining Vim and version control and dealing with merge conflicts. We'll also dive into ways to build, test, and execute code in a Vim-friendly manner.</p></div>
