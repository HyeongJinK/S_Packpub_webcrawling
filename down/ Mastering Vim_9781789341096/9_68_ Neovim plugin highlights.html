It's worth mentioning that Vim added some of the features unique to Neovim in 8.0 (asynchronous plugin support) and 8.1 (Terminal mode) a few years after Neovim was created.</p><p>All of the following plugins (except for NyaoVim) were backported to Vim, but it's worth giving the Neovim community credit for the crea</p><p>tion of the plugins. The list is not in any way extensive, and might get out of date pretty quickly. The plugins are rated by popularity as of the time of writing of this book:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dein (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim" target="_blank">https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim</a>) is an asynchronous plugin manager, similar to vim-plug.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Denite (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim" target="_blank">https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim</a>) is a fuzzy search plugin for everything, including buffers, lines in the current files, or even color schemes (effectively a CtrlP for everything).
