We looked into arglist, which is a way to execute a command across multiple files.</p><p>The <code class="literal">:substitute</code> command also supports regular expressions, which make your life a lot easier by allowing you to go beyond literal matches. We covered the basics of regular expressions and Vim magic modes (which are ways of interpreting special characters when parsing regex-enabled strings).</p><p>Finally, we looked at macros: a feature that lets you record and later replay a set of keystrokes. Macros can be edited the same way that registers can, and can also be made recursive to play as many times as needed.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll cover customizing Vim for a personalized editing experience.</p></div>
