You have learned what the available inputs and outputs are and how to configure them. What is more, you were able to write your first query, and check how the query language works for analyzing and processing incoming events. If you need a PaaS  that can quickly read and transform events and push them to many different Azure services, Azure Stream Analytics is for you.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will go through Azure Service Bus, an enterprise-class messaging solution that is in fact the foundation of Azure Event Hub, which we discussed previously.</p></div>
