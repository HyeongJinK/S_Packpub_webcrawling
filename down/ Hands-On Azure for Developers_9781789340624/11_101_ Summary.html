We developed a few solutions for Tables, Queues, Files, and Blobs—each enabling you to do different things, from asynchronous message processing to creating file shares. You also read about different redundancy models and how reliable and durable this particular service is. In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Further reading</em></span><span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>section, you will find plenty of additional resources, which will allow you to build even more skills for working with this Azure service, such as Table Storage patterns, performance targets, and a REST API reference. In the following chapters, you will learn something about data processing services, such as Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics.</p></div>
