In the world of software development, proper naming for services is especially difficult as you have to take into account different regions, environments, and instances. In this section, we will try to discover different concepts for naming conventions, which you will able to apply or adjust to your needs.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch21lvl2sec204"></a>Finding the best naming convention</h3></div></div></div><p>In Azure, you have to consider the <span>following</span><a id="id325128371" class="indexterm"></a> aspects of a resource:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A region where it is provisioned</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A resource type</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A resource name</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A resource instance type/environment</li></ul></div><p>We will start from a resource group. By default you can name it as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">MyNewService
newPortal
oldplatform</pre><p>The rule of thumb is to select a name that will be self-explanatory. While selecting a name such as<code class="literal">MyNewService</code> should be fine, it does not give you the following information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Where the resource group is located</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">What environment (test/production/staging/and so on) it represents</li></ul></div><p> </p><p>What is more, if you, for example, list resources inside your subscription, you will not know which resource type <code class="literal">MyNewService</code> is, without selecting its type. While, of course, commands such as<code class="literal">az group list</code><span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>give you the full information about a resource, you will need to include an additional field if you want to export only a resource name. In such cases, it would be worth annotating the resource group name with the resource type as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">MyNewServiceResourceGroup
newPortal-resourceGroup
oldplatform-rg</pre><p>So far so good—the name of the resource looks much better now. Let's now consider adding a location:</p><pre class="programlisting">MyNewResourceResourceGroupEastUS2
newPortal-westEurope-resourceGroup
oldplatform-eun-rg</pre><p>Things look much better now—we immediately know what resource type we are considering and where it is located. With that information it much easier to browse through different services. The last thing that could be added is the environment:</p><pre class="programlisting">MyNewResourceResourceGroupEastUS2Test
newPortal-westEurope-prod-resourceGroup
oldplatform-staging-eun-rg</pre><p>Now the information is complete. Of course, everything depends on your personal setup, as you may decide that all environments are stored inside a single resource group. Even then it is worth including the rest of the data so that you will have cohesive names for all provisioned resources. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip237"></a>Note</h3><p>Remember that different Azure resources have different limits when it comes to their names. While Azure App Services<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>may be quite liberated about this, Azure Storage<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>disallows you from using characters other than letters and numbers.</p></div><p>In fact, your requirements for the naming convention will imply what really has to be included in the resource name, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Whether you deploy resources in different regions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Whether you use multiple environments for developing your applications</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Whether you use a single resource group for multiple environments</li></ul></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>The general rule is to use a convention that you both like, and is flexible enough to cover services deployed to Azure after a few years. The worst thing here is having to change it after some time because it cannot reflect the changes in your business.</p></div></div>
