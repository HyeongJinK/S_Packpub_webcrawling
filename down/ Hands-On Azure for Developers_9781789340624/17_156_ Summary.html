We have covered things such as data structure, security features, and best practices, so you should be able to get started on your own and build your very first solution based on this particular Azure component. Bear in mind that what can easily replace Azure Storage for example—it all depends on your requirements and expectations. If you're looking for a more flexible security model, better performance, and better limits, ADLS is for you. This ends this part of the book, which included services for storing data, monitoring services, and performing communication between them. In the next chapter, you will learn more about scaling, performance, and maintainability in Azure.</p></div>
