Of course, available features are not limited to those we covered in this chapter—you can also leverage functionalities such as continuous deployment, networking, or data volumes. What is available depends solely on the service you choose—Azure Container Instances and Web App for Containers are cloud components that are quite minimalistic and focus on running an application, while AKS delivers more advanced features.
