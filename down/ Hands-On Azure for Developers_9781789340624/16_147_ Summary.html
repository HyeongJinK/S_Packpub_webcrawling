While being a full PaaS Azure component, it still allows for many advanced operations such as sharding, multi-tenancy, AD integration or failover, and geo-replication. Besides being hosted within a cloud, you can still use it in the same way you would a standalone version of SQL Server. In the next chapter, we will cover the last PaaS service mentioned in this book, which is Azure Data Lake Storage.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
