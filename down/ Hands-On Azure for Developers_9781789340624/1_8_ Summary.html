Learning the basics of this particular service is crucial for understanding other topics mentioned in this book, such as WebJobs or Azure Functions. Always remember that you can initially use the <strong class="userinput"><code>Free </code></strong>tier to avoid paying for an application when testing or developing, and then scale up when you need to do so. I strongly recommend you play around a little bit with Web Apps, as the cloud component has a lot more to it, and some other features are not that obvious initially. We will cover more advanced features such as integration with Traffic Manager, Azure SQL database, and scaling scenarios in the next chapters.</p></div>
