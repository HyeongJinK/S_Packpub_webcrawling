We have configured an Azure CDN<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>instance, and saw how to optimize serving content by compressing it. After reading this chapter, you should be able to filter particular content for particular countries, and be able to develop proper caching rules, so that you can define how your instance will behave.</p><p>In the next chapter, which is the last chapter in this book describing Azure services, we will cover one more advanced scenario—distributing load and securing data from outages with Azure Traffic Manager.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
