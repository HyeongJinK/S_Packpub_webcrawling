I strongly encourage you to give it a try and play a little bit with this Azure service as it is a powerful tool for processing thousands of events per second. It is also pretty simple to use and does not require much time to get started.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn about another service for processing many events, and additionally analyze and transform them in near real time—Azure Stream Analytics.</p></div>
