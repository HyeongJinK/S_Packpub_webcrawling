This is because the performance of the hardware is limited and it is easier to add another machine to the set rather than provision a new CPU and memory.</li><li>Not really—while conceptually it could be possible, serverless services avoid scaling up.</li><li>Yes—if you scale out Azure App Service, the price for the service will be multiplied by the number of instances currently working.</li><li>In SF, scaling out is perfectly fine. The dangerous operations are scaling up as it requires you to take your workload from one place and migrate it to another one.</li><li>Manual scaling can be problematic when the traffic your application handles is dynamic—in that case, you would have to constantly monitor it and scale up/out when required.</li><li>You can set the auto-scaling feature and declare the CPU trigger for scaling your application.
