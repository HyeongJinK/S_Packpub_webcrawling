You have learned the basic concepts of SF, such as Reliable services and Reliable actors, and how to implement a communication protocol to exchange messages between services and clients. Remember that building an application based on microservices is not a trivial task and requires sticking to many important rules to avoid problems with dealing with state, monitoring, or scaling. Use SF as a framework for building distributed applications, which takes care of ensuring that they are reliable and highly available.</p><p>Last but not least: do not be discouraged if you have problems with SF or feel overwhelmed by its multiple options and configurations—this particular service has a pretty difficult learning curve, but after reading this whole chapter, you should be able to start writing your very own services without problems.</p><p> </p><p>In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying Web Applications as Containers</em></span>, you will learn about another PaaS service available in Azure: Azure Search, which lets you start using your own search engine to index and query stored documents.</p></div>
