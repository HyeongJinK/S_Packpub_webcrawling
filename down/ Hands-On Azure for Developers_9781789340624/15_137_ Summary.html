We covered things such as provisioning a resource, creating an alert, and integrating with other services. This Azure component offers many additional features besides those mentioned in the chapter—there are things such as smart detection, continuous export of data, or detailed usage logs. I strongly encourage you to explore it further on your own, as it greatly simplifies monitoring activities and resolving issues. In the next chapter, we will cover the last Azure service within the scope of this book: Azure SQL, which is a PaaS service, being an Azure version of the well-known database engine.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
