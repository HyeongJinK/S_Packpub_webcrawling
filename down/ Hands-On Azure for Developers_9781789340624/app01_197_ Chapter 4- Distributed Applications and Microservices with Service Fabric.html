An application is a logical container for multiple services, which serve the same purpose. A service is a single unit of work inside an application, which can be scaled according to need. A partition is an identifier that allows you to correctly distribute the load among services. A replica is a particular instance of a VM used to replicate the state or achieve higher durability of services.</li><li>Five nodes are required to achieve the desired level of resiliency and durability for your cluster and applications hosted within it.</li><li>The reliability tier is used to set the number of VMs inside a node.</li></ol></div></div>
