They start to shine when you have a working web app, which could be used to host them and execute many different actions asynchronously (such as generating a report or reading a queue, which will feed your application's database later). Thanks to the support of different programming languages, you do not have to limit yourself to only one particular platform. Last but not least, they are a great introduction to Azure Functions, which are one of the most popular services in Azure and extend the current possibilities of WebJobs even further. In <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying Web Applications as Containers</em></span>, you will learn about deploying Web Apps as containers, what extends even more the capabilities of App Service when it comes to hosting web applications.</p></div>
