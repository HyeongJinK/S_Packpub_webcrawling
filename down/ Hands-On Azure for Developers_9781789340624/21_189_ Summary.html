You have learned how to use the Azure CLI and Cloud Shell to ease management operations, how to leverage locks to secure all fragile resources, and how to read an Azure service configuration. We also discussed the pros for adopting proper naming conventions and how they affect your applications deployed in Azure. This was an exciting journey through the Azure cloud, where you discovered many different PaaS offerings from this particular platform. Azure is a fantastic ecosystem and allows you to build both small web pages and complex, enterprise-level platforms. What is more, it is also incredibly dynamic—this is why I strongly encourage you to take a look at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Further reading</em></span><span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>sections detailed in this book, so you can get more experience with it and become familiar with the more advanced concepts.

As cloud computing is one of the major topics in recent years when it comes to software development, it is crucial to become familiar with it and build your skill set, which you can use in your daily work.</p></div>
