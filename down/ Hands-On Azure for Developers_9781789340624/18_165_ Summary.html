You saw how this operation works for different application models—sometimes you scale service instances, VMs, or simply you do not control it and let the runtime do it for you. In fact, scaling services in the cloud is much easier than when using your own servers. You do not have to reconfigure load balancers, firewalls, routers, and servers. When using the scaling feature, always try to automate the process—manual scaling works only for very simple scenarios, and tends to keep your servers underutilized.</p><p>In the next two chapters, we will cover two additional Azure services, Azure CDN and Azure Traffic Manager, which help in keeping your applications available, even under heavy load.</p></div>
