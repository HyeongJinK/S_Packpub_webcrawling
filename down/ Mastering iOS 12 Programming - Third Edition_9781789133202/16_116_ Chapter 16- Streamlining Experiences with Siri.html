One of these opportunities is in integrating your application with Siri using the <code class="literal">SiriKit</code> framework.</p><p>In this chapter, you will work on an existing application called Hairdressers. This application allows users to book an appointment with their hairdresser for a certain day, and can also message their hairdresser directly. You will learn how you can integrate Siri Intents extensions to allow users to message their hairdresser through Siri. You will also implement the new Siri shortcuts to allow users to quickly schedule their appointments with their regular hairdresser.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding intents</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing an intents extension</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding a custom UI to a Siri intents extension</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Integrating Siri Shortcuts in your app</li></ul></div><p>If you want to follow along with the code samples in this chapter, make sure to grab the <strong class="userinput"><code>Hairdressers</code></strong> starter project from this book's code bundle. Make sure to examine the existing code, so you understand what's going on inside of the app. The code relies heavily on the knowledge you gained in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding Core Data to Your App</em></span>, so you might want to keep that chapter nearby while you examine the starter code.</p><p> </p></div>
