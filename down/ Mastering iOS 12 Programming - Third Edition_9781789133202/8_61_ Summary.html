You used the Core Data model editor in Xcode to configure the models you wanted to store and define the relationship between these models. Once the models were set up, you implemented code that created instances of your models so they could be stored in the database and retrieved later.</p><p>Next, you retrieved the data from the database and saw that your table view's don't automatically update when the underlying data changes. You used an <code class="literal">NSFetchedResult</code> controller to fetch family members and listen to changes on the list of family members. You saw that this setup is very powerful because you can respond to changes in your data quite easily.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to enrich the data your users add to the database by fetching and storing data from the web.</p></div>
