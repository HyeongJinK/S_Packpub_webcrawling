You gained some insight into what AR is, the basic workings of AR, and what you can do with it. Then you learned about the components that make up an excellent AR experience, and you implemented your first small AR experience by adopting Quicklook in an app to preview AR content in a real AR session.</p><p>Then you explored different ways to render content in an AR scene. You took a quick look at SpriteKit and SceneKit, and learned that SpriteKit is Apple's 2D game-development framework. You also learned that SceneKit is Apple's 3D game framework, which makes it extremely suited for usage in an AR app.</p><p>Then you implemented an AR gallery that uses image tracking, plane detection, and allows users to add their own contents to their gallery. In the process of doing this, you saw that it's not always easy to get ARKit to work well. Bad lighting and other factors can make AR experiences less than ideal.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn about location services and how you can use them to create better experiences for your users.</p></div>
