You also learned that <code class="literal">Operations</code> are a convenient way to reduce complexity in your application, resulting in code that is easier to read, change, and maintain. When an operation depends on multiple other <code class="literal">Operations</code> to be completed, it can be extremely convenient to useÂ <code class="literal">OperationQueue</code>, as it dramatically reduces the complexity of the code you write.</p><p>It's been mentioned before, but if you intend to make use of operations in your app, make sure to check out Apple's Demonstration of Advanced Operations from WWDC 2015. Operations are capable of far more than you've seen in this chapter, and it's highly recommended to see how Apple uses operations to create rock-solid apps. Once your app is covered by tests, measured with instruments, and improved with asynchronous code and operations, it's probably time that you share your app with others.</p><p>The next and final chapter of this book will show you how to set yourself up for deploying your app through TestFlight and the App Store.</p></div>
