Note that these extensions are called apps and not just extensions. This is because iMessage extensions behave a lot like apps even though they're not apps. Also, iMessage apps are distributed through their own iMessage App Store. You will learn more about this later in this chapter.</p><p>First, you will gain a broad understanding of iMessage apps and what possibilities they give you as a developer. Once this is established, you will deep dive into several aspects of iMessage apps in more detail. To be more specific, the following are the topics that will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a sticker pack for iMessage</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing custom, interactive iMessage apps</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding sessions, messages, and conversations</li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how iMessage apps work and how you can create an experience for your users that is fun and engaging.
