In this chapter, you'll learn how to display the same items using a more flexible component. This component is called <code class="literal">UICollectionView</code>, and it has a very similar interface to <code class="literal">UITableView</code>. The most significant difference is that you can define a much more flexible layout using a collection view. An example of this is the grid layout that <code class="literal">UICollectionView</code> provides out of the box. Of course, you are free to implement any layout you want for a collection view. This is probably the most significant advantage a collection view has to offer.</p><p>You will build on top of <span class="strong"><strong>Hello-Contacts</strong></span> by refactoring the existing application to switch from a table view to a collection view. You are going to replace all table-view-related configuration code with its collection view counterparts. You will also make use of a grid layout to show contacts. Lastly, you will create a custom collection view cell, just like you did for the table view.</p><p>To take the grid layout one step further than the default implementation, you will also explore <code class="literal">UICollectionViewFlowLayout</code> to implement a cool custom version of a grid that is a bit more playful than the default version. Since collection views and table views are so similar, you will also implement all of the features that existed for the table view version of the app.</p><p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Converting from a table view to a collection view</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a custom collection view cell</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using <code class="literal">UICollectionViewFlowLayout</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a custom collection view layout</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">User interactions for <code class="literal">UICollectionView</code></li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
