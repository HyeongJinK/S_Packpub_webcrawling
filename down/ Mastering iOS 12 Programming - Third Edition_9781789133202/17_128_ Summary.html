You saw how you can implement a video player with just a couple of lines of code. After that, you learned how to use <code class="literal">AVFoundation</code> directly to build an audio player that supports features such as stopping and resuming playback, skipping songs, and scrubbing forward or backward in a song. You even learned how you can keep playing audio when the app goes to the background or when the phone is set to silent mode. To put the finishing touches to the audio player, you learned how you can use the <code class="literal">MediaPlayer</code> framework to show the currently playing file on the user's lock screen, and to respond to control events that are sent to the app remotely.</p><p>After implementing media playback, you learned how you can build apps that help users to create media. You saw that the <code class="literal">UIImagePickerController</code> provides a quick and simple interface to allow users to take a picture with the camera. You also learned how you can use <code class="literal">AVFoundation</code> and an <code class="literal">AVCaptureSession</code>Â object to implement a custom video recording experience. To wrap it all up, you learned about the <code class="literal">Core Image</code> framework, and how you can use it to apply filters to images.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn everything you need to know about notifications and how you can use them to make significant improvements to your apps.</p></div>
