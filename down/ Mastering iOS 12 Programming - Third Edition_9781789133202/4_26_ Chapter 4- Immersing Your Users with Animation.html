You have already covered a lot of ground by implementing a custom overview page and a contact detail page that both work great on any screen size that exists today. However, you can still make some considerable improvements to this app by implementing awesome animations. You have already used some very basic animations. In this chapter, you're going to learn about advanced animation techniques.</p><p>The UIKit framework provides some very powerful APIs that you can utilize in your apps to make them look great and feel more intuitive. Most of the APIs in UIKit are not very difficult to use. For instance, you can create cool animations with a small amount of code.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn about <code class="literal">UIViewPropertyAnimator</code>, a powerful object that can be used to replace the existing animations in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hello-Contacts</strong></span> app. <code class="literal">UIViewPropertyAnimator</code> provides more control over your animations than the animations you implemented in previous chapters. You'll also learn about UIKit dynamics. UIKit dynamics can be used to make objects react to their surroundings by applying physics. Finally, you'll learn how to implement a custom transition when moving from one view controller to the next.</p><p>To sum everything up, this chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">UIViewPropertyAnimator</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Vibrant animations using springs</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">UIKit dynamics</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Customizing view controller transitions
