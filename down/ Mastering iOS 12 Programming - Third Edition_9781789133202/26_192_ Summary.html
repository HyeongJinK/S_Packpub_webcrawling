To wrap everything up, you saw how to submit your app for review by Apple to release it to the App Store. Releasing an app is exciting; you don't know how well your app will perform or whether people will enjoy using it. A good beta test will help a lot, you'll be able to spot bugs or usability issues, but there's nothing like having your app in the hands of actual users.</p><p>Most developers invest a lot of time and effort into building their apps, and you are one of them. You picked up this book and went from an iOS enthusiast to an iOS master who knows exactly how to build great apps that make use of iOS' newest and greatest features. When you're ready to launch your own app into the App Store, you'll learn how exciting and nerve-racking it can be to wait for Apple to review and hopefully approve your app. Maybe you get rejected on your first try; that's possible. Don't worry too much about it; even the biggest names get rejected sometimes, and often fixing the reason isn't too complicated. Do make sure to read the App Store review guidelines before you submit; these guidelines give a pretty good indication about what you can and can't do in your apps.</p><p>Since this is the last chapter in this book, I would like to sincerely thank you for picking up this book and using it as one of the stepping stones toward becoming a master of iOS programming. I hope to have left you with the skills required to venture out on your own, read Apple's documentation, and build amazing applications. Thanks again, and if you've created something cool using this book, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to see your application.</p></div>
