If you wanted to move a couple of photos from one app on your iPad to another, you would usually have to copy and paste each photo individually. If you compare this experience with the desktop, where you can grab one or multiple items and drag those items from one place to the other, the iOS experience sounds pretty bad.</p><p>Since iOS 11, users can finally enjoy a full drag and drop experience on iOS. Implementing drag and drop in your own apps has been made surprisingly simple since all you need to do is implement a couple of required methods from a handful of protocols. This chapter's purpose is to show you how to handle drag and drop in the augmented reality gallery you built in <a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch12">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Augmented Reality</em></span>. The gallery app will be expanded so that users can add photos from their own photo library, the internet, or any other source to their art library.</p><p>This chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the drag and drop experience</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing a basic drag and drop functionality</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Customizing the drag and drop experience</li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
