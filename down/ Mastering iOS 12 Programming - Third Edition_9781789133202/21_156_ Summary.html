You saw how you can use user activities to index items that the user has already seen and how you can use searchable items to index content that the user might not have seen. You also learned how to make use of unique identifiers to ensure that you don't end up with duplicate entries in the search index. We also took a look at continuing user activities from either a user activity or a searchable item.</p><p>After you saw how <code class="literal">CoreSpotlight</code> can index your items, you learned about Universal Links and web content. It's important to think about publishing content on the web because it helps your Spotlight indexing tremendously and it enables Apple to show your Spotlight results in Safari. You also learned about the metadata that you should add to your web pages.</p><p>After all this Spotlight content, you were introduced to Universal Links. You learned how they relate to your app's web pages, and how you can use them to get bonus points in the Spotlight index and to improve the user's experience with your app.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how you can integrate your apps with iMessage through an iMessage app.</p></div>
