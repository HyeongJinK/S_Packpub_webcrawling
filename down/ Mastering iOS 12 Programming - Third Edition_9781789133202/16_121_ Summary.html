First, you learned how to handle certain predefined intents, such as sending messages by adding an <strong class="userinput"><code>Intents Extension</code></strong>. Then you implemented a custom UI for your extension to enhance the Siri experience.</p><p>Next, you learned how to enhance the user's experience by donating Siri Shortcuts. Shortcuts integrate deeply with iOS, which means that Siri picks up and shows the shortcuts added by you at the most appropriate time for the user. You also learned that users can record their own phrases for shortcuts, so they can trigger a shortcut by simply asking Siri.</p><p>The next chapter will teach you how you can integrate media like video, audio, and the camera in your app. So make sure to skip on to the next chapter when you're done playing with your Siri integration.</p></div>
