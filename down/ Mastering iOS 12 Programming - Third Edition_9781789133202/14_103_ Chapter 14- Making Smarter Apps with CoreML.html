However, it has never been easy to implement in mobile applications—that is, until Apple released the <span class="strong"><strong>CoreML</strong></span> framework as part of iOS 11. CoreML is Apple's solution to all of the problems they have run into themselves while implementing machine learning for iOS. As a result, CoreML should have the fastest, most efficient implementations for working with complex machine learning models, through an interface that is as simple and flexible as possible.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn what machine learning is, how it works, and how you can use trained machine learning models in your apps. You will also learn how you can use Apple's <span class="emphasis"><em>Vision framework</em></span> to analyze images, and you'll see how it integrates with CoreML for powerful image detection. Lastly, you'll learn how to use the new <strong class="userinput"><code>CreateML</code></strong> tool to train your own models. You will learn about these topics in the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding machine learning and CoreML</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Combining CoreML and computer vision</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Training your own models with CreateML</li></ul></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to train and use your own CoreML models to make the apps you build more intelligent and compelling.</p><p> </p></div>
