Drag and drop has limited functionality on the iPhone, but this doesn't stop it from being a powerful feature that can be used to support the dragging of contents within an application or to reorder a <code class="literal">UICollectionView</code>. Collections and tables have received special treatment because they have their own delegate methods and enable you to easily access the cell that is selected by the user for dragging.</p><p>While drag and drop might seem complicated at first glance, Apple did a great job of containing this complexity in a couple of relatively simple delegate methods that you can implement. A simple drag and drop implementation only requires you to implement fewer than a handful of methods, which is quite impressive for such a powerful feature!</p><p>In the next chapter, you will perform some extra work on the <strong class="userinput"><code>MustC</code></strong> app that you have worked on in previous chapters. You will enhance it by integrating it with iOS' powerful Spotlight search database.</p></div>
