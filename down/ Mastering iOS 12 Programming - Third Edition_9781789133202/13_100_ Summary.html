You have implemented a <code class="literal">LocationHelper</code> class that provided a simple interface for view controllers to use the location manager that is contained in the helper. You learned about the best practices in the area of asking the user for access to their location data, and you have learned that asking for a user's location is a pretty privacy-sensitive question that shouldn't be asked without a good reason.</p><p>You learned that there are different ways, each with different levels of detail, that you can use to track a user's location. You saw that you can subscribe to continuous changes, which has a bad impact on battery life. You also learned about subscribing to visits and significant location changes. In addition to learning about tracking a user's location, you also learned about monitoring whether a user has entered or exited a certain area by implementing geofencing. When you implement Core Location in your own apps, always make sure to keep the user's privacy in mind. If you don't really need the location data, then don't request access to it. And if you do, make sure to handle your user's location data with great care.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn about the CoreML framework and how you can use it to enhance your apps.</p></div>
