If this is the case, it is likely that you have used <code class="literal">UITableView</code> or <code class="literal">UITableViewController</code>. <code class="literal">UITableView</code> is a core component of many iOS applications. If an app shows a list of things, it was likely built using <code class="literal">UITableView</code>. Because<code class="literal">UITableView</code>is such an essential component on iOS, I want to make sure that we cover it right away in this book. It doesn't matter whether you have looked at<code class="literal">UITableView</code>before. This chapter will ensure that you are up to speed with the ins and outs of <code class="literal">UITableView</code> and understand how Apple has made sure that every table view scrolls with a smooth speed of 60 frames per second, which we all strive for when developing apps.</p><p>In addition to covering the basics of <code class="literal">UITableView</code>, such as how it uses delegation to obtain information about the contents it should display, you'll also learn the basics about accessing a user's data, in this case, their contacts. The application that you will end up building displays a list of the user's contacts in a table view.</p><p>Every <code class="literal">UITableView</code> uses cells to render each item it displays. In this chapter, you will create your own <code class="literal">UITableViewCell</code> that uses <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto Layout</em></span>. Auto Layout is a layout technique that is used throughout this book due to its essential part of every iOS developer's toolkit. If you haven't used <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto Layout</em></span> before, or if you haven't heard of it, that's OK. This chapter starts with the basics, and your knowledge will expand as you go through this book.</p><p>In summary, this chapter covers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring and displaying <code class="literal">UITableView</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Fetching a user's contacts through <code class="literal">Contacts.framework</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The delegate and data source of <code class="literal">UITableView</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a custom <code class="literal">UITableViewCell</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">UITableView</code> performance characteristics</li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
