The first step in doing so is usually to send out a beta version of your app so you can get feedback and gather some data about how your app is performing before you submit to the App Store and release your app to the world. Once you're satisfied with the results of your beta test, you must submit your app to Apple so they can review it before your app is released to the App Store.</p><p>In this chapter, you'll learn everything about packing up your app and submitting it to Apple's App Store Connect portal. Using App Store Connect, you can start beta-testing your app, and you can also submit it to Apple for review. App Store Connect is also used to manage your app's App Store description, keywords, promotional images, and more.
