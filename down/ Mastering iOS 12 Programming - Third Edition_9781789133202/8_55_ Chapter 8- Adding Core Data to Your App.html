You can utilize this framework whenever your application needs to store data. Simple data can often be stored in <code class="literal">UserDefaults</code>, but when you're handling data that's more complex, has relationships, or needs some form of efficient searching, Core Data is much better suited to your needs.</p><p>You don't need to build a very complex app or have vast amounts of data to make Core Data worth your while. Regardless of your app's size, even if it's tiny with only a couple of records, or if you're holding onto thousands of records, Core Data has your back.</p><p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to add Core Data to an existing app. The app you will build keeps track of a list of favorite movies for all members of a family. The main interface is a table view that shows a list of family members. If you tap on a family member, you'll see their favorite movies. Adding family members can be done through the overview screen, and adding movies can be done through the detail screen.</p><p><span>You won't</span> build the screens in this app from scratch. The code bundle for this chapter includes a starter project called <span class="strong"><strong>MustC</strong></span>. The starter project contains all of the screens, so you don't have set up the user interface before you get around to implementing Core Data.</p><p>In this chapter, the following topics are covered:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the Core Data <span>Stack</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding Core Data to an application</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Modeling data in the model editor</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Storing and querying data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Using multiple managed object contexts</li></ul></div></div>
