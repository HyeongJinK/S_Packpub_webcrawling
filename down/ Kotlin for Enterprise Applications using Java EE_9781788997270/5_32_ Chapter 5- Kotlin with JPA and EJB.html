Almost all businesses are data driven. Persisting this data, retrieving it, and processing it in order to make business decisions are common activities in an enterprise application:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788997270/graphics/c6560434-6bd2-49bb-94f6-567e54068a5f.png" /></div><p>The component that deals with data persistence and data retrieval is <span>popularly</span><a id="id326454776" class="indexterm"></a> known as the <span class="strong"><strong>object-relational mapping</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ORM</strong></span>) component. Persistence frameworks also offer ORM layers of abstraction between the application and the database. The persistence framework is responsible for converting the state of objects to entities, persisting them to a relational database, and retrieving them for processing purposes.</p><p>Java EE has an API that can be used in the ORM component of an application. This is called the <span class="strong"><strong>Java Persistence API</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JPA</strong></span>).
