The application is designed in small pieces, each handling a single business responsibility. Microservices is an architectural style in which a large complex <span>application</span><a id="id326174212" class="indexterm"></a> is composed of multiple, smaller services:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788997270/graphics/f81439a6-741d-42a8-ac57-ec069b014c7a.png" /></div><p>This style loosely couples the system being developed and each service can be developed independently. With Kotlin, it is much easier to write the microservices in order to experience the benefits of this architectural style of developing software.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Microservices and their architecture</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Breaking a monolith application into smaller microservices</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The benefits of the microservices architecture style</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to test microservices</li></ul></div></div>
