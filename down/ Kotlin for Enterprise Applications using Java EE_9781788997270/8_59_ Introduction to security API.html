The security API version 1.0 is a reference implementation of JSR 375, the Java EE Security API specification. This specification is aimed at simplifying and supporting new security aspects for platform services, standardizing the way that we secure applications. The security API is annotation-driven and uses a lot of CDI and <span class="strong"><strong>Expression Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>EL</strong></span>) to make the <span>implementation</span><a id="id326014288" class="indexterm"></a> easier.</p><p>The key features of the security API <span>implementation</span><a id="id326435682" class="indexterm"></a> include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">IdentityStore</code> mechanism</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">SecurityContext</code> interface</li></ul></div><p><code class="literal">IdentityStore</code> provides an implementation for storing user details, but other implementations are also out there, such as an embedded store, a database store, and the LDAP implementation.</p><p>The authentication mechanism is a way of validating the user details provided against <code class="literal">IdentityStore</code>. The <code class="literal">SecurityContext</code> interface is geared toward a <span>programmatic</span><a id="id325442819" class="indexterm"></a> way of granting or denying access (authorization) to the resources. There is also a hashing mechanism provided in the specification that can be used for securing passwords, as well as other sensitive information.</p><p>We will take a look at some of these points and illustrate them using examples in the further sections of this chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"></a>Note</h3><p>The Java EE Security (JSR 375) reference implementation is named Soteria and is currently maintained by the Eclipse-ee4j community.</p></div></div>
