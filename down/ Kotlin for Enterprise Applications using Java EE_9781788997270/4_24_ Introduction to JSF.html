It is the primary web framework in Java EE and includes the MVC model and the template framework.</p><p>It aims to simplify the frontend aspect of Java Enterprise applications and accelerate user interface development. It uses a component-based model to build the user interface. It defines a UI component model, which is bound to a well-defined<span>request</span><a id="id326576652" class="indexterm"></a>processing model, a<span class="strong"><strong>POJO</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Plain Old Java Object</strong></span>), in an enterprise application. This allows JSP custom librariesto handle those UI components and provides a mechanism to extend the standard UI components.</p><p>JSF saves the state information of the UI components and repopulates them during the display, since the state of the components lives beyond the lifespan of the HTTP request.</p><p>JSF operates by providing functionalities such as data conversion and component rendering. JSF doesn't change the basic page life cycle, in which a client makes an HTTP request and the server responds with a dynamically generated HTML page.</p><p>JSF is a standard framework for building presentation tiers for web applications. It provides a set of presentations and user interface components. It also provides an event model for wiring the interactions between the UI and the application objects.</p><p>Using JSF, we can build reusable components with Facelets. We can also use standard APIs, such as Bean validation, CDIs, and tag libraries.</p><p>JSF also supports HTML 5 and Ajax calls. It additionally has Faces Flow, which allows us to create business workflows, wizards, and sets of pages.</p></div>
