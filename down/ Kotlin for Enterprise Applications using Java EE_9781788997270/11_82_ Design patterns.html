These are solutions to design problems that are common in the course of software design, unleashing the profundity of experiences to solve common problems of software development. The aim here is to use patterns to solve these problems in a more structured and elegant manner.</p><p>Software design or application design tends to change over the time. Any system has to be flexible for any change in the code. A change in the requirements, a new feature request, a defect fix, or a refactoring may require us to restructure the code. When a new piece of code is developed, it has to be gently integrated into the system. Existing code can be refactored without breaking the other working parts of the system. Any code change should not result in changing the code all over the system, so the software system has to be designed to handle the change and the impact on the code has to be minimized.</p><p>Design patterns help overcome some of the challenges that we face when designing a solution.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec76"></a>Advantages of design patterns</h3></div></div></div><p>Patterns are well-tested <span>solutions</span><a id="id326285740" class="indexterm"></a> for common design problems and these address some of the concerns of how systems tend to evolve. Instead of starting from scratch, a proven pattern can be used to solve problems. These patterns are well-tested approaches and are already optimized and proven to work for these common design problems. If we need to improve the existing solution further in our application, we can do that as well. This will improve the software development life cycle.</p><p>Furthermore, these patterns support the reusability of solutions in different places within the system, providing transparent design solutions when designing an application.</p><p>Design patterns are not solutions for any domain-specific problems. Instead, they are the solution to common problems that are present in the design of software systems. Design patterns are a set of best practices that provide templates to address commonly occurring software-design problems. This provides a pattern that, when applied to these known problems, will save time, organize programming elements, and improve the architecture of the software. When these patterns are applied to any software application, it makes it more flexible, more maintainable, and more resilient.</p><p>Identifying the problem is important, but so is choosing the correct pattern to solve it. So, gaining an understanding of these patterns will give you an idea of what problems they can solve.</p><p>In the upcoming sections, we will discuss some patterns that are most commonly used to design enterprise applications.</p></div></div>
