These <span>patterns</span><a id="id326286124" class="indexterm"></a> aim to reduce complexity in creating objects and allowing the instantiation of objects in a controlled way, thus providing flexibility in the way that objects are created and represented in the system.</p><p>These patterns enforce constraints for object creation, such as the number of instances that can be created in an application. This encourages the idea of coding to interfaces in which objects can be instantiated without knowledge of the specific implementation classes. It also reduces the tight coupling of objects within the system. The instantiation of objects will not be coupled directly into the code, but will be done in a way that can reduce complexity when we have to change from one implementation to another.</p><p>Patterns such as Factory, Builder, Singleton, and Prototype come under the category of creational patterns.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec78"></a>Structural patterns</h3></div></div></div><p>Structural patterns focus on <span>representing</span><a id="id325857677" class="indexterm"></a> the relationship <span>between</span><a id="id325442812" class="indexterm"></a> objects. This includes looking at how classes can be composed to form a complex structure, thus providing a simple and efficient way to define class hierarchies and the relationships between objects.</p><p>Patterns such as Adapter, Decorator, Façade, Bridge, and Proxy come under the structural patterns category.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec79"></a>Behavioral patterns</h3></div></div></div><p>These patterns provide a <span>means</span><a id="id325442827" class="indexterm"></a> by which common <span>communication</span><a id="id325601659" class="indexterm"></a> patterns can be identified between objects.
