<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="ch09lvl1sec66"></a>Introduction to microservices</h2></div></div><hr /></div><p>Microservices is a software <span>methodology</span><a id="id326572352" class="indexterm"></a> for designing and developing software. It is an architectural style that structures an application to be composed of multiple smaller services. Each service exposes its operation via well-defined interfaces and is responsible for a single business requirement.</p><p>These services are independent of each other and this style of architecture consequently makes the application a collection of loosely-coupled services. The concept of microservices is aimed at developing an application that is loosely coupled, easily scalable, easily testable, and delivers the piece of software in a shorter interval of time.</p><p>Different microservices work together to form a larger application as a whole. They also communicate via unified, standard, well-defined interfaces.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"></a>Note</h3><p>Like the REST principles, the microservices architecture is a way of designing the enterprise software. There are no hard and fast rules defined for this architectural principle. Its main motive is to sufficiently decompose the application in order to facilitate application development and deployment in agile fashion, and they must also be easily testable and scalable.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>microservices architecture</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MSA</strong></span>) is <span>designed</span><a id="id325442812" class="indexterm"></a> to separate the application into small, independent services, each one performing a specific functionality. These services are stateless and communicate with each other over the REST, regardless of the underlying platform it is developed in. The services are highly resilient, which means services are designed to be easily recoverable, which assume a high load or a failure. </p><p>Microservices has proven to be the capable model for developing a loosely-coupled system that is scalable, easily testable, and reduces the development cycle compared to single, large <span>monolith</span><a id="id325442822" class="indexterm"></a> applications. With Kotlin, it is much easier to develop such services and maintain such code bases.</p><p>To design microservices, we need to identify and design small services, each service performing one specific task. These smaller services form the building blocks of the microservices. For them to communicate, we need to define and choose the interface types so that the consuming service won't be tightly coupled to the other services. In addition, when interfaces are used, these services can be developed simultaneously; the services don't have to worry about the other service implementations, and they can have an independent life cycle from development up until deployment.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec64"></a>Advantages of microservices</h3></div></div></div><p>Some of the advantages of <span>microservices</span><a id="id325601664" class="indexterm"></a> are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">As each service focuses on one responsibility, the code becomes clearer, easier to test, and has a more controlled flow.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Services can be independently deployable by an automated deployment process.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Unlike monolith services, it doesn't suffer from the single point of failure. All the services are deployed separately and talk to different data stores.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Any change or upgrade can be easier with microservices. Unlike the monolith, making an upgrade won't results in downtime for the system as a whole. Only the required system will be upgraded.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">We can have smaller code bases with the microservices, and maintaining such code bases becomes easier. </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">When it comes to scalability, the service that is getting more requests can be scaled easily, leading to better resource utilization and better system performance. </li></ul></div><p></p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"></a>Note</h3><p>The microservices style of architecture may not be employed for every use case. Although it offers several advantages, it also has some side-effects. If the number of smaller services increases, d<span>eploying and managing can be overhead sometimes</span>. Communication between services might contribute to the latency.</p></div></div></div>
