Using the <code class="literal">spatstat</code> package of R, we have learned how to create a <code class="literal">ppp</code> object both with and without marks by importing a CSV file. Using density, we can easily visualize these points. After that, we saw how to use the quadrat test for checking CSR in a point pattern process. For checking clustering, we learned about three more functions: G, K, and L. We can test the null hypothesis of CSR using maximum absolute deviation and the sum of the squared distance between different simulated functions. We also learned how to use the <code class="literal">spatialkernel</code> package of R for spatial segregation of bivariate marked point pattern data. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to use geostatistics using different functionalities of R.</p></div>
