We have learned the basics of classification and the implementation details of this in QGIS using the SCP. We have used landsat images and a CIR image to do so. Land cover classification is a very useful technique to know and it must be remembered that we have used only one type of band combination for classification; there are many other band combinations of landsat that can generate useful results for different objectives, such as studying urban areas or vegetation study. In the next chapter, we will use both QGIS and R for landslide susceptibility mapping using the knowledge and skill we have gained so far.</p></div>
