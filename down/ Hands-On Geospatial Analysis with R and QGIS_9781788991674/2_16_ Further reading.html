We will cover other data manipulation techniques as we step on through new chapters. But if you want to have a more in-depth discussion about these topics, you can have a look at the book <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning R for Geospatial Analysis</em></span> by Michael Dorman and <span class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping</em></span> by Brunsdon and Comber. For QGIS, if you want better coverage of visualizing and stylizing vector data, <span class="emphasis"><em>QGIS by Example</em></span> by Bruy and Svidzinska and <span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering QGIS</em></span> by Menke et al. are two great reads.</p></div>
