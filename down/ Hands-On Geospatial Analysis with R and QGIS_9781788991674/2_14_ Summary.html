We learned to import point data from an Excel file and how to plot it on a map in R. We used the <code class="literal">ggmap</code> package of R to accomplish this task along with various options for plotting these. The <code class="literal">sp</code> package of R has six main classes for dealing with spatial data: <code class="literal">SpatialPoints</code>, <code class="literal">SpatialPointsDataFrame</code>, <code class="literal">SpatialLines</code>, <code class="literal">SpatialLinesDataFrame</code>, <code class="literal">SpatialPolygons</code>, and <code class="literal">SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code>. We learned to use the <code class="literal">readOGR()</code> function of the <code class="literal">sp</code> package for importing shapefiles containing different vector classes. In this chapter, we also learned to visualize quantitative and qualitative data in R.</p><p>We also learned how to use QGIS for vector data importation and how to visualize those. Importing Excel files to QGIS was also discussed, along with visualizing quantitative and qualitative data. Further, adding text diagrams and adding OSM as background maps was also discussed. This naturally leads to the next topic, which is creating and editing data and that will be discussed in the next two chapters.</p></div>
