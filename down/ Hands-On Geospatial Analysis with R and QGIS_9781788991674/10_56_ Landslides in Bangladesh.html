Landslides mainly occur in the southeastern part of Bangladesh, which is also called the <span class="strong"><strong>Chittagong Hill Tracts</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CHT</strong></span>). Landslides mainly occur in monsoon time, and are primarily due to factors such as cutting hills, high slopes, certain degrees of elevation <span>from</span><a id="id325744726" class="indexterm"></a> the sea level, and slope saturation. As people also live in these hilly areas, landslides can be incredibly deadly, as was the case in 2017, when many people died due to multiple landslide events. As such, it is important that we have the ability to model and predict the highly susceptible zones so <span>that</span><a id="id325744732" class="indexterm"></a> lives can be <span>saved</span><a id="id325744739" class="indexterm"></a> and injuries can be prevented.</p><p> </p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Institute of Remote Sensing, Jahangirnagar University</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IRS-JU</strong></span>), arranged a field trip to the CHT in November 2017 and took different measures from past landslide locations:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788991674/graphics/e3175160-9dde-4334-834e-252524d11271.png" /></div><p>Here we see a raster screenshot of the CHT along with the point locations of the landslide events investigated by IRS-JU. Now, we will use both QGIS and R to make a landslide susceptibility map.</p></div>
