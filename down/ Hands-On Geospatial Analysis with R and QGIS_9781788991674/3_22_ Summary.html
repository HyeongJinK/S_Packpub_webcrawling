In doing so, this chapter showed how we can create point, line, and polygon data. Furthermore, it also covered how we can populate different features with attribute values and how we can use the Georeferencer plugin to digitize an image. We ended the chapter by learning how to create spatial databases and how to import shapefiles into them. We've covered just enough to proceed to the next chapters, where we will delve deep into different spatial operations, spatial analysis, and more.Â We haven't talked in detail about spatial databases and many other operations that could be performed using spatial databases. But the topics covered so far should have equipped you with sufficient resources to dig deeper and, in later chapters, to start applying machine learning models in spatial research cases.</p></div>
