We'll learn how to merge shapefiles and clip our data to a vector file, differences between shapefiles, how to get the intersection of point data and line data, and how to create a buffer around a feature. We'll use R and QGIS to demonstrate these operations and you'll find out that, for some of these operations, R is more convenient than QGIS, and vice versa. All of these techniques are very helpful to have in a geospatial analyst's toolbox. </p><p>After completing this chapter, you'll have hands-on knowledge of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Combining shapefiles</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Clipping points to the boundary of a shapefile</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Difference</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Intersection between two vector files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating buffers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Calculating the area of polygons</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Converting vector data types</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating statistical summaries of vector files</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Advanced field calculations</li></ul></div></div>
