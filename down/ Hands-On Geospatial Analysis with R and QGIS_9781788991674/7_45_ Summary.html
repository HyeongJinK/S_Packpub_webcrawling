We also learned how to model autocorrelation using a SAR model. This was followed by modeling count data using a Poisson GLM. After that, we learned the basics of geostatistics, with variograms and kriging, in particular. Then, we learned how to understand the degree of spatial dependence in a random field using variograms. We learned about the different ways of plotting and modeling spatial dependence using the <code class="literal">geoR</code> and <code class="literal">gstat</code> packages. We then learned how to predict or interpolate data from covariograms using a method called kriging, and we learned how to compute exceedance probability and looked at checking the residuals of a prediction.</p><p>In the upcoming chapters, we'll learn how to automate different spatial processing and analysis tasks. We'll then learn how to use the power of QGIS inside R and vice versa. Finally, we'll learn how to fit machine learning models to create a landslide susceptibility model and corresponding map using real data from Bangladesh. </p></div>
