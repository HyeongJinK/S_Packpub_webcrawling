We started with the installation of R, following which we also saw the various data types in R and how to work with these in R. Later in this chapter, we studied the programming aspects of R and also learned to use and apply loops and functions. Additionally, we saw how to visualize data in R using the <code class="literal">ggplot2</code> package. Finally, we also learned about installing QGIS and also plugins, and we briefly studied the QGIS desktop.</p><p> </p><p>We have only just scratched the surface of the many functionalities of R and QGIS. We have yet to touch upon working with spatial data, creating a spatial database, conducting spatial data analysis, and so on, which we will be introducing in Chapter 2, <span class="emphasis"><em>Fundamentals of GIS Using R and QGIS</em></span>. Working with spatial data in R and QGIS requires us to know about the basics of GIS and how spatial data is being handled by R and QGIS, which we will be discussing in detail in Chapter 2. So, let's jump in!</p></div>
