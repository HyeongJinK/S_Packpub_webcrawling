Point pattern analysis allows us to conduct different statistical analyses on point data. In previous chapters, we learned different ways to manage spatial data—both vector and raster data. This chapter looks at how to conduct statistics-related tasks, such as testing for spatial randomness, spatial logistic regression, and analysis of dependence. In many cases, we might need to draw inferences from our data; using point pattern analysis, we can answer all such queries. This chapter will solely focus on using the <code class="literal">spatstat</code> package with R only.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to point pattern analysis</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Analysis of point patterns</li></ul></div></div>
