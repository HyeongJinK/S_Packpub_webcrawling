This can be done in two ways: supervised and unsupervised. <span class="strong"><strong>Supervised classification</strong></span> refers to a <span>situation</span><a id="id325302985" class="indexterm"></a> where we create a training area and generate a signature area from the training area, and then use that to classify a raster. In <span class="strong"><strong>unsupervised classification</strong></span>, the user determines into how many clusters they want to <span>divide</span><a id="id325536954" class="indexterm"></a> the data beforehand, and then the image is classified into that number of clusters; finally, the user then identifies the relevant land classes for the clusters.</p></div>
