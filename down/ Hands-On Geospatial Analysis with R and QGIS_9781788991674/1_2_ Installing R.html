Graphics in R <span>are</span><a id="id325753644" class="indexterm"></a> of very <span>high</span><a id="id325756075" class="indexterm"></a> quality, and, although it <span>was</span><a id="id325756082" class="indexterm"></a> not primarily developed for GIS purposes, with the development of packages such as <span class="strong"><strong>ggmap</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>tmap</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>sf</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>raster</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>sp</strong></span>, and so on, R can work as a GIS environment itself. Furthermore, R codes can be written inside QGIS and we <span>can</span><a id="id325756109" class="indexterm"></a> also <span>work</span><a id="id325756116" class="indexterm"></a> on QGIS inside R using the <span class="strong"><strong>RQGIS</strong></span> package.</p><p>We will now install R with the help of snapshots of <span>each</span><a id="id325756183" class="indexterm"></a> of the step-by-step instructions provided. The following steps have been implemented in Microsoft Windows and should also be applicable to Mac or other platforms with a little tweaking. There are no specific requirements for computer configuration, but any modern desktop or laptop will be sufficient to run the examples provided in this book.</p><p>Download R <span>software</span><a id="id325756192" class="indexterm"></a> from the following site and click on <strong class="userinput"><code>download R</code></strong>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">https://www.r-project.org/.</a></p><p>Now we need to select a CRAN mirror; we will use the first link to download R.</p><p>Now we will need to click on <strong class="userinput"><code>Download R for Windows</code></strong>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788991674/graphics/3156d5b8-daf9-4152-b1da-02d13c3d5db9.png" /></div><p>Click <strong class="userinput"><code>install R for the first time</code></strong>, as we can see from the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788991674/graphics/f5fc7e27-5d03-4277-b8f2-431d2078e9b3.png" /></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now we just need to double-click the <code class="literal">.exe</code> file that we have downloaded and continue to click to accept all the defaults to complete the download of R. After we have installed R, we <span>need</span><a id="id325759252" class="indexterm"></a> to open it, and it will look similar to the following screenshot. For this installation process, a 64-bit computer is being used, but if you are using a 32-bit computer, your R windows will reflect that:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781788991674/graphics/c6918d5d-5299-49e1-81b1-b3b13d01c1a4.jpg" /></div><p>We are finally ready to rock and roll using R. But before that, we need a little bit more familiarity with R, or perhaps we need a refresher.</p><p> </p></div>
