The things we have learned here will work as the cornerstone for doing complicated raster analysis tasks, such as applying machine learning algorithms, as we'll be discussing in later chapters. We learned how to read and load raster data using the <code class="literal">raster()</code> function from the <code class="literal">raster</code> package in R. For multispectral images, such as Landsat images, we have learned how to use <code class="literal">stack()</code> and how to use <code class="literal">plotRGB()</code> for false color composite, which gives us colored images. Using the <code class="literal">terrain()</code> function with different arguments, such as <code class="literal">slope</code> and <code class="literal">aspect</code>, we can derive the slope and aspect from DEM data. We can use the <code class="literal">hillShade()</code> function to generate hillshade in R. Furthermore, if we want to do raster computation, we can just load different bands as variables and then compute these different raster calculations as we have done to calculate the NDVI. In QGIS, we learned how to do almost all of these functionalities. Additionally, we also have learned how to create mosaics of rasters, clip raster data by mask layer, and sample raster data using points. </p><p>So far, we have learned how to do basic raster calculations, and so we are now ready to delve deeper. In the next chapter, we'll look at how to do some advanced vector and raster analysis in R and QGIS. We'll look at how to integrate R and QGIS in another chapter.</p></div>
