So far, we have covered vector data, and this chapter will focus on raster data manipulation and analysis. We'll learn how to use raster data provided by different satellites and how to get meaningful information from this data. Going over reading raster data; changing its projection; and visualizing multispectral images to computing slope, aspect, hillshade, and clipping, we'll cover a lot in this chapter, using both R and QGIS. We'll also cover reclassifying rasters, masking raster by a vector layer, and so on.</p><p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Basics of remote sensing</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with raster data in R</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with raster data in QGIS</li></ul></div></div>
