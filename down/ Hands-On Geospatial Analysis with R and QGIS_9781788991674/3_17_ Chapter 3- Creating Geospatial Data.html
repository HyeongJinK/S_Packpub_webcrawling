We've learned the basics of GIS and vector data, how R and QGIS store them, and more. This chapter will introduce you to the creation of data and the editing functionalities of spatial data offered by R and QGIS. We'll be introduced to different data sources and how to download data from one of these sites. Often, we need to create a digitized map from a printed map, and we'll be covering that in this chapter. After this, we'll learn how to create point, line, and polygon data using QGIS. We'll then learn how to add features to a shapefile and how to create and use a spatial database. These skills will enable us to work more efficiently with spatial data.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Getting data from the web</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating vector data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Digitizing a map</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Working with databases</li></ul></div></div>
