The clients and the servers on the distributed system can access these files and run their processes smoothly.</p><p>Let's see how we can install ZooKeeper in our Mesos framework:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>Run this command to install ZooKeeper:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>sudo yum install mesosphere-zookeeper</strong></span></pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="2" type="1"><li>You will see that the ZooKeeper package is found. We will be installing the ZooKeeper version 3.4.6. Enter <code class="literal">Y</code> for yes.
</li></ol></div><p>This will automatically install all the <span>dependencies</span><a id="id325485916" class="indexterm"></a> that ZooKeeper requires to run. Simple, isn't it?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li>After all the packages are downloaded, you should see the following:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789137385/graphics/fd44f6ff-0539-4998-a8a2-55b93f5922d7.png" /></div><p> </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="4" type="1"><li>Let's now check the ZooKeeper services with the following command:</li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>service zookeeper status</strong></span></pre><p>You will again see the status as inactive, but this is nothing to worry about—we will be starting the services later, after performing all the configurations.</p><p>To continue, install ZooKeeper on all the masters. We won't <span>bother</span><a id="id325489683" class="indexterm"></a> installing ZooKeeper on slaves, as when we install it for the master, it gets installed for slaves automatically.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip5"></a>Note</h3><p>To save time, you can use the <code class="literal">history</code> command <span>to grab previous commands used</span>, and then paste them on other servers.
You can also run the install command as <code class="literal">sudo yum -y install mesos</code>, which will eliminate the need to say yes every time the process is set to ask. With this command, it will automatically consider those instances as agreed to, and continue the installation without needing your intervention.</p></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>You will notice that installation will be simple for the servers, as we added the repository previously. And with that, we have now installed the masters and slaves. Let's now move on to installing Marathon.</p></div>
