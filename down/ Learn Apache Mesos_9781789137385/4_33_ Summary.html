We have seen how Mesos handles failures, and during upgrades, how you can move all of your tasks to another server.</p><p>In this chapter, we covered the most important aspects for configuring Mesosphere. Let's quickly wrap up this chapter and see what we have learned. We learned how to configure ZooKeeper connection information for Mesos. We worked on ZoopKeeper and worked on Mesos configuration on master server. We then set up a rule to allow communication between subnets in AWS. Then, we tested higher availability for Mesos and Marathon services. We also saw how it is useful in high availability mode, as there is no downtime.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will see how to deploy services using Marathon on the Mesosphere cluster.</p></div>
