But now, as we have to develop a production environment, we will have to add more components. Accordingly, our plan of action <span>includes</span><a id="id325245083" class="indexterm"></a> the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding one Marathon server</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding two more master servers</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Adding three slave servers</li></ul></div><p> </p><p>This will cause our architecture to look like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789137385/graphics/edfe015c-50ef-4160-8e14-9dcbaf0dfaca.png" /></div><p>The packages that we will need to install on each of the components should be evident from the architecture shown in the above diagram. For Marathon servers, we will need to install the Marathon package; for Masters, we will install ZooKeeper; and on the slaves, we will install Docker, which is a <span>container</span><a id="id325482953" class="indexterm"></a> that will enable our applications to run. This is how we will be distributing our package installation to make a multi-node cluster. In this chapter, we won't talk in details about these packages; instead, we will focus on creating and removing nodes from the cluster. We will, however, touch upon the installation of the mesos-master and slave, ZooKeeper, Marathon, and Docker.</p></div>
