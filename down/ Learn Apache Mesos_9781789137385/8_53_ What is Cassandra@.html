It is designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers. It provides high availability, with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple data centers, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operation for all clients. It is extremely fault-tolerant because of its built-in replication features. It is also highly performant, decentralized, and most importantly, it's extremely durable for companies that cannot afford to lose any data.</p><p>Any distributed persistent application including Cassandra can have challenges. Let's understand few of those challenges that we face: complexity of installation; data movement expense and manual processes with node failures; performance limited by direct attached storage.</p><p>Before we begin our demo, let's first understand how Cassandra overcomes these challenges through running inside the Docker. That is we will be running Cassandra inside Docker, and then the Docker containers will be deployed on top of Mesos cluster, which means we are going to deploy Apache Cassandra image via Marathon; and using Marathon, it will get deployed on your Mesos cluster. It will leverage an external storage platform for its persistent data. We will be using REX-Ray and EBS volume. REX-Ray is a volume driver that will connect with your external storage. We are going to use AWS EBS for our persistent data. If by any chance our server goes down or if our Docker container crashes, it will automatically get started on any other server, and the same persistent data will get attached automatically, using your REX-Ray volume driver.</p><p>So, let's quickly go ahead and perform some activity on how to deploy Apache Cassandra on your Mesos cluster via Marathon.</p></div>
