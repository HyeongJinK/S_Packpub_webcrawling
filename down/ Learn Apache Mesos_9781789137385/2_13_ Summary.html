We also created a route table so traffic can flow between them, then we created an internet gateway to give internet access to our instances. We learned how to create an EC2 instance inside our VPC and subnet. We created multiple instances and different subnets to achieve high availability and reliability.</p><p>You also saw that you can connect to an EC2 instance in two ways: by using PuTTY, or by converting them into a PPK file and using PuTTY to connect to your instances and next using SSH. If you have Apache, you can use SSH to connect to your instances.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will see how to install Mesos and our required components on all these servers.</p></div>
