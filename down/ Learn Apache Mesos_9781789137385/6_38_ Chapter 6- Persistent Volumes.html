This avails you with lot of benefits, from isolating a task from the other running tasks for avoiding any conflicts between them to controlling the overall task's resource usage programmatically.<span></span></p><p>Here, we will understand what the containerizer is. This section briefly introduces the concept of containers, and also provides a detailed overview of the following different containerization options in Mesos:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Contain tasks to run in a limited-resource runtime environment</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Control a task's resource usage, such as CPU and memory, programmatically</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Run software in the prepackaged filesystem image, allowing it to run in different environments</li></ul></div><p>Let's understand the different types of containers and containerizers that we have. Mesos implements the following containerizers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Composing</strong></span>: This feature <span>helps in multiple container technology in one shot</span>. When you configure the <code class="literal">--containerizers</code> agent flag with the multiple comma-separated containerizer name, this container is enabled in our environment. So, let's quickly see our configuration file in which we have enabled the containerizers. You need to go inside the slave server by navigating to the <code class="literal">cd /etc/mesos</code> file to enable your containerizer technology. Here we have enabled Mesos and Docker, which play together to run the containers.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Docker</strong></span>: This is one of the most popular <span>technology</span><a id="id325485909" class="indexterm"></a> containerizers and it allows <span>tasks</span><a id="id325485917" class="indexterm"></a> to run inside a Docker container, which is enabled by configuring the agent flag as <code class="literal">--containerizers=docker</code>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Mesos</strong></span>: This native <span>containerizer</span><a id="id325485934" class="indexterm"></a> allows tasks to be run with an array of pluggable <span>isolaters</span><a id="id325490074" class="indexterm"></a> provided by Mesos, and is enabled on configuring the agent flag as <code class="literal">--containerizers=mesos</code>.</li></ul></div><p> </p><p>Later, you will see how to run the container images to run the container in our slave servers using the Marathon framework to schedule and execute the containers on the slave server with the help of Mesos cluster, which manages all our containers. I hope this will help you to deploy containers in your environment. Before we go ahead with containerizer, we will be learning about the advantages and limitations of persistent volumes. We will also be creating a demo to know more about persistent volumes using EBS persistent volumes in AWS.</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What is persistent volumes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The need for persistent volumes</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to use persistent volumes using Docker</li></ul></div></div>
