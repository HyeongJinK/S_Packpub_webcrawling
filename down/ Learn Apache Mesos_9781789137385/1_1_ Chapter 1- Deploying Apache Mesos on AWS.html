This is because these applications are accessed by a large number of users. Also, different types of applications means different platforms, such as Java and .NET. </p><p>Apache Mesos is a concentrated fault-tolerant cluster-management tool that is used for distributed computing environments that provides resource-isolation and management across a cluster of slave nodes. It efficiently manages the CPU memory and disk resources across the cluster, schedules the resources according to requirements, and deploys the apps. It is a highly available master through Apache ZooKeeper.</p><p>Apart from this, Apache Mesos also provides features such as application scheduling, scaling, faulttolerance, and cellfilling. It also supplies an application service discovery tool. </p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Installation and configuration of a highly available cluster in Apache Mesos</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting the failure configuration in case the master nodes go down</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up a Mesos slave server to handle the Docker-related tasks, which are scheduled by Marathon</li></ul></div><p> </p></div>
