We then installed Mesos on our three master servers, and we installed slaves on all three slave servers. We added the Mesosphere repository, and then installed Mesos. Following that, we installed ZooKeeper on all our master servers, along with installing Marathon and Docker. We also saw how you can quickly start and stop the Mesosphere services and validate their <span>status.</span></p><p>We also studied how to set up a multi-node Mesos cluster. We revised the package installation for respective servers and learned how to configure a mesos-master and Marathon server, and also adding slaves. So, basically, we are now well-equipped with the knowledge of setting up a muti-cluster mesos environment.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn about Mesos administration in detail by understanding how to schedule and allocate resources, along with an understanding of fault tolerance and high availability.</p></div>
