We learned how to enable authenticators, and configure our masters and agents with secrets and credentials so that they can build trust relationships. We saw how we can easily add a self-signed SSL certificate to Marathon and secure all our communications. In the next chapter, we will be learning about Marathon-lb and how to deploy the Apache web server and Cassandra server.</p></div>
