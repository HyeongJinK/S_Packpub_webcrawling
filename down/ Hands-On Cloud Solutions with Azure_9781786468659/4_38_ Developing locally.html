Some will require external installs for debugging to work fully. Let's review debugging in <span>Visual</span><a id="id324953569" class="indexterm"></a> Studio for those who are unfamiliar with it. Once you open Visual Studio and create a project, you will see a debug button and a debug file menu. One caveat is that you should make sure that you have the right startup project selected, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/69e2c807-842a-488d-916b-af5b36185ce5.png" /></div><p>This will give you the ability to set your code with breakpoints and see what is happening. For most web applications, you can test locally, as you normally would before you deploy. I generally tend to use Docker containers to run things locally, such as testing or adding a .NET Core App to Docker. There are also some emulators to help with local development. Let's start by installing Docker locally; I would make sure that you are running Hyper-V locally or Docker will install VirtualBox as the management resource. Before you install, review the documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/.</a>. I use Docker to install things such as MongoDB, CosmosDB, and so on.</p><p>The other things I install (optional) are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">CosmosDB: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator</a></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Azure Functions Runtime: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-runtime-overview" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-runtime-overview</a></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Azure Logic Apps: <a class="ulink" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VinaySinghMSFT.AzureLogicAppsToolsforVisualStudio-18551" target="_blank">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VinaySinghMSFT.AzureLogicAppsToolsforVisualStudio-18551</a></li></ul></div><p>This is my shortlist of extras, and as we begin to go through development, I will point out other things that I like to use to make things easier. You can install extensions through the Extension and Updates Manager that can be helpful for development, but this down to personal choice. The following screenshot shows how you would add extensions to help with development:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/ecfb6194-a01c-4cb3-b16c-bf43d00ddc0c.png" /></div><p>There are a lot of great extensions to use that are based on your project type. It’s always good to experiment with what works for you. You can also, if you have a development subscription, deploy POCs to Azure. I like to call this my Azure Dev environment. It can <span>help</span><a id="id325433852" class="indexterm"></a> me work out issues that I may not see locally. You can do this by right-clicking on the resource you wish to publish and selecting the following instruction from the publish screen, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/46060aaa-b1c5-438d-8253-4d776d5b309c.png" /></div><p>So, as you can see, your development experience can be leveraged greatly and can help you to deliver the solutions you need in Azure.</p></div>
