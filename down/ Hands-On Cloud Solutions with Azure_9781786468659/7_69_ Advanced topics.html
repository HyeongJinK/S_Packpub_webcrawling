You use App Service Environments or ASE/Isolated App Services if you have GDFR or PII data requirements. Also, ensure you use TDE in your <span>data</span><a id="id324953569" class="indexterm"></a> stores out the gate to help protect your data. If you are developing mobile applications, I would use Xarmarin, as writing in C# and deploying to all platforms is pretty sweet. </p><p> </p><p>At the time of writing this book, some new features in Azure became available that I would like to discuss. The first one is <span class="strong"><strong>Azure Front Door</strong></span> and the second one is <span class="strong"><strong>Azure confidential computing</strong></span>. Let's take a look at what these have to offer.</p><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec41"></a>What is Azure Front Door?</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Azure Front Door</strong></span> is a layer 7 or HTTP/HTTPS layer anycast protocol. It was designed to define, manage, and monitor global traffic routing in high availability global (multi-regional) scenarios. It helps accelerate your application performance <span>by</span><a id="id324953620" class="indexterm"></a> using a TCP-based <code class="literal">anycast</code> protocol that connects a site user to the nearest <span class="strong"><strong>Point of Presence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>POP</strong></span>), in order to improve application performance. It assists with smart health probes to monitor backend latency <span>and</span><a id="id325433778" class="indexterm"></a> availability, providing automatic failover if the backend goes down. This can also be used in maintenance scenarios. It also assists with URL routing and multi-site hosting, as well as SSL off-loading. This is key for me as it solved the App Service Cert issues with the subscription boundaries. Azure Front Door is a premium service and comes at a price. I have not had a chance at the time writing of writing this book to use it in a production environment but thought I would share what I have learned so far, but you can learn more at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview</a>. This, like all other services, I would use when needed, especially if you need global distribution.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec42"></a>What is Azure confidential computing?</h3></div></div></div><p>I wanted to take some <span>time</span><a id="id325433795" class="indexterm"></a> to mention a cloud-first data initiative that I have not had the pleasure of working with yet. The Azure confidential computing efforts have <span>led</span><a id="id325433833" class="indexterm"></a> to the creation of <span class="strong"><strong>Trusted Execution Environments</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TEEs</strong></span>). These are containers that protect the data from being accessible from an outside source. Microsoft <span>worked</span><a id="id325433848" class="indexterm"></a> at following these principles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Migration of top data breach threats</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The customer is in full control of data, rest, transit, or use</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The code runs in a verified/protected environment</li></ul></div><p>This also allows customers to share and use AI against data to reach better conclusions.</p><p>The biggest point to the Advanced section is building solutions in Azure, which requires constant learning as part of your strategy. Things around computing are going to change fast;  so <span>make sure you have walked a mile in those shoes before using the new changes.</span></p></div></div>
