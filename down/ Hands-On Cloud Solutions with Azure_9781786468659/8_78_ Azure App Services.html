This helps reduce latency and outbound data-transfer charges for cross-region usage.</p><p>The following are the <span>best</span><a id="id324953588" class="indexterm"></a> practices for App Services:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span>Use App Services' Auto-Healing feature, like recycling when request response is slow.</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Scale up to control the number of users per instance, and scale out to control the load over the user. Scaling out can be controlled through autoscaling; however, autoscale is dependent on the pricing tier.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Try to create your apps to be stateless to help with scaling.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">If you have GDFR or PII requirements, use App Service Environments and isolate App Services.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use Azure Active Directory or Azure B2C to secure your apps.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Restrict access to need-to-know and least privileges, for both application permissions and resource permissions.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip33"></a>Note</h3><p>If large media files are present, consider implementing CDN.</p></div><p>The following practices should be avoided:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Do not turn on autoscaling without understanding the consequences.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">To not <span>leverage logging your application, it is highly important you build logging into your application.</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Do not put keys or secrets in configuration files—protect your keys by using Azure Key Vault instead.</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip34"></a>Note</h3><p>To help control cost, pay attention to the tier options, because although they may appear to cost more per month, you may be able to run fewer instances, as you won't need to scale out as much. For instance, the PremiumV2 tier gives you a faster CPU, SSD storage, and double memory-to-core ratio, which means that you can run your apps on fewer instances.</p></div></div>
