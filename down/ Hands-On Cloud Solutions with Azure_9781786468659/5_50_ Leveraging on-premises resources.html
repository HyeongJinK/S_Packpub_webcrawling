If you use static routing, this is not supported.  VPN solutions come with a premium cost but are worth it in my eyes, <span>as they allow Azure resources to interact with on-premise resources, like the data on the internal network. </span> But, you should really understand your needs before venturing down this trail.</p><p>Most developers make the mistake that they need to move everything to Azure when hybrid solutions may be more in line.  This becomes apparent with larger enterprise-based systems that are not in Azure or good candidates for moving to Azure.  But, creating a secure way to access these resources is paramount.  When considering how to build your hybrid solution, there are three security models you should consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Synchronized</strong></span>: Is the simplest <span>and</span><a id="id324953605" class="indexterm"></a> quickest method, and may require the user to maintain two passwords unless you sync the hash of the user's password with an on-premises AD.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Pass-through</strong></span>: Is a simple <span>password</span><a id="id324953619" class="indexterm"></a> validation against your on-premises AD, hence AAD passes the sign-in validation to an on-premises AD directly.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Federated</strong></span>: Is an SSO solution <span>that</span><a id="id325433833" class="indexterm"></a> allows the user to authenticate using on-premises credentials for an Azure resource using the ADFS infrastructure to achieve high availability and scale, which allows you to simplify management with the Azure portal.</li></ol></div><p> </p><p> </p><p>Each of these options has their merits, so really consider how you want to approach this and review the pros and cons of each before choosing a path.</p></div>
