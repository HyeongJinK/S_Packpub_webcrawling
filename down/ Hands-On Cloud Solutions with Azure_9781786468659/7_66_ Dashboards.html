However, these don't really have much to do with dashboards. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"></a>Note</h3><p>The type property for all dashboards is <code class="literal">Microsoft.Portal/dashboards</code><span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>and the location property indicates the primary geographic location that stores the dashboard JSON because dashboards do not have a runtime component.</p></div><p>The <code class="literal">properties</code> object contains two elements, called <code class="literal">lenses</code> and <code class="literal">metadata</code>. Lenses contain the parts of the dashboard and metadata is for future features. Input values are also allowed for the dashboard component, such as the App Service or VM that are supplying the data. Let's take a look at a dashboard in Azure in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/a8759f25-a479-4d65-848b-74692c212ed1.png" /></div><p>Azure Dashboard</p><p>When I started using Azure dashboards, I had to create a new one each time I changed what I wanted to display between environments, for Dev, QA, and Prod. This was very difficult to manage and support; however, as you can see in the preceding screenshot, there is an ability to upload/download and clone. They can also be shared with groups or individuals. In the following screenshot, you will see <span>what</span><a id="id325433757" class="indexterm"></a> happens when you edit a dashboard. This is where you can add components to the dashboard from the side menu. I always include a text/HTML component to add some free text information:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/92392c40-faf9-4ff3-a9b5-37869be58798.png" /></div><p>Editing a dashboard</p><p>There is also the ability to add a component to dashboards as you review resources by pinning them. To pin, you will click on the thumbtack icon of the component you want to add. Make sure you have the dashboard selected that you want to pin to before pinning the component. In the following screenshot, let's see how this is done:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/49e11c7e-5a5f-44b5-9086-d6b177066ebe.png" /></div><p>Pinning a component in Azure Portal</p><p>Once you click on it, it will add it to the active dashboard. Let's see what that looks like in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/2c6aa0f1-9cdc-4cb4-ad0e-8e8e20cf07ca.png" /></div><p>Pinned component on a dashboard</p><p>As you can see, dashboards are <span>extremely</span><a id="id325435305" class="indexterm"></a> powerful visual elements in Azure that can provide quick landing pads for important application visualization elements, such as errors, data usage, and cost. Now, we can dive deeper into application support by using the Azure Advisors. Let's see how.</p></div>
