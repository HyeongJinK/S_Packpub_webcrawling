These services include servers/VMs, physical storage, data repositories, networking resources, analytics, software, and more. These services are offered at a much smaller pay-for-use model than physical data centers and organizations generally migrate to the compute service model for the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Global</strong></span> allows an organization to <span>scale</span><a id="id325433764" class="indexterm"></a> elastically and allow regional entry points, providing a more consistent experience for their user base</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span> allows the faster provision of resources and <span>helps</span><a id="id325433778" class="indexterm"></a> release pressure on capacity planning because it removed the need to order and wait for resources</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cost</strong></span> is simplified into a pay-as-you-go model, removing the <span>capital</span><a id="id325438599" class="indexterm"></a> expense over the physical resources</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> is provided through an <span>extensive</span><a id="id325438613" class="indexterm"></a> set of policies and controls that strengthen your overall security posture</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Productivity</strong></span> is increased by removing a <span>significant</span><a id="id325438659" class="indexterm"></a> number of tasks, such as hardware setup, patching, and other operational management chores</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Performance</strong></span> is achieved through worldwide <span>distribution</span><a id="id325438673" class="indexterm"></a> of services and is regularly updated to the latest generation of computing hardware</li></ul></div><p>Cloud computing comes in private, public, and hybrid types, with each offering its own benefits:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Public clouds</strong></span> are generally owned by <span>third</span><a id="id325438692" class="indexterm"></a> parties such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, who control all the supporting infrastructure, hardware, and software</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Private clouds</strong></span> are owned by a <span>business</span><a id="id325439834" class="indexterm"></a> and maintained on a private network</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Hybrid clouds</strong></span> are combinations of public and private, as <span>well</span><a id="id325439848" class="indexterm"></a> as on-premise resources</li></ul></div><p>But at the end of the day, what problems do clouds solve?
