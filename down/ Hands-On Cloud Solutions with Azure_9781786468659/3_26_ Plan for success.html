At that point everyone started running in every direction, then one turned around an said—<span class="emphasis"><em>where is the finish line</em></span>? You see I had a vision I did not share and the participants couldn't plan, not only where they were running, but how to dress for it. So, as you can see things can get crazy when you don't plan and set the proper expectations. This is the same thing <span>when</span><a id="id324953586" class="indexterm"></a> you move to Azure; you want to ensure success with a plan/governance. </p><p>Most organizations I have seen don't spend the time creating the governance and end up having systems and applications that leave them open to vulnerabilities that are <span>not</span><a id="id325433769" class="indexterm"></a> managed properly. <span class="strong"><strong>Scaffolding</strong></span> is used in Azure to create a structure that allows admins to ensure workloads meets minimum requirements in accordance with the plan/governance. This will hopefully create minimum interference with meeting goals quickly. I have already discussed the importance of subscriptions, resource groups, and naming conventions but let's look at some other important things to note.</p><p>To extend the conversation on resources, I recommend creating policies to help control the resource that engineers are able to deploy. You can also combine auditing features to help create a well-rounded view. This can help with Geo-compliance and data sovereignty by restricting the region's resources can be deployed. This can also help with cost management by restricting the types of resources that can be deployed. This can also extend to resource tags, which can help with auditing.</p><p>Resource tags are a way to group resources together by feature or department, for example.  You can leverage then to create chargeback views to departments.  To help with a naming convention, review the documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip16"></a>Note</h3><p>Create a <span>Resource Policy</span> that mandates tags for your Azure resources, which can be used across subscriptions.</p></div><p><span>One of the biggest things I have leverage in Azure to protect deletion of my resources, which I believe most don't know about, is Azure resource locks</span>, which can be applied to subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.  I use them in production environments to keep people from deleting resources accidentally. Resource locks currently have two values—<code class="literal">CanNotDelete</code> and <code class="literal">ReadOnly</code>.  <code class="literal">CanNotDelete</code> means that a resource can be read and modified but not deleted.  <code class="literal">ReadOnly</code> means a resource can be modified or deleted.  As we move forward, we need to understand architectural styles, so let's dive into that.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
