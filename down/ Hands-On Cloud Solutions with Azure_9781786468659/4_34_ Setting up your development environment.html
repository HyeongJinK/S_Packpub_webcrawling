In Visual Studio, please ensure the following Workloads are installed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/04ae2bed-690e-4b39-a342-ec7318e2e44a.png" /></div><p><span>Visual Studio Workloads for Azure Development</span></p><p>Now that you have installed/verified Visual Studio, let’s head over to Azure DevOps at <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.azure.com/" target="_blank">https://dev.azure.com/</a>, and sign in with the Microsoft or organization account you would like to associate with Azure DevOps.

As we begin, we will focus on web and mobile development to keep the code samples simple for this book.  While doing this, we will leverage a service-oriented approach.  Now, as we <span>discussed</span><a id="id325438597" class="indexterm"></a> in prior chapters, you can choose your options to deploy, based on your comfort level, as you can see in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/995c4be2-0a66-426c-a616-94434c719e3e.png" /></div><p>Choices for App Deploys</p><p>Your data repository can be your traditional SQL or you can opt for a NoSQL solution. I would, however, caution you against using NoSQL solutions unless you are familiar with them. They require some retry coding to reduce cost. You can also provide cloud to cloud or on-premises solution by adding Docker support, but here also I would caution you as it requires more infrastructure and <span>a deeper understanding</span>. So, we will stick with the tradition web application approach for simplicity and I will try to add some Docker color where I can.
