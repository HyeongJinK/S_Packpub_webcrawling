Separate subscriptions introduce the need for a second layer of networking infrastructure, or for cross-subscription virtual networks through site-to-site VPNs. While it is possible to do, it does increase complexity.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Do not use a subscription as the primary method of delegating administration. Subscriptions should be a very high-level administrative container, but that’s it. However, it might make sense, for example, to have one subscription per IT department in a company with multiple IT departments.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Avoid spanning applications across multiple subscriptions, even with multiple environments, because it reduces your ability to view and manage all the related items from one place and on one bill.
</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">If you have multiple subscriptions (for example, Azure DevTest access on an MSDN subscription), don’t split these subscriptions by development, testing, and production; instead, split by groups of apps, with each entire app and its related apps contained within a single subscription.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Do not proactively split subscriptions based on the fact that, eventually, you will need more resources. Resource limits are always increasing, so by the time you may get close to a present-day limit, it will likely have been increased.</li></ul></div></div>
