They are like little helpers that move through your applications in Azure and provide some great feedback on issues before they become a problem. They do this by analyzing your configurations and telemetry data and making recommendations.</p><p>Azure Advisors assist with the following errors:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">High availability</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Security</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Performance</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Cost</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/91cc33b5-ef01-431f-a73e-f0bb5fd57251.png" /></div><p>Azure Advisors</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"></a>Note</h3><p>To access Azure Advisors, you need to be in the <span class="strong"><strong>Owner</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Contributor</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Reader role</strong></span> within the <span class="strong"><strong>Subscription</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec33"></a>High Availability Advisor</h3></div></div></div><p>This handles business-critical applications to <span>ensure</span><a id="id325433796" class="indexterm"></a> and improve continuity.

For example, you can see in the preceding screenshot that I skipped <span class="strong"><strong>soft delete</strong></span> for my storage.

In the following screenshot, you can see the <span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> tab. I leverage the <span class="strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> tab as <span>much</span><a id="id325680731" class="indexterm"></a> as I can to double-check my resources in Azure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/533a5441-afe2-473a-a696-2f78032c1aa0.png" /></div><p>Security Advisor</p><p>In the Azure Security Center, you want to pay attention to the severity of the issue(s). You can drill into the issue by double-clicking on the issue, and, as with the other advisor, it will take you to the point where you can fix the issue:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/f5dad253-32ac-4ae5-b563-8a4fd313ecb4.png" /></div><p>Security Center</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To learn more about the Security Center, head to <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations</a>. Depending on your organization needs, you will find what you need. I use the Azure Security Center for setting up policies and monitoring security, as well as to set up alerts. For more info on Security alerts go to <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.</a></p><p>You would use Azure Security Center for the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Managing security policy settings with defined desired configurations of workloads and compliance.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Monitoring security health to monitor your Azure resources</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Applying cloud defenses that provide adaptive app controls and file integrity monitors</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Managing security solutions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Investigating threats</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Automating security workflows</li></ul></div><p>I recommend leveraging as much as you need, to help secure your applications and infrastructure.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec35"></a>Performance Advisor</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Performance Advisor</strong></span> provides performance recommendations to help import the responsiveness of <span>your</span><a id="id325852471" class="indexterm"></a> resources. I use it mostly to review VMs and App Services performance and reliability. I usually monitor memory and CPU exhaustion and <span>database</span><a id="id325852480" class="indexterm"></a> performance. I use it to check for the following on my App Services:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li>When more memory is consumed than expected</li><li>When more CPU is consumed than expected</li><li>When a socket resource is exhausted</li><li>When backup fails</li><li>When deployment happens</li></ol></div><p>The blade for this is pretty simple and follows the same drill in clicking as other Advisors. A view of the blade is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/bb0f9a6a-c8a2-4601-a47f-7ba27ece3285.png" /></div><p>Performance blade</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec36"></a>Cost Advisor</h3></div></div></div><p>This Advisor is pretty self-explanatory <span>and</span><a id="id325852523" class="indexterm"></a> is probably the most useful one as you learn Azure. It will make recommendations based on the consumption of your resources. There is <span>more</span><a id="id325852532" class="indexterm"></a> to drill into here and you will need to set up a Cloudyn account. <span class="strong"><strong>Cloudyn</strong></span> is Azure's Cost Management tool and it helps you to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Monitor cloud spend</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Drive organizational accountability</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Optimize cloud efficiency</li></ul></div><p>You will be directed to <a class="ulink" href="https://azure.cloudyn.com/web-app2/#/azure-registration/intro" target="_blank">https://azure.cloudyn.com/web-app2/#/azure-registration/intro</a> to create the connection. You will need to be an administrator and subscription owner to configure it, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/50709e39-7021-4a1a-8355-e9db8882ae72.png" /></div><p>Cloudyn setup</p><p>I can't stress enough the importance of keeping an eye on your burn as you learn about Azure. So, let's look at how we monitor resources and cost in Azure.</p></div></div>
