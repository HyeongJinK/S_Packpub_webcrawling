Now, I would only use this if you needed a quick POC deployment over a traditional process, but I did want to note and show the Deployment Center option, as we seeÂ in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/7fa5cf05-763d-4ccb-a587-890be23306db.png" /></div><p>Deployment Center</p><p>This can be leveraged as a CI/CD, as things that are checked into the repository will get deployed, but as I stated, I prefer a more robust system that matches requirement to code for better overall project tracking. As you can see in the preceding figure, you can use:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Azure DevOps (still says VSTS)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">GitHub</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Bitbucket</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Local Git</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">OneDrive</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dropbox</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">External</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">FTP</li></ul></div><p>The Azure DevOps will create a pipeline for you in your Azure DevOps project or link to an existing one. This gives great flexibility in creating your pipeline for deployments. But again, create a process that works for you and your team that meets your goals as a group and fits within your proficiencies.</p></div>
