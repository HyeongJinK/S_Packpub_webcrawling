This becomes important because while logging was important, it was often skipped because of time constraints on development. In Azure, the tools and logs are a bit harder to understand and control. You should also develop your applications to be more self-healing and fail gracefully, and if you don’t plan on logging you can create issues with troubleshooting or support your applications. I personally use NLog and Application Insights to help solve these issues in Azure. They help me with monitoring and alerting, and I can also leverage Azure Monitor or OMS to bring everything together. <span>I would at approaching the development process as you can see in the following figure:</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781786468659/graphics/011de46b-4300-4783-a633-4d95f97814cf.png" /></div><p>Development process</p><p><span>With this software application that run-in the cloud is by nature complex software that relies on a significant amount of resources and code.</span> So, as you develop your applications you should ensure your developers are using a production-like environment. You also want to track your technical debt. As you head down this path, you want to ensure you automate your testing and test for failures. You should also automate performance testing to identify issues early, and also with capacity testing. I love to use CI/CD processes with small incremental changes, which we will discuss in depth in future chapters.</p><p>Now, another hurdle that I had to learn is about building my infrastructure as code. In prior chapters, we had a small section on deploying a VM and a VM running SQL, but let’s dive into this a little further, as we will be leveraging ARM templates as we continue our journey.</p><p> </p></div>
