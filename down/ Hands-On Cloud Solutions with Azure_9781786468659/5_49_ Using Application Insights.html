With Azure being a closed ecosystem, you will struggle to support your applications without logging in your application that can tell you what is going on.  I like to leverage <span class="strong"><strong>Azure Application Insights</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>NLog</strong></span> to help <span>with</span><a id="id325432068" class="indexterm"></a> logging in my applications; then, I can build my monitoring from there. Application Insights can be installed with most resources and gives you some insights for free, almost like the event log on a traditional server.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Application Insights</strong></span> provides telemetry about your app, and when things don't get right, it is good to understand that there are two main types of telemetry—raw and aggregated instances. Aggregated data includes the counts of events per unit of time or averages.  Now, it is good to understand the following categories of collected data:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Dependencies</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">App Requests</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exceptions</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Page Views</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Performance counters</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Log Traces</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Custom Events</li></ul></div><p><span>Application Insights also has the ability for smart detection and raises issues automatically.</span>  It also can provide a Live Metric stream for up-to-date metrics on your app and application maps <span>that show all the connection points</span>.  But the biggest piece, at least for me, is the analytics you can gain from SQL-like queries of the data it has collected.  You can view the raw data or you can visualize it in charts and graphs.  The telemetry data is also available in Visual Studio for debugging and such. Take some time to learn more about Application Insights, as it will most likely pay for itself on first use.
