This will help keep you on the right track and also help with budgeting for your services. I try to approach this in the following way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Put together the expectations you plan to achieve. This will help keep you on the right path.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">You need to know the apps you are moving and creating. Understand the dependencies, creating sequence diagrams, and flow between resources. This helps with using the Azure pricing calculator.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">I like to prototype, which allows me to test and assess my resources.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">I keep an eye on cost and create alerts when the cost gets close to budgets. You can also put spending limits on subscriptions, but I wouldn't suggest that as once it is hit, your resources will stop working.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">I recommend using tags on your resources to group and monitor data., which can also be alerted on. <span>I leverage this more when I want to track billing by the department so I can charge to their budget.</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use the Azure Cost Advisor to help review burn and adjust costs.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use development and code to help estimate; for example, CosmosDB code snippets to get the cost of a query for estimating.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">You can use <span>pre-paid for your subscription</span> to get a discount in 6-12 month increments.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Set up an EA or CSP with Microsoft to get discounts on resources.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use programs, such as Partners or Bizspark, to receive free allocations by the month.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Use free resources in non-production environments.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">If you use VMs, size them correctly for expected users. You can start low and then scale up and out.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Instead of VMs, use PaaS resources.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Leverage elastic pools in SQL.</li></ul></div><p> </p><p> </p></div>
