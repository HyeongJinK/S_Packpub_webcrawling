However, there are a lot of features that are common to many web applications, which means that many applications will require code that does the same task for each web application. To solve this problem, and avoid reinventing the wheel, people have created extensions for Flask, and we have seen many Flask extensions already throughout the book. This chapter will focus on some of the more useful Flask extensions that don't have enough content to separate them out into their own chapter, but will save you a lot of time and frustration.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Developing a debug toolbar, with great backend performance metrics</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Page cache using Redis or memcached</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating an administration back office, with CRUD functionality for all your models</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Enabling internationalization (i18n), and translating your site into multiple languages</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Sending emails easily</li></ul></div></div>
