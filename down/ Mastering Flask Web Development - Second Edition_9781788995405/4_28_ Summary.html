We have introduced you to the concept of request context and started showing you some new features that will enable us to scale our applications easily to any size, using Blueprints and Method Class views.</p><p>We now have our app working inside a blueprint, but what does this give us? Let's say that we wanted to add a photo sharing function to our site, we would be able to group all the view functions into one blueprint with its own templates, static folder, and URL prefix without any fear of disrupting the functionality of the rest of the site.</p><p>In the next chapter, blueprints will be made even more powerful by separating them into different files after upgrading our file and code structure.</p></div>
