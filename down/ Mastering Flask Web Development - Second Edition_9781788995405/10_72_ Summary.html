We now have a fully featured administrator interface, a useful debugging tool in the browser, two tools that greatly speed up page load times, and a utility to make sending emails less of a headache.</p><p>As was stated at the start of this chapter, Flask is bare-bones, and allows you to pick and choose the functionality that you want. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessary to include all of these extensions in your app. If you are the only content creator working on your app, the CLI might be all you need, because adding in these features takes up development time (and maintenance time, when they inevitably break). This warning is given at the end of the chapter, because one of the main reasons many Flask apps become unwieldy is because they include so many extensions, that testing and maintaining all of them becomes a very large task.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn the internals of how an extension works, and how to create your own extension.</p></div>
