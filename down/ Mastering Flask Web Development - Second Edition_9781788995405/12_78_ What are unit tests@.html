All it involves is developing code that will run particular <span>pieces</span><a id="id324974945" class="indexterm"></a> of your program and specifying what you expect the results to be, and then comparing it to what the results from the piece of the program actually are. If the results are the same, the test passes. If the results are different, the test fails. Typically, these tests are run upon Pull Request creation on your CI server, so all the reviewers of the PR can immediately check if the requested change breaks something or not. </p><p> </p><p>In program testing, there are three main types of tests. <span class="strong"><strong>Unit tests</strong></span> are tests that verify the correctness of individual pieces of code, such as functions. Second is <span class="strong"><strong>integration testing</strong></span>, which tests the correctness of various units of programs working in tandem. The last type of testing is <span class="strong"><strong>end-to-end testing</strong></span>, which tests the <span>correctness</span><a id="id325368993" class="indexterm"></a> of the whole system at once, rather than individual <span>pieces</span><a id="id325369001" class="indexterm"></a>. Many other types of testing exist, some of which include load tests, security tests, and recovery tests.</p><p>In this chapter, we will be using unit testing and end-to-end testing in order to verify that our code is working as planned. </p><p>This brings us to some of the first rules of code testing: make sure your tests can actually fail, write simple test functions that test only one thing, and make your test code easy to read and write. </p></div>
