It usually focuses on speed and scalability. NoSQL has been taking the web development world by storm for the past seven years. Huge companies, <span>such as Netflix and Google, have announced that they are moving</span> many of their services to NoSQL databases, and many smaller companies have followed their example.</p><p>This chapter will deviate from the rest of the book in that it will not mostly focus on Flask. The focus on the database design might seem odd in a book about Flask, but choosing the correct database for your application is arguably the most important decision that you can make while designing your technology stack. In the vast majority of web applications, the database is the bottleneck, so the database you pick will determine the overall speed of your app. A study conducted by Amazon showed that even a 100 ms delay caused a one percent reduction in sales, so speed should always be one of the main concerns of a web developer. There is also an abundance of horror stories in the programmer community of web developers involving developers choosing a popular NoSQL database and then not really understanding what the database requires in terms of administration. This leads to large amounts of data loss and crashes, which in turn means the loss of customers. All in all, it's no exaggeration to say that your choice of database for your application can be the difference between your app succeeding and failing.</p><p>In this chapter, we will illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of NoSQL databases by examining each type of NoSQL database and the differences between NoSQL and traditional databases.</p><p> </p></div>
