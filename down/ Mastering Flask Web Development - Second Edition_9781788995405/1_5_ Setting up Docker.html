You might be using a cache, <span class="strong"><strong>redis</strong></span>, workers with <span class="strong"><strong>Celery</strong></span>, a messaging queuing system, or something else. Normally, all of the systems that are needed for your application to work are collectively referred to as <span class="strong"><strong>stack</strong></span>. One simple way to <span>easily</span><a id="id325369006" class="indexterm"></a> define and quickly spawn all these components is to use <span class="strong"><strong>Docker</strong></span> containers. With Docker, you define all of your application components and how to install and configure them, and you can then share your stack with your team, and send it to production with the exact same specification.</p><p> </p><p>You can download and install <span>Docker</span><a id="id325371652" class="indexterm"></a> from <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/install/</a>.</p><p>First, let's create a very simple <span class="strong"><strong>Dockerfile</strong></span>. This file defines how to set up your application. Each line will serve as a container layer for very fast rebuilds. A very simple Dockerfile will look like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">FROM python:3.6.5
# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app
# Copy local contents into the container
ADD . /app
# Install all required dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "main.py"]</pre><p>Next, let's build out first container image. We will tag it as <code class="literal">chapter_1</code> for further ease of use, as shown in the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>$ docker build -t chapter_1 .
</strong></span></pre><p>Then we will run it, as shown in the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>$ docker run -p 5000:5000 chapter_1
# List all the running containers
$ docker container list</strong></span></pre><p>Docker is easy, but it's a complex tool with lots of options for configuring and deploying containers. We will look at Docker in more detail in <span><a class="link" href="#" linkend="ch13">Chapter 13</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying Flask Apps</em></span></span>.</p></div>
