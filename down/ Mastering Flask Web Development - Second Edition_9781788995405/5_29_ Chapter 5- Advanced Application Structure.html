However, having our application entirely reside in one file needlessly clutters our code. This is one of the advantages of Flask; you can write a small REST service or web application on a single file, or a full-blown enterprise application. The framework won't get in your way and won't impose any project layout.</p><p>To make the application code clearer and more comprehensible, we will transform the entire code into a Python module and each feature into a module by itself. This modular approach enables you to scale easily and in a predictable way, so new features will have an obvious place and structure. In this chapter, you will learn the best practices for the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a modular application that easily scales</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Application factory pattern</li></ul></div></div>
