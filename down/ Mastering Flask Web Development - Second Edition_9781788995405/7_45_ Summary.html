We explored the main types of NoSQL systems and why an application might need, or not need, to be designed with a NoSQL database. We addressed the CAP theorem and its implications regarding modern database systems.</p><p>Using our app's models as a base, the power of MongoDB and MongoEngine was shown by demonstrating how simple it was to set up complex relationships and inheritance.</p><p>In the next chapter, our blogging application will be extended with a feature designed for other programmers who wish to use our site to build their own serviceâ€”that is, RESTful endpoints.</p></div>
