It was defined by Roy Fielding in his PhD dissertation in 2000. REST aims to implement a standard for uniform and predefined operations between systems. These systems can be client browsers, mobile applications, servers running parallel worker processes—you name it. By using HTTP methods, REST is platform- and programming-language-agnostic, and decouples the client and the server for easier development. This is typically used in web <span class="strong"><strong>single-page applications</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SPAs</strong></span>) that need to pull or update user information on the server. REST is also used to provide outside developers with a common interface to access user data. For example, Facebook and Twitter use REST in their application program interface, or API.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip33"></a>Note</h3><p>You can take a look at Roy Fielding's original dissertation on REST at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" target="_blank">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm</a>.</p></div><p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The HTTP protocol: requests, responses, methods, headers, and the URI format</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to build a REST service</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to secure a REST service using JWT</li></ul></div></div>
