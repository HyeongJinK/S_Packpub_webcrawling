So far, have learned to implement a variety of cutting-edge AI algorithms in TensorFlow and built cool projects on the side. Specifically, we have <span>built</span><a id="id325830310" class="indexterm"></a> projects on reinforcement learning, Bayesian neural networks, capsule networks, and <span class="strong"><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GANs</strong></span>), among others. We have also learned about several modules of TensorFlow, including TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow Probability, among others. This surely deserves a pat on the back and a well-earned rest.</p><p>Before we go out to play, there are a few more things that we should consider reading about before we are prime-time ready to deploy these cutting edge techniques in production. As we will realize in this chapter, there is more to deploying a machine learning model in production than just implementing the latest research paper in AI. To understand what I mean by this, let's read through the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">TensorFlow utilities to deploy models in production</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">General rules for building AI applications</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Limitations of <span>deep learning</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Applications of AI across different industries</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span>Ethical Considerations in AI</span></li></ul></div></div>
