These days, a variety of ML applications are being used in our daily lives and we don't <span>even</span><a id="id326249593" class="indexterm"></a> realize it. Since ML has taken the spotlight, it would be helpful if we could use it to run deep models on mobile devices, which is one of the most used devices in our daily life.</p><p>Innovation in mobile hardware, coupled with new software frameworks for deploying ML models on mobile devices, is proving to be one of the major accelerators for developing ML based applications on mobile or other edge devices like tablet..</p><p>In this chapter, we will learn about Google's new library, TensorFlow Lite, which can be used to deploy ML models on mobile devices. We will train a deep learning model on the MNIST digits dataset and look at how we can convert this model into a mobile-friendly format by understanding the following concepts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">A brief introduction to TensorFlow Lite and its architecture</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to Classification model evaluation metrics</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Developing a deep learning model on the MNIST dataset</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Converting the trained model into a mobile-friendly format using TensorFlow Lite</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"></a>Note</h3><p>Note that this chapter will not discuss building an Android application to deploy these models since this has been extensively documented in Google's TensorFlow tutorials (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/" target="_blank">https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/</a>). </p></div></div>
