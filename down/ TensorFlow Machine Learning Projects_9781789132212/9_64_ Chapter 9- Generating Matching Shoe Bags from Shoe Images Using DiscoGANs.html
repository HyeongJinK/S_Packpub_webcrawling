For example, we can easily understand the relationship between a Spanish sentence and its translated version in English. We can even guess which color tie to wear to match a certain kind of suit. While it seems easy for humans, this is not a straightforward process for machines.</p><p>The task of style transfer across different domains for machines can be framed as a conditional image generation problem. Given an image from one domain, can we learn to map to an image from a different domain.</p><p>While there have been many approaches to achieve this using pairwise labeled data from two different domains, these approaches are fraught with problems. The major issue with these approaches is obtaining the pairwise labeled data, which is both an expensive and time-consuming process.</p><p>In this chapter, we will learn <span>about</span><a id="id326075047" class="indexterm"></a> an approach for learning style transfer without explicitly providing pairwise labeled data to the algorithm. This approach, known as DiscoGANs, is highlighted in the recently released paper by Kim et. al  named <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations with Generative Adversarial Networks</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf</a>). Specifically, we will try to generate matching shoes from shoe bag images.</p><p>The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to <span class="strong"><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GANs</strong></span>)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">What are DiscoGANs?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">How to generate matching shoes from shoe bag images and vice versa</li></ul></div></div>
