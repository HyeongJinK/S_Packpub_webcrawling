This chapter will cover the inner workings of capsule networks and explain how to implement them in TensorFlow. You will also learn how to evaluate and optimize the model.</p><p>We have chosen capsule networks because they have the ability to preserve the spatial relationships of images. Capsule networks were introduced by <span>Geoff Hinto</span>n, et al. They published a paper in 2017 that can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829</a>. Capsule networks gained immense popularity within the deep learning community as a new type of neural network.</p><p>By the end of this chapter, we will be able to classify clothing using capsule networks after going through the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the importance of capsule networks</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">A brief understanding of capsules </li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The routing by agreement algorithm</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The implementation of the CapsNet architecture for classifying <span>Fashion-MNIST</span> images</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The limitations of capsule networks</li></ul></div></div>
