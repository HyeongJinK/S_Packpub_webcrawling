However, there are many applications, such as stock trading, customer support conversations where it might be helpful to predict sentiment of the text with low latency. One obvious bottleneck in reducing latency is the server call. </p><p>If sentiment analysis could be achieved on the browser/client itself, we can get rid of the server call and can predict the sentiment in real time. Google recently released TensorFlow.js, which enables us to do the model training and inference on a browser/client.</p><p>Additionally, training the models on the client side opens up a world of opportunities. A brief summary of all the advantages of doing this are as follows: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Priv</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>acy</strong></span>: Since data will never leave the client side, we are able to provide the magical experience of machine learning without compromising on data privacy</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>No hassle ML</strong></span>: Since the code runs on a browser, the user doesn't need to install any libraries or dependencies</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Latency</strong></span>: Since there is no need to transfer data to servers for training/predictions, we can deploy ML models for low latency applications</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Device agnostic</strong></span>: A web page can be opened on any device (laptop, mobile. and so on) and so TensorFlow.js can take advantage of any hardware (GPU) or device sensors, such as accelerometers in mobile devices, to train ML models</li></ul></div><p>Let's learn how to incorporate sentiment analysis in the browser using TensorFlow.js by covering the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding TensorFlow.js</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span>Understanding Adam Optimization</span></li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding Categorical Cross Entropy Loss</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding Word Embeddings</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up the sentiment analysis problem and building a model in Python</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Deploying the model using TensorFlow.js in a browser</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip23"></a>Note</h3><p>Find the code for this <span>chapter and Installation</span>instructions are also present in a <span class="strong"><strong>README</strong></span> file in repository for this project.</p></div></div>
