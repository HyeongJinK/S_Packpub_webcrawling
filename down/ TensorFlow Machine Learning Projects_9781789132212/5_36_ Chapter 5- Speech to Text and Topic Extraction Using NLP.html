There have been several different technologies deployed to recognize spoken words in the past. Most of those approaches <span>were</span><a id="id326425756" class="indexterm"></a> very limited in <span>their</span><a id="id326425765" class="indexterm"></a> scope, as they were unable to recognize a wide variety of words, accents, and tones, and aspects of spoken language, such as a <span>pause</span><a id="id326425749" class="indexterm"></a> between <span>spoken</span><a id="id326425748" class="indexterm"></a> words. Some of the prevalent modeling technique for speech recognition include <span class="strong"><strong>Hidden Markov Models</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HMM</strong></span>), <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic Time Warping</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DTW</strong></span>), <span class="strong"><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Network</strong></span>s (<span class="strong"><strong>LSTM</strong></span>), and <span class="strong"><strong>Connectionist Temporal Classification</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CTC</strong></span>).</p><p>In this chapter, we shall learn about various options for speech to text and the prebuilt model from Google's TensorFlow team, using the Speech Commands Dataset.
