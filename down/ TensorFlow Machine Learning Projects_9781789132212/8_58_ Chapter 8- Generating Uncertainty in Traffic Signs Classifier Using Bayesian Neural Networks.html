For example, we always want to know what the chances are of it raining before we leave the house. However, with traditional deep learning, we only have a point prediction and no notion of uncertainty. Predictions from these networks are assumed to be accurate, which is not always the case. Ideally, we would like to know the level of confidence of predictions from neural networks before making a decision.</p><p>For example, having uncertainty in the model could have potentially avoided the following disastrous consequences:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">In May 2016, the Tesla Model S crashed in northern Florida into a truck that was turning left in front of it. According to the official Tesla blog (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/tragic-loss" target="_blank">https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/tragic-loss</a>), <span class="emphasis"><em>Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied</em></span>.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">In July 2015, two African Americans were classified as gorillas by Google's image classifier, raising concerns of racial discrimination.

The question now is: If it's so obvious, why didn't Tesla or Google implement it in the first place?</p><p>Bayesian algorithms (like Gaussian processes) can quantify uncertainty, but cannot scale to large datasets such as images and videos, whereas deep learning is able to produce much better accuracy—except that it lacks any notion of uncertainty.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore the concept of Bayesian neural networks, which combines the concepts of deep learning and Bayesian learning with model uncertainty in the predictions of deep neural networks.
