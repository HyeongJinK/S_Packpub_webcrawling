There are many open source SDKs and commercial paid cloud services that allow us to convert from audio recordings and files to text data. As an example project, we took Google's Speech Commands Dataset and TensorFlow's deep learning-based example to convert audio files to spoken words in order to recognize the commands.</p><p>In the next chapter, we continue this journey to build a project for predicting stock prices using Gaussian Processes, which is a popular algorithm for forecasting.</p></div>
