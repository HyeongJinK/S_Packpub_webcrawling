Some of the limitations of capsule networks are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The network has not been tested on large datasets like ImageNet. This puts a question mark on their ability to perform well on large datasets.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The algorithm is slow, mainly due to the inner loop of the dynamic routing algorithm. The number of iterations can be fairly large for large datasets.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Capsule networks definitely have higher complexity in implementation compared to CNNs.Â </li></ul></div><p>It would be interesting to see how the deep learning community addresses the limitations of capsule networks.</p></div>
