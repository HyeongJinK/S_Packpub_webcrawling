CNNs work by detecting the basic features that are present in the lower layers of the network and then proceed to detect the higher level features present in the higher layers of the network. This <span>setup</span><a id="id326086718" class="indexterm"></a> does not contain a pose (translational and rotational) relationship between the lower-level features that make up any complex object.</p><p>Imagine trying to identify a face. In this case, just having eyes, nose, and ears in an image can lead a CNN to conclude that it's a face without caring about the relative orientation of the concerned objects. To explain this further, if an image has a nose above the eyes, CNNs still can detect that it's an image. CNNs take care of this problem by using <span class="emphasis"><em>max pooling</em></span>, which helps increase the <span class="emphasis"><em>field of view</em></span> for the higher layers. However, this operation is not a perfect solution as we tend to lose valuable information in the image by using it.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Hinton himself states the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"The pooling operation used in convolutional neural networks is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In <span>the paper,</span> Hinton tries to provide an intuition on solving this problem using the inverse graphics approach. For graphics in computers, an image is constructed by using an internal representation of the objects present in the image. This is done using arrays and matrices. This internal representation helps preserve the shape, the orientation, and the object's relative position when compared to all other objects in the image. The software takes this internal representation and publishes the image on the screen using a process known as <span class="strong"><strong>rendering</strong></span>.</p><p>Hinton specifies that the human brain does some sort of inverse graphics. We see an image through our eyes, and then brain our dissects the image and constructs a hierarchical representation of different objects in the image before trying to match them to the existing patterns that we have seen. An interesting observation to note is that humans can identify objects in an image, irrespective of their viewing angle.</p><p>He then proceeds to argue that in order to perform classification, it is necessary to preserve the relative orientation and position of different objects in the image (this helps mimic the human capability, as we discussed previously). It's quite intuitive that once we have these relationships built into the representation using the model, it is very easy for a model to detect an object when it views it from various angles. Let's imagine the case of viewing the Taj Mahal (the famous monument in India). Our eyes can identify the Taj Mahal from various angles. However, if you present the same images to a CNN, it might fail to detect the Taj Mahal from different viewpoints. This is because CNNs don't have an understanding of 3D space like our brains do. This is the reason capsule network theory is quite important. </p><p>One of the major concerns here is this: <span class="emphasis"><em>How do we incorporate these hierarchical relationships into the deep neural networks?</em></span> The relationship between different objects in an image is modeled by something called a <span class="strong"><strong>pose</strong></span>, which is basically rotation and translation. This is specific to the graphics of a computer. We will look at how these relationships are modeled in capsule networks in the subsequent sections.</p></div>
