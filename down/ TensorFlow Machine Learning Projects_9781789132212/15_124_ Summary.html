Thereafter, we understood how TensorFlow Serving provide tools and libraries to deploy deep learning models at scale. Lastly, we learned about the open source components of <span class="strong"><strong>TensorFlow Extended</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>TFX</strong></span>), which is a machine learning platform from Google. TFX helps in the entire model building pipeline, from data analysis to model deployment.</p><p>Next, we learned about several best practices when building scalable AI products. Building a robust engineering pipeline and trying out simple models before deep learning and always launching new models with A/B tests are few of them.</p><p>Thereafter, we dispensed the hype around deep learning by understanding the limitations of deep neural networks. Specifically, we learned that they require huge amounts of data and compute power for building good, accurate models. Also, the fact that they are not interpretable makes them unusable in many AI applications. We also looked at various applications of AI across different industries and learned about the importance of ethics in AI.</p><p>Lastly, if you have made it this far and completed the projects, I thank you and congratulate you for your awesome achievement. You have acquired the necessary skills to build practical AI applications using state-of-the-art techniques in reinforcement learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, among others. I would request that you now use your knowledge for good and make this world a better place.</p><p>I would like to end this book with my favorite quote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The future is not some place we are going, but one we are creating.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>- John H.
