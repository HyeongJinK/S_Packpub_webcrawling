We also looked at the advantages and disadvantages of using LSTMs.</p><p>This chapter then helped us understand how to pre-process text data and prepare it so that we can feed it into LSTMs. We also looked at the model's structure for training. Next, we looked at how to train the neural networks by creating batches of data.</p><p>Finally, we understood how to generate book script using the TensorFlow model we trained. Although the script that was generated doesn't make complete sense, it was amazing to observe the neural network generate a book's sentences. We then saved the generated book script in a text file for future reference.</p><p>In the next chapter, we shall play Pac-Man using deep reinforcement learning. </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
