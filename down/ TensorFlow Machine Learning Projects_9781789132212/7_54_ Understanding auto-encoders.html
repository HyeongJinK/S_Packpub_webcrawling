They are quite popular when it comes to dimensionality reduction of input and in generative models.</p><p>Essentially, an auto-encoder learns to compress data into a low-dimensional representation and then reconstructs that representation into something that matches the original data. This way, the low-dimensional representation ignores the noise, which is not helpful in reconstructing the original data.</p><p>As mentioned previously, they are also useful in generating models, particularly images. For example, if we feed the representation of <span class="emphasis"><em>dog</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>flying</em></span>, it may attempt to generate an image of aÂ <span class="emphasis"><em>flying cat</em></span>, which it has not seen before.</p><p>Structurally, auto-encoders <span>consist</span><a id="id325091912" class="indexterm"></a> of two parts, the encoder and the decoder. The encoder generates the low-dimensional representation of inputs, and the decoder helps regenerate the input from the representation. Generally, the encoder and the decoder are feedforward neural networks with one or multiple hidden layers.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the configuration of a typical auto-encoder:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789132212/graphics/58d3b203-24a9-4fe0-b5f4-e857713392a5.png" /></div><p>To define the encoder (</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789132212/graphics/88a8b741-cea4-485f-abc3-77dbd7709794.png" /></div><p>) and the decoder (</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789132212/graphics/427e0ef4-a4f1-4444-82ab-0297f9a021ff.png" /></div><p>), an auto-encoder can be mathematically represented as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/graphics/9781789132212/graphics/302f7db8-b69e-40f3-b140-b13877d24b78.png" /></div><p>As mentioned in the equation, the parameters of <span>the</span><a id="id325585517" class="indexterm"></a> encoder and the decoder are optimized in a <span>way</span><a id="id325601656" class="indexterm"></a> that minimizes a special kind of error, which is known as <span class="strong"><strong>reconstruction error.</strong></span> Reconstruction error is the error between the reconstructed input and the original input.</p></div>
