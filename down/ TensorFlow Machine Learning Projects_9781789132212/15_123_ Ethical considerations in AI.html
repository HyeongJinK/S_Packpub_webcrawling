However, the growing sophistication of AI applications has raised a number of concerns around bias, fairness, safety, transparency, and accountability. This is mainly because AI models don't have a conscience and can't distinguish good from bad all by themselves. They are as good as the data they are trained on. So, if the data is biased in some sense, so will the predictions be. There are other concerns around rising unemployment due to automation, the use of AI for terrorism, and racist predictions from AI models, among others.</p><p>The good news is that many universities are spending time and resources to come up with solutions on how to make AI more fair and free from bias. At the same time, regulators are trying to frame new rules so that AI applications are safe and secure for humans.</p><p>As an AI practitioner, it is imperative that we understand these issues before using AI in our own products. I urge you to make yourself aware of the ethical issues in your products and correct them accordingly.</p></div>
