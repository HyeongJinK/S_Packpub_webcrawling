The ensembles we took a look at were random forests and gradient boosting trees.</p><p>We also learned about the Kepler dataset from Kaggle competitions. We used the Kepler dataset to build an exoplanet detection model using TensorFlow's prebuilt estimator for gradient boosting trees known as the <code class="literal">BoostedTreesClassifier</code>. The <code class="literal">BoostedTreesClassifier</code> estimator is part of the machine learning toolkit recently released by the TensorFlow team. As for now, the TensorFlow team is working on releasing prebuilt estimators based on <span class="strong"><strong>support vector machine</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SVM</strong></span>) and extreme random forests as part of the <code class="literal">tf.estimators</code> API.</p><p>In the next chapter, we shall learn how to use TensorFlow in the browser using the <code class="literal">TensorFlow.js</code> API for sentiment analysis.</p></div>
