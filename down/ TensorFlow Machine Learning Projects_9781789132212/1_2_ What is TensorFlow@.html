It was initially built at Google for internal consumption and was released publicly on November 9, 2015. Since then, TensorFlow has been extensively used to develop <span>machine</span><a id="id325613196" class="indexterm"></a> learning and deep learning models in several business domains. </p><p>To use TensorFlow in our projects, we need to learn how to program using the TensorFlow API. TensorFlow has multiple APIs that can be used to interact with the library. The TensorFlow APIs are divided into two levels:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Low-level API</strong></span>: The API known as <span>TensorFlow</span><a id="id326419778" class="indexterm"></a> core provides fine-grained lower level functionality. Because of this, this low-level API offers complete control while being used on models. We will cover TensorFlow core in this chapter.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>High-level API</strong></span>: These APIs <span>provide</span><a id="id326419792" class="indexterm"></a> high-level functionalities that have been built on TensorFlow core and are comparatively easier to learn and implement. Some high-level APIs include Estimators, Keras, TFLearn, TFSlim, and Sonnet. We will also cover Keras in this chapter.</li></ul></div></div>
