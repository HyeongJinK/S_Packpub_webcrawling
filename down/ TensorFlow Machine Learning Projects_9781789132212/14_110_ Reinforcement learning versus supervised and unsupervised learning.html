So how is reinforcement learning <span>different</span><a id="id325091927" class="indexterm"></a> from the <span>other</span><a id="id325091936" class="indexterm"></a> two types?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Supervised learning</strong></span>: In supervised learning, the agent learns the model from a training dataset consisting of features and labels. The two most <span>common</span><a id="id325290169" class="indexterm"></a> types of supervised learning problems are regression and classification. Regression refers to predicting the future values based on the model, and classification refers to predicting the categories of the input values.</li><li><span class="strong"><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong></span>: In unsupervised learning, the agent learns the model from a training dataset consisting of only features. The two most <span>common</span><a id="id325585518" class="indexterm"></a> types of unsupervised learning problems are dimensionality reduction and clustering. Dimensionality reduction refers to reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset without altering its natural distribution. Clustering refers to dividing the input data into multiple groups, thus producing clusters or segments.</li></ol></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic" start="3" type="1"><li><span class="strong"><strong>Reinforcement <span>learning</span></strong></span>: In reinforce<span>ment learning, the agent starts with an initial model and then continuously learns the model based on feedback from the environment</span>. An RL agent updates the model by applying supervised or unsupervised learning techniques on a sequence of actions, observations, and rewards. The agent only <span>learns</span><a id="id325601680" class="indexterm"></a> from a reward signal, not from a loss function as in other machine learning approaches. The agent receives the feedback after it has already taken the action, while, in other ML approaches, the feedback is provided at the time of training in terms of loss or error. The data is not <span>i.i.d.</span> (independent and identically distributed) because it depends on previous actions taken, while in other ML approaches data is <span>i.i.d</span>.</li></ol></div></div>
