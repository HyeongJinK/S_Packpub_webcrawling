Today, even more organizations are employing deep learning <span>technologies</span><a id="id326494320" class="indexterm"></a> for analyzing their data, which is often voluminous in nature. Hence, it's imperative that deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow can be combined with big data platforms and pipelines.</p><p>The 2017 Facebook paper regarding training ImageNet in one hour using 256 GPUs spread over 32 servers (<a class="ulink" href="https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/imagenet1kin1h5.pdf" target="_blank">https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/imagenet1kin1h5.pdf</a>) and a recent paper by Hong Kong Baptist University where they train ImageNet in four minutes using 2,048 GPUs (<a class="ulink" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf</a>) prove that distributed AI can be a viable solution.</p><p>The main idea behind distributed AI is that the task can be divided into different processing clusters. A large number of frameworks have been proposed for distributed AI. We can use either distributed TensorFlow or TensorFlowOnSpark, two popular choices for distributed AI. Both have their own sets of pros and cons, as we'll learn in this chapter.</p><p>Applying computationally expensive deep learning applications at a large scale can be an enormous challenge. Using TensorFlowOnSpark, we can distribute these computationally expensive processes in the cluster, enabling us to perform computations at a larger scale.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll explore Yahoo's TensorFlowOnSpark framework for distributed deep learning on <span>Spark</span> clusters. Then, we'll apply TensorFlowOnSpark on a large scale dataset of images and train the network to detect objects. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">The need for distributed AI</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">An introduction to the Apache Spark platform for big data
