The process of deploying the model in production is pretty seamless. </p><p>A potential next step would be to modify the JavaScript to predict sentiment as soon as a word is typed. As we mentioned previously, by deploying the model using TensorFlow.js, you can enable low- latency applications like real-time sentiment prediction without having to interact with the server.</p><p>Finally, we built a neural network in Python and deployed it in JavaScript. However, you can try building the entire model in JavaScript using TensorFlow.js. </p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn about Google's new library, TensorFlow Lite.</p></div>
