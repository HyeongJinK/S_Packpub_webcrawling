These recommendations are created using recommendation system algorithms. Before machine learning based recommendations systems, the recommendations were generated with rule-based <span>systems. </span>However, with the advent of machine learning and neural networks, recommendations have become more accurate. </p><p>In this chapter, we'll learn about recommendation systems. We'll use the Retailrocket dataset to implement a recommendation system in two different ways, using TensorFlow and Keras.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">Recommendation systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Content-based filtering</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Collaborative filtering</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Hybrid systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Matrix factorization</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Introducing the Retailrocket dataset</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Exploring the Retailrocket dataset</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Preprocessing the data</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The matrix factorization model for Retailrocket recommendations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">The neural network model for Retailrocket recommendations</li></ul></div></div>
