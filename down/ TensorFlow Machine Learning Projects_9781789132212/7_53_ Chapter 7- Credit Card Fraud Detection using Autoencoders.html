We are used to performing many of our daily tasks online, such as booking cabs, shopping on e-commerce websites, and even recharging our phones. For the majority of these tasks, we are used to paying with credit cards. However, it is a known fact that a credit card can be compromised, which could result in a fraudulent transaction.
