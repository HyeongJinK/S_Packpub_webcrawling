We touched on deep reinforcement learning concepts, and <span>we encourage you to explore books (mentioned in the further reading)</span> specifically written about reinforcement learning to learn deeply about the theories and concepts.</p><p>We learned how to play the PacMan game in OpenAI Gym. We implemented DQN and used it to learn to play the PacMan game. We only used an MLP network to keep things simple, but, for complex examples, you may end up using complex CNN, RNN, or Sequence-to-Sequence models.</p><p>In the next chapter, we shall learn about future opportunities in the fields of machine learning and TensorFlow.</p></div>
