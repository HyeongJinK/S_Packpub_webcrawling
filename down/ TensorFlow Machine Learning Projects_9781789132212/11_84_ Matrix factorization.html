In this algorithm, the user-item interaction is decomposed into two low-dimensional matrices. For example, let's say all the visitor-item interactions in our dataset are M x N matrix, denoted by A. Matrix factorization decomposes matrix A into two matrices of M x k and k x N dimensions respectively, such that the dot product of these two can approximate matrix A. Some of the <span>more</span><a id="id326503822" class="indexterm"></a> popular algorithms for finding the low-dimensional matrix are based on <span class="strong"><strong>Singular Value Decomposition</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SVD</strong></span>). In the following example, we'll use the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to implement matrix factorization.</p></div>
