In a decision tree algorithm, the data is divided into two partitions by using a simple rule. The rule is applied again and again to further partition the data, thus forming a tree of decisions.</p><p>Ensemble methods combine the learning from multiple learning algorithms to improve predictions and reduce errors. These ensembles are differentiated on the basis of what kind of learners they use and how they structure those learns in the ensemble.</p><p>The two most popular ensemble methods based on decision trees are known as gradient boosted trees and random forests. </p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc">What is a decision tree?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Why we need ensembles?</li><li style="list-style-type: disc">Decision tree-based ensemble methods
